0	Used to be heavily into this series. When season 1 came on TV and I caught notice of it I bought all the books and have since been heavily into the lore. Sadly the two last seasons have completly ruined this series for me.The writing is horrible and it really shows that D&D are nothing but frauds, as soon as they ran out of book material the show went south fast! I'd love to rate it higher but season 8 is possible the worst that have been sent on tv in recent history (and I used to watch the walking dead...).	use heavily series season come tv catch notice buy book since heavily lore sadly two last season completly ruin series write horrible really show nothing fraud soon run book material show go south fast love rate high season possible bad send tv recent history use watch walk dead

And this is the main problem with this show, it was ""modernized"" for ""modern"" audiences. Something a show about 17th century feudal Japan does not need.We have all the tropes of modern shows - cliff hangers, extremely long and pointless establishing shots, ""witty"" dialogue, gray and brown tones for ""realism"", and pointless changes to the original story for no apparent reason.Do yourself a favor and watch the 1980s show instead. It's superior in pretty much every way, and was actually shot in Japan, unlike the new one that was shot in Canada for some reason."	funny hour mini series actually long episode normal series main problem show modernize modern audience something show th century feudal japan need trope modern show cliff hanger extremely long pointless establish shot witty dialogue gray brown tone realism pointless change original story apparent reason favor watch show instead superior pretty much every way actually shoot japan unlike new one shoot canada reason
2	You shouldn't forget one thing while watching: most of us are watching from the comfort of a sane mind free of major trauma of the like. If you make it to episode 6, you get the insight into Donny's mind and that might relieve you from the frustration that engulfs you every time Donny doesn't tell Martha off, shout at her, block her, report her, or even beat her to pulp. That's what we feel we would do, but Donny isn't us, and there are plenty of Donnys out there.Apart from being a good showing of a stalking situation especially with the usual gender roles reversed, it gives a great representation of how a traumatized person relates to any kind of attention - or dare I say love - they can scoop up.Definitely a very hard watch, not only because of depictions of sexual violence or of downspiral into drugs and self-destruction, but also because of this intricate form of self-harm that I'm afraid numerous people live in - at least in their own unique way.If you take away anything from this show, it should be understanding and acceptance, that people don't always react the way you would and they don't deserve blame for it. If anything, this should put a new twist to victim shaming and give realization that we don't know the full story. We almost never know the whole story.Spiced with some serious acting, strong imagery and powerful music, this show hits hardest when you lay in bed at night and think about how all this, in fact, happened in real life.Balancing on the border of a documentary, this is a strong one, a tough one, and one that stays with you.	forget one thing watch we watch comfort sane mind free major trauma like make episode get insight donny mind might relieve frustration engulf every time donny tell martha shout block report even beat pulp feel would donny we plenty donny apart good show stalk situation especially usual gender role reverse give great representation traumatize person relate kind attention dare say love scoop definitely hard watch depiction sexual violence downspiral drug self destruction also intricate form self harm afraid numerous people live least unique way take away anything show understand acceptance people always react way would deserve blame anything put new twist victim sham give realization know full story almost never know whole story spice serious act strong imagery powerful music show hit hard lie bed night think fact happen real life balance border documentary strong one tough one one stay
2	"Its about a guy called Thomas Ripley who goes to Italy to convience his supposed friend to go back to America and later ended up killing and impersonating him The first thing i would like to address, is all the negative reviews. Most of them compares this show to the ""Talented Mr. Ripley"" movie and argues Andrew Scott is too old to play Ripley. I beg to differ! I normally like to judge the show as it is, the reality of what it intends to portray and if it delivers on that.Who is Tom Ripley? And How is he supposed to be portrayed?. Ripley is a con artist, who can forge passports, create fake IDs, murder in his convience, lie to the police and impersonate people. This type of experties needs years to accumulate and perfect and thats why it makes more sense if Ripley is an older guy who looks like is in his late forties than Matt's twentiesh look.The tv show took time to show us who Ripley was before he went to Europe which justifies what he does when he reaches there. There is something so cold about Andrew's Ripley persona that hits you as you watch the show that justifies him commiting those murders. But Matt Damon's Ripley is abit different, he kinda looks naive and innocent. Like a kid who is learning to be con artist but doesnt have the experties to kill and evade police all over Europe.Other characters have more depth and personality than in the movie. Talk about Marge, in the Tv show she is made to be smart and curious. Just not some girl who is madly in love with her cheating boyfriend and follows him around like in the movie. And this serves its purpose in the movie as her curiosity justifies why she would be so curious about the truth on accusation of murder made against her fiance and Ripley's intentions. Dickie in the movie was more interesting than in the show thou. A guy who living in Europe without working depending on his dad's money is probably supposed to have charisma, he is supposed to be irresponsible and fun. The Italian inspector who was on Dickies case was better in the show. He managed to give you that annoying aura of detectives as they investigate stuff intellegently.The tv show also took sometime in crafting justified sequence of events. In the boat scene, Ripley trying to hide the body and burn evidence makes sense. The murder of Freddie and trying to evade the police. You can feel the sheer chill as walls close on Ripley.People also did have the problem with black and white cinematography. I agree, it didnt strike me at first but as the show precided i came to understand its purpose. It fits the genre ( murder mystery) and the period which the story takes placeThe dialogue was okay as in it wasnt cringy and it befits the time the story takes place and the ethinicity of the characters It is a great show, i highly recommend it so ignore the negative review and enjoy."	guy call thomas ripley go italy convience suppose friend go back america later end kill impersonate first thing would like address negative review compare show talente mr ripley movie argue andrew scott old play ripley beg differ normally like judge show reality intend portray deliver tom ripley suppose portray ripley con artist forge passport create fake id murder convience lie police impersonate people type expertie need year accumulate perfect that s make sense ripley old guy look like late forty matt twentiesh look tv show take time show we ripley go europe justify reach something cold andrew ripley persona hit watch show justify commit murder matt damon ripley abit different kinda look naive innocent like kid learn con artist do not expertie kill evade police europe character depth personality movie talk marge tv show make smart curious girl madly love cheat boyfriend follow around like movie serve purpose movie curiosity justify would curious truth accusation murder make fiance ripley intentions dickie movie interest show thou guy live europe without work depend dad money probably suppose charisma suppose irresponsible fun italian inspector dickie case well show manage give annoy aura detective investigate stuff intellegently tv show also take sometime craft justify sequence event boat scene ripley try hide body burn evidence make sense murder freddie try evade police feel sheer chill wall close ripley people also problem black white cinematography agree do not strike first show precide come understand purpose fit genre murder mystery period story take placethe dialogue okay be not cringy befit time story take place ethinicity character great show highly recommend ignore negative review enjoy
0	I love the games and the Fallout universe, but from a story and character perspective, this was terrible. I found myself disinterested whenever the two main characters weren't on screen. Maximum, in particular, was unbearable without the others. I'm eager for a fan edit that removes this character and most of the ghouls' backstory, which was mostly pointless.Fallout has explored Vault-Tec's history in many other ways that didn't just spoon-feed us information and instead allowed us to piece things together. This approach felt like poor planning or storytelling.While it was great to see the world, the locations seemed to be taken directly from the games with nothing new.In short, it's a lot of fan service and not much else.	love game fallout universe story character perspective terrible find disintereste whenever two main character screen maximum particular unbearable without other eager fan edit remove character ghoul backstory mostly pointless fallout explore vault tec history many way spoon fee we information instead allow us piece thing together approach feel like poor plan storytelle great see world location seem take directly game nothing new short lot fan service much else

0	"Andrew Scott is an amazing actor but, they got it wrong here as Tom Ripley. Tom Ripley is a 25 year old who is charming yet slick and slippery. He is the protagonist and antagonist and that's why he is so alluring however, they missed the mark here. I don't know what they were thinking casted Scott when there are so many actors that fit better and would be more convincing. Also, to have us believe he is ""friends"" with Dickie who's aged in his twenties is unbelievable. For Dickie to want to hang out with someone that's not around his age is also unbelievable. It's cringy honestly. Lastly, Scott looks nothing like Johnny Flynn and somehow he'll get away with being his age when he's in his upper 40's!!! LOL. So to have Tom take over Dickie's life is unjust as well. Hard fail in this all together. If they would have casted Tom correctly this would have been perfect to watch. Most of the story telling was close to the book and I did enjoy how it was filmed. I didn't like how Tom freely told Dickie right away his dad sent him too. But I could deal with the little issues. I unfortunately couldn't continue to watch trying to force myself into believing it and this was definitely a big let down. Andrew Scott as Tom Ripley?!? Oh and the book takes place in 1955....they didn't get that right either.

2	When I saw the title on the Disney channel I assume it's one of those mock Asian war drama we always see on the screen with fake mock Asian token actors like we always see. I can not be more wrong. The richness in characters is built on real Japanese actors who are world class actors in the film/Tv industry and the depiction of the religious and political tension is something I have not seen on a main stream service for long time. Not to mention how rare we get to hear Japanese spoken with majority of the air time on an English language channel. This authentic Japanese/Englsih drama is exceptionally well made and has the potential to lead the white audience into a new realm of Asian western fusion genre. I expect some awards to be won shortly.	see title disney channel assume one mock asian war drama always see screen fake mock asian token actor like always see wrong richness character build real japanese actor world class actor film tv industry depiction religious political tension something see main stream service long time mention rare get hear japanese speak majority air time english language channel authentic japanese englsih drama exceptionally well make potential lead white audience new realm asian western fusion genre expect award shortly
1	Everything ties together so nicely of present and past.The characters are built just nicely, really good choice of songs,the juxtaposition of old songs with future world was humourous and ironic.Excessive Capitalism is explored till the point of god like decisions being taken.There was Instances of bad cgi but this was over taken by the good designs of the gulper,giant roaches,and the beautiful western accent of the ghoul.An energy and resources control is still being waged by various factions vying for power.The show was beautiful executed though we would love if more creaturess were shown,more of those giant machine suits being used and explanation for what powers them or where those ospreys wer getting their fuel from.Each episode was an hour long, it's obvious lots of thought went to it,this is Loki style writing and we are all here for it.	everything tie together nicely present past character build nicely really good choice song juxtaposition old song future world humourous ironic excessive capitalism explore till point god like decision take instance bad cgi take good design gulper giant roach beautiful western accent ghoul energy resource control still wag various faction vie power show beautiful execute though would love creaturess show giant machine suit use explanation power osprey wer get fuel episode hour long obvious lot think go loki style write

2	"Walking in I was sceptical. Having been really only into the fallout universe since fallout 3, I wasn't a purist. The budget and effects whilst not ""perfect"" are certainly not janky enough to detract from the visual spectacle. The characters are unique and flawed, there so far seems to me an absence of ""the message"" and it's a good , fun watch. Is it a mind blowing experience? No, is it a fun hour watching some post apocalyptic mayhem? Yes certainly. There is no absence of gore and a plethora of nostalgia. For me that wasn't enough not to like and it is probably one of the best ""game to screen"" adaptations so far. For me above ""The Last Of Us""."	walk sceptical really fallout universe since fallout purist budget effect whilst perfect certainly janky enough detract visual spectacle character unique flaw far seem absence message good fun watch mind blow experience fun hour watch post apocalyptic mayhem yes certainly absence gore plethora nostalgia enough like probably one good game screen adaptation far last we
1	The Rookie is at best an enjoyable diversion. I frankly didn't think it would be renewed for a second season. Often it can't seem to figure out if it is a comedy or a drama. The current ongoing plot with super-villain Rosalind is getting REALLY tiresome and the spin-off series, The Rookie Feds, is just plain silly. Please don't air any tie-ins which will require me to watch The Rookie Feds as rather than have to do that I will instead stop watching The Rookie! Another super-silly plot involving look-alike characters was cartoonish and a complete turnoff. I would like to enjoy this series; the characters are relatable and show development and I like them all but the increasingly silly plots and the tiresome Rosalind thing have me about ready to stop watching the show.	rookie good enjoyable diversion frankly think would renew second season often seem figure comedy drama current ongoing plot super villain rosalind get really tiresome spin series rookie feds plain silly please air tie in require watch rookie feds rather instead stop watch rookie another super silly plot involve look alike character cartoonish complete turnoff would like enjoy series character relatable show development like increasingly silly plot tiresome rosalind thing ready stop watch show

0	I have been looking forward to this immensely since I first read of its production. I'm a huge fan of the novels and have read them repeatedly over the years as I have grown older and taken a different view of the characters each time. I am a fan of the earlier adaptation of the first novel as I am of various other adaptations of the character, all bringing something different from the pages of Patricia's novels. What was this though? All playfulness and excitement was removed and the wily title character reduced to a monotone bore. As for the supporting cast that was even worse. No chemistry, no motives, no engagement in what was happening at all. The direction was absolutely foul! I have no issue with the black and white approach but what was with the constant slide show of repeated images? It was like watching an amateur film school adaptation. I actually hope they don't adapt any of the other novels because they don't deserve this. The young cad turned into an eight part high end car commercial and just so there is no confusion here that isn't a complement in the slightest.	look forward immensely since first read production huge fan novel read repeatedly year grow old take different view character time fan early adaptation first novel various adaptation character bring something different page patricia novel though playfulness excitement remove wily title character reduce monotone bore support cast even bad chemistry motive engagement happen direction absolutely foul issue black white approach constant slide show repeat image like watch amateur film school adaptation actually hope adapt novel deserve young cad turn eight part high end car commercial confusion complement slight
0	This was never a great show, but it was a good enough relaxing and chill cop show, like Castle... it was interesting to watch the relationships between T. O and Rookie, on top of that a 40 yo old police rookie is actually an interesting premise, even tho it felt like every episode something reaaaaally high profile and unlikely happened, and I rather they kept it casual and simple, focus on the relationship while doing real police work, I never felt like dropping the show... what the hell happened... Tim was my favorite character by far, I loved Chen, and Nolan was very likable and relatable. Why did they have to ruin it... My favorite cop show is The Mentalist, and I was hoping this one was at least good enough to finish...	never great show good enough relax chill cop show like castle interest watch relationships rookie top yo old police rookie actually interest premise even tho feel like every episode something reaaaaally high profile unlikely happen rather keep casual simple focus relationship real police work never feel like drop show hell happen tim favorite character far love chen nolan likable relatable ruin favorite cop show mentalist hop one least good enough finish
1	"Despite having magic, dragons and supernatural creatures in it, it was much more plot- and character-driven. Most of the charme came from smart conversations, like in Jackie Brown(imho the best Tarantino movie, yet underrated because it doesn't have much action).One can say that I liked the show because it was different. It didn't mind to break with conventions, it didn't pander to what the majority expected and it didn't show you everything (like the battles), which made the few scenes with some sword fights all the more powerful.Then came season 4 and season 5. The show started to slip and fast. Basically with the death of Tywin Lannister, it said goodbye to everything that made it once great. The 2 best schemers(Varys and Littlefinger) who could have a show of their own and set in motion 90% of the plot left King's Landing and hardly had any role in the show anymore. The interesting characters with edges and flaws were killed off because the creators didn't like them(Stannis). The way that was done was an insult to anyone who kept watching after that.The big threat that we should worry about were always the zombie-like creatures up north. Who are they? Where do they come from? Why do they want to kill everyone? Don't hope for answers. The ""big threat"" is dealt with in one episode, of course without answers."	despite magic dragon supernatural creature much plot character drive charme come smart conversation like jackie brown imho good tarantino movie yet underrate much action one say like show different mind break convention pander majority expect show everything like battle make scene sword fight powerful come season season show start slip fast basically death tywin lannister say goodbye everything make great good schemer vary littlefinger could show set motion plot leave king land hardly role show anymore interest character edge flaw kill creator like stannis way do insult anyone keep watch big threat worry always zombie like creature north come want kill everyone hope answer big threat deal one episode course without answer

The story revolves around scientists, however they are portrayed as if they are high school students, both in how they behave and what they talk about and every apect of scientific nature is dumbed down for the audience (""These damn scientists be doing their science n' stuff"") .

1	"If this wasn't the biggest deception in TV series history, then I don't know what is. This show rode on the idea of a Shogun. In Japanese folklore, a Shogun was a very powerful military commander who was second to only the Emperor and he commanded a large army. And if you controlled the army, you almost nearly are in control of the country. So when this dude, Toranaga, who comes from a long line of Shoguns, is exiled and on the verge of being killed by the then rulers of Japan, we are taking on this journey of discovery. Will he become Shogun and take on these rulers? And if he won't, then what will be do?After a long wait which spanned 9 episodes of boring, long speech, great cinematography and excellent acting we are presented with a poorly written, incredibly dissatisfying ending. Honestly it felt like we, the viewers, were the ones the trick was played on. There was no Shogun, there was no grand battle, there was no ""crimson sky"", there was no justice served, and the only deaths were those of his loyal followers who sacrificed themselves, all for what?!If not for the amazing scenes, cinematography and acting, I would have given this a 3/10. The story just sucked big time."	big deception tv series history know show ride idea shogun japanese folklore shogun powerful military commander second emperor command large army control army almost nearly control country dude toranaga come long line shogun exile verge kill ruler japan take journey discovery become shogun take ruler long wait span episode bear long speech great cinematography excellent act present poorly write incredibly dissatisfy end honestly feel like viewer one trick play shogun grand battle crimson sky justice serve death loyal follower sacrifice amaze scene cinematography act would give story suck big time
1	Loved Nathan Fillion from Castle and the first few years years of this show was pretty decent. But once they started to bring in the FBI spin off with a character who dresses like a Wive's Club Mom instead of a Federal Agent. She'd never be allowed to show that much cleavage when every other female agent is in a pant suit.This last episode where they make a gun carrying guy the bad guy because he pulls his weapon is more typical Hollywood crap people are sick of watching coming into their shows.As mentioned by other viewers, the constant love connections is as bad as watching Grey's Anatomy where every one is sleeping w/a coworker. This isn't Love Connection. It's supposed to be a Police Drama. Stick to that.	love nathan fillion castle first year year show pretty decent start bring fbi spin character dress like wive club mom instead federal agent never allow show much cleavage every female agent pant suit last episode make gun carry guy bad guy pull weapon typical hollywood crap people sick watch come show mention viewer constant love connection bad watch grey anatomy every one sleep w coworker love connection suppose police drama stick
0	"Title: ""Disappointing Series: A Missed Opportunity""As a dedicated fan of the genre, I was eagerly anticipating the release of shogun. However, after investing countless hours into watching it, I can confidently say that it fell far short of expectations.Firstly, the plot was convoluted and poorly executed. Instead of a cohesive narrative that drew me in, I found myself struggling to follow the numerous subplots that seemed to go nowhere. The pacing was inconsistent, with episodes dragging on without any meaningful development, only to rush through important moments later on.Furthermore, the characters lacked depth and failed to resonate with me. They felt like mere caricatures, with little to no growth throughout the series. I found it difficult to empathize or connect with any of them, which made it challenging to invest in their journeys.On top of that, the acting left much to be desired. Dialogue delivery felt forced and unnatural, making it difficult to immerse myself in the story. It was evident that the actors were struggling to breathe life into poorly written lines, resulting in performances that fell flat.Lastly, the production quality was subpar. From the mediocre special effects to the uninspired cinematography, it was clear that corners were cut in the production process. Scenes that were supposed to be climactic fell short due to lackluster visual effects, leaving me underwhelmed and disappointed.Overall, shogun was a missed opportunity. With a more coherent plot, well-developed characters, stronger performances, and higher production values, it could have been something truly special. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver on almost every level, leaving me feeling like I wasted my time."	title disappoint series miss opportunity dedicate fan genre eagerly anticipate release shogun however invest countless hour watch confidently say fall far short expectation firstly plot convolute poorly execute instead cohesive narrative draw find struggle follow numerous subplot seem go nowhere pace inconsistent episode drag without meaningful development rush important moment later furthermore character lack depth fail resonate feel like mere caricature little growth throughout series find difficult empathize connect make challenge invest journey top act leave much desire dialogue delivery feel force unnatural make difficult immerse story evident actor struggle breathe life poorly write line result performance fall flat lastly production quality subpar mediocre special effect uninspired cinematography clear corner cut production process scene suppose climactic fall short due lackluster visual effect leave underwhelmed disappoint overall shogun miss opportunity coherent plot well develop character strong performance high production value could something truly special unfortunately fail deliver almost every level leave feel like waste time
0	Being an FX show, I thought this would be for an english speaking audience. The small amount of english that is spoken in by british actors with strong accents. The rest is all Japanese with english subtitles. Why networks think we want to read TV instead of watch it is beyond me. If I wanted to read it, I would buy the book (which is always better than the movie or TV)! No matter how good the show is, many of us will not watch it due to the almost total subtitling. I didn't even get through half of the first episode, and like many, will not watch any more. Too bad that FX has so little regard for such a large portion of its viewing audience.	fx show think would english speak audience small amount english speak british actor strong accent rest japanese english subtitle network think want read tv instead watch beyond want read would buy book always well movie tv matter good show many we watch due almost total subtitle even get half first episode like many watch bad fx little regard large portion view audience

2	"Shogun has clawed back some pride in television series production, presenting a truly compelling and intricate historical period-epic offering that has clearly done its homework in getting the accuracy and details spot-on. Shogun sports astonishingly good colour grading, mesmerising performances, and excellent costuming throughout.Depicting the feudal period of the saber-rattling Japans, political crossfire abounds as the far-flung Christian world meets the isolationist honour-bound Japanese, the culture shock depicted onscreen is oftentimes revelatory, sometimes funny, and occasionally chilling. It is a title that evokes an age when Japan was separated from the rest of the world, not just by the roiling East Asian seas, but by religion, economics, and, most importantly, culture.This is a clinical, mature, and sober outing from Disney, and most certainly a world-class effort in exploring the rich world of feudal Japan through period dramatisation. Retaining dialogue in Japanese with subtitles and casting Japanese actors are hallmarks of its faithfulness to representing an authentic setting. This thrillingly realises James Clavell's bestselling book for the screen.There have been justified complaints about Shogun not featuring the lingua franca of that era (Portuguese) with English being oddly referred to as ""Portuguese"". At that time, Portuguese was used for communications between Europeans and Japanese (the Portuguese were the first to arrive in 1543). However, a fully accurate portrayal of the story would be entirely in Portuguese and Japanese, and all of Shogun would have to include subtitles. I think they were mistaken to not have some characters speaking subtitled Portuguese, but clearly made the decision on grounds of accessibility for English speakers. I don't feel it undermines the story enough to be a major issue.8.5/10."	shogun claw back pride television series production present truly compel intricate historical period epic offer clearly do homework get accuracy detail spot shogun sport astonishingly good colour grade mesmerise performances excellent costume throughout depict feudal period saber rattle japan political crossfire abound far fle christian world meet isolationist honour bind japanese culture shock depict onscreen oftentime revelatory sometimes funny occasionally chill title evoke age japan separate rest world roil east asian seas religion economic importantly culture clinical mature sober out disney certainly world class effort explore rich world feudal japan period dramatisation retain dialogue japanese subtitle cast japanese actor hallmarks faithfulness represent authentic set thrillingly realise jam clavell bestselle book screen justify complaint shogun feature lingua franca era portuguese english oddly refer portuguese time portuguese use communication europeans japanese portuguese first arrive however fully accurate portrayal story would entirely portuguese japanese shogun would include subtitle think mistake character speak subtitle portuguese clearly make decision ground accessibility english speaker feel undermine story enough major issue
0	One star is a little harsh, but only because I'm comparing it to the original, which is much better. This new series has beautiful and updated photography but lacks the compelling depth, acting and superior story telling of the first. The 1980 version was an amazing study in culture and politics while this one feels more like a Transformer movie. Perhaps if you haven't seen the first, you'll not know what you're missing and can enjoy it for what it is. Trying to remake a classic is hard I applaud the artists' efforts, I realize it's a different telling of the story. I've seen remakes that I thought were good, and with that being said, for me, this one just doesn't hit the mark.	one star little harsh compare original much well new series beautiful update photography lack compel depth act superior story tell first version amaze study culture politic one feel like transformer movie perhaps see first know miss enjoy try remake classic hard applaud artist effort realize different tell story see remake think good say one hit mark

1	"It's not the ""soapiness"" that makes the show aggravating its the inaccuracies especially when talking about really important things. It's like the writers want to bring up these social issues but don't have experience or an education on what they actually are. It's seriously like the show is written by people who haven't met other people. All of the characters are incredibly insecure which ALWAYS affects their patients health- these may be the worst fake surgeons on the planet. I would genuinely be afraid to enter this hospital because I'd probably be killed. Not because anything is actually wrong with me but because the doctors are just mad at each-other. There are so many times that the best doctor in the show, Shepard, almost kills his patient because he refuses to listen to his wife or his residents. And it's not because their wrong it's always because they've offended him in some really minor way. The accuracy of the series is overridden by the need to create drama. It makes me uncomfortable that young people are expected to take lessons from a show that doesn't have a understanding on what it's teaching. This show would probably be better as a rom-com as it seems to miss the nail when it's tries to create convincing drama. It's a fun watch though!! It reminds me of a E! reality tv series. I physically can't stop watching though so obviously the writers are doing something right."	soapiness make show aggravate inaccuracy especially talk really important thing like writer want bring social issue experience education actually seriously like show write people meet people character incredibly insecure always affect patient health may worst fake surgeon planet would genuinely afraid enter hospital probably kill anything actually wrong doctor mad many time good doctor show shepard almost kill patient refuse listen wife resident wrong always offend really minor way accuracy series override need create drama make uncomfortable young people expect take lesson show understand teach show would probably well rom com seem miss nail try create convince drama fun watch though remind e reality tv series physically stop watch though obviously writer something right
2	Grey's Anatomy is a surprisingly addictive show. The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. Sandra Oh stands out for her comic timing, but the entire cast is superb. It's not as grave as ER, but is just as compelling. Also, it's a little more accessible than ER and some of the more serious medical dramas. The show is definitely worth catching--if you can't watch it when it airs, TiVo it or rent the first season DVD. It's well worth the time spent! It's great for marathon viewings!	grey anatomy surprisingly addictive show plot line interest blend soap opera drama comedy really like anything else time occasionally feel pedestrian however well do good write great act well direct sandra oh stand comic time entire cast superb grave er compel also little accessible er serious medical drama show definitely worth catch watch air tivo rent first season dvd well worth time spend great marathon view
1	I loved this show, but since season 3 it has become too political.Why do shows insist on doing this? Leave the politics to the politicians. TV shows are too one-sided in their portrayal of current views, they go after the popular view, they do not give both sides.	love show since season become political show insist leave politic politician tv show one side portrayal current view go popular view give side
1	As someone who didn't read the books, I have mixed feelings.While the first half of the season gradually built up to a great catastrophe, the second half could have been condensed and saved for a second season.Some of the characters, like Auggie, Jin and Ye, are very interesting to watch but a good few of them feel very unserious for a good portion of the time, so it broke lots of the tension and seriousness I enjoyed about the show.There are many, many small plot holes surrounding the Santis and their purpose. Certain pieces of their story and mission contradict or go without explanation. I'm sure the books are probably more precise about this, but for one I didn't enjoy that this story is primarily about humans being pitted against each other in seemingly shallow, emotion-driven conflict when these characters were introduced as powerful scientists and leaders. At one point, the Santis display their immense power and control over humanity with their technology and are nothing short of terrifying. A psychotic, one-note zealot isn't enough to create an interesting villain and we need to expand on this.The highs are really high and I appreciated that. The story's plot is strong and original, but rushed. It wasn't a pain to watch, but I wasn't exactly satisfied by the end of it either.	someone read book mix feel first half season gradually build great catastrophe second half could condense save second season character like auggie jin ye interest watch good feel unserious good portion time break lot tension seriousness enjoy show many many small plot hole surround santis purpose certain piece story mission contradict go without explanation sure book probably precise one enjoy story primarily human pit seemingly shallow emotion drive conflict character introduce powerful scientist leader one point santis display immense power control humanity technology nothing short terrify psychotic one note zealot enough create interest villain need expand high really high appreciate story plot strong original rush pain watch exactly satisfy end either
0	Here's my impression after the 2nd episode. They spent so much money on Bethesda rights and Johnny Cash music that they couldn't hire an adequate writer. Bu dum chhhh.It's a hodge podge of uncertain tone and poor character writing. The script and storyline are sloppy.I've played Fallout a bit, and this world is a good aesthetic copy so far. If that's ALL I wanted, I'd just play the game. I'll give that point to them anyways.It had some promise in the first episode. A bit meh, but not all pilots are winners. The characters were introduced, and a story began. Bare minimum set up really.Highlight: Kyle McLaughlin. I love the guy. But I didn't care one bit about his character.The second episode is embarrassing to watch. The music made me cringe and there was no logic in the fight scene. Did you hire Neil Breen as an editor? A yodeler losing their voice on the soundtrack? A literal child as the director?It feels like it wants to be the mandalorian (sp?). But instead of being an appropriately paced adventure, it punches you in the face with lame violence and awkward savagery. And not the good kind of awkward, because it's neither funny nor charming. I didn't laugh once.It's a shame, really. With better writing, this could be really fun! It could be a fish out of water story, with an overly optimistic main protagonist in a harsh world. But it relies too much on aesthetic of the video game without making an interesting story to go along with it.Whatever it's doing, it's shaky. I'd rather watch a show with solid characters and story development.I'll update if I can even keep watching this. But honestly I'd rather just play the video game. I don't have time for sloppy memberberry shows.	impression nd episode spend much money bethesda right johnny cash music hire adequate writer bu dum chhhh hodge podge uncertain tone poor character write script storyline sloppy play fallout bite world good aesthetic copy far want play game give point anyways promise first episode bite meh pilot winner character introduce story begin bare minimum set really highlight kyle mclaughlin love guy care one bite character second episode embarrass watch music make cringe logic fight scene hire neil breen editor yodeler lose voice soundtrack literal child director feel like want mandalorian sp instead appropriately pace adventure punch face lame violence awkward savagery good kind awkward neither funny charm laugh shame really well write could really fun could fish water story overly optimistic main protagonist harsh world rely much aesthetic video game without make interest story go along whatever shaky rather watch show solid character story development update even keep watch honestly rather play video game time sloppy memberberry show
2	Fallout is even better than I expected. It's up there as one of the best video game adaptations ever. Fallout takes pace a couple hundred years after a nuclear apocalypse and people have to live in underground bunkers to protect themselves. There is a world going on above full of radiation that's created mutants and a lawless society full of evil people and violence. All the people living in these underground communities are forced to come up and live. Ella Purcell stars as Lucy, one of the people who's never been above ground before and wasn't prepared for the lawless society it has become. One of the most underrated actors ever in Walton Goggins steals the show once again as a mutant bandit. This series is just flat out awesome.	fallout even well expect one good video game adaptation ever fallout take pace couple hundred year nuclear apocalypse people live underground bunker protect world go full radiation create mutant lawless society full evil people violence people live underground community force come live ella purcell star lucy one people never grind prepare lawless society become one underrate actor ever walton goggin steal show mutant bandit series flat awesome

0	The choice of actors is bad, especially the main actress E. Gonzalez is a total failure for this type of series. She's just a pretty face and nothing more, she's completely unconvincing as a serious and highly intelligent scientist (she's just really bad at acting because she doesn't know how to act the right emotions). This is not helped by the uneven screenplay, which oscillates between interesting, already seen and stupid. A lot of theses are forced and stretched, and the scene with stopping the Doomsday ship with nano-fibers is completely unnecessary and illogical (it was possible to get hold of the data disk in a hundred other ways). All over the planet, people went wild and started killing each other because aliens will come in 400 years?! And smart scientists believe that aliens are not capable of lying and deceiving? WTF? I seriously wonder what goes on in the minds of the screenwriters today. This series is kind of a bad mix of Terminator, The Matrix, The Truman Show and Star Trek. Could and should be better and more intelligent if they aimed at adults.	choice actor bad especially main actress e gonzalez total failure type series pretty face nothing completely unconvincing serious highly intelligent scientist really bad act know act right emotion help uneven screenplay oscillate interest already see stupid lot theses force stretch scene stop doomsday ship nano fiber completely unnecessary illogical possible get hold datum disk hundred way planet people go wild start kill alien come year smart scientist believe alien capable lie deceive wtf seriously wonder go mind screenwriter today series kind bad mix terminator matrix truman show star trek could better intelligent aim adult

0	From the team that bought you GOT, but this was in my opinion a fail.Sure some GOT cast make appearances, but they can't save this slow burn and lack of energy this series brings.There is nothing really making you want to come back and watch each episode, no cliff hanger or ohh what's going to happen moment.It's slow burn with little to no real answers 4 episodes in. The time chopping get annoying and yet also doesn't help answer any solid questions. It's lacking story and plot and over arching theme, much like the back end of GOT, just lacking solid story telling that keeps the watcher engaged.Is disappointing as I wanted to enjoy this and buy into it, but I can't it's missing that GOT buy in that something extra.	team buy get opinion fail sure get cast make appearance save slow burn lack energy series bring nothing really make want come back watch episode cliff hanger ohh go happen moment slow burn little real answer episode time chop get annoy yet also help answer solid question lack story plot arch theme much like back end get lack solid story tell keep watcher engage disappoint want enjoy buy miss get buy something extra

Absolutely shameless..	use great series watch escape horrific society create politic racism manage squeeze make exponentially bad even insult time webber bailey dynamic use absolute favorite even character get strangle politic agenda writer seem impose audience absolutely shameless
0	How can you introduce so many things into the world while still not really explaining a single one of them. This first episode which should have set the tone for the rest of the series just threw many concepts of the Fallout universe at the viewer's face without even taking two seconds to elaborate.What are these bunkers? Who build them? How did the people get there? What are the Brothers of Steel and why should we care? Why are there these metal giants? What is the enclave? Who are those raiders? What happened to bunker 32? ...I get it that these questions may be answered later, but I don't feel like continuing when not even a single thing has been properly established in over one hour.	introduce many thing world still really explain single one first episode set tone rest series throw many concept fallout universe view face without even take two second elaborate bunker build people get brother steel care metal giant enclave raider happen bunker get question may answer later feel like continue even single thing properly establish one hour
1	I've really enjoyed GoT as a whole. Not everything has been perfect, but most shows are like that, and this is not your average TV-show.. This is an extremely rare genre - a dark fantasy show, i'm willing to cut them some slack. It's too bad about S8 though, i even liked the previous, rather fast paced season (which many people despised). Episode 4 of S8 really ruined a lot i think - it's overall sloppy and just plain dumb, very little effort and thought was put into it. You can tell the creators just got tired of it but continued due to it still making the $$$. We never asked for this.	really enjoy get whole everything perfect show like average tv show extremely rare genre dark fantasy show will cut slack bad though even like previous rather fast pace season many people despise episode really ruin lot think overall sloppy plain dumb little effort think put tell creator get tire continue due still make never ask

0	While I was so excited for this series, being a lover of the original Talented Mr. Ripley movie, I was very pleased with the black and white cinematography and some of the new locations shown.However, the acting is so boring and flat, the episodes are unnecessarily screeched out leaving important details of the book out that tie important events. The second part is the acting, the only character I enjoyed dies early (Dicky), the rest fall so short, Marge does not reflect any good or bad emotions as her character is so flat, almost invisible. Tom is trying to hard to look the part, he does not even show his romantic affection for Dickie on this adaptation. I am not even sure, why the script is so poor and simplistic on every scene, the essence of the book is lost completely. It was painful to watch. I wish the writer would done better and the director would of paid more attention to the acting.	excite series lover original talente mr ripley movie please black white cinematography new location show however act bear flat episode unnecessarily screech leave important detail book tie important event second part act character enjoy die early dicky rest fall short marge reflect good bad emotion character flat almost invisible tom try hard look part even show romantic affection dickie adaptation even sure script poor simplistic every scene essence book lose completely painful watch wish writer would do well director would pay attention act
1	"I just finished this series. The writers took the goofiness of the games and copy/pasted it over into the show, expecting game goofiness during horrific events to translate well over to show goofiness during horrific events. This is a similar flavor as the ""horror comedy,"" which I think is an abomination, save a few rare examples. Like during a massacre, one of the vault leaders is more concerned about the caterers bringing out the jello too early. I mean, he's literally being chased by a machete wielding maniac when he says this. That's the kind of mood-killing cringe that peppers through this show. You know that feeling where you get invested in a mediocre show? And you know there's better things to watch out there, but you aren't invested in those; you're invested in this mediocre show, and you know it's not going to get better, but too bad, you're invested. That's what watching Fallout felt like.The backgrounds, effects, and general world building is pretty cool, and definitely captures that Fallout vibe. I give it a 7 because of the nostalgia, but if I hadn't played the games then I imagine this would be a 5 or 6."	finish series writer take goofiness game copy paste show expect game goofiness horrific event translate well show goofiness horrific event similar flavor horror comedy think abomination save rare example like massacre one vault leader concern caterer bring jello early mean literally chase machete wield maniac say kind mood kill cringe pepper show know feel get invest mediocre show know well thing watch invest invest mediocre show know go get well bad invest watch fallout feel like background effect general world build pretty cool definitely capture fallout vibe give nostalgia play game imagine would
2	"It is slow burn and sometimes doesn't deliver the story clearly. It also little bit amusing in first two episodes. I read the book and there are new main characters (that only one scientist developed to five scientists). It is good for the story, so the series not that monotone. In my opinion, it should ended at episode five and the rest of series could be in season two. The closing of episode five made me shiver, not that many TV series could do that.Note: I might have missed this, but why the word ""Trisolarian"" didn't appear in the show? The word repeated in the book though, for naming the Alien."	slow burn sometimes deliver story clearly also little bite amuse first two episode read book new main character one scientist develop five scientist good story series monotone opinion end episode five rest series could season two close episode five make shiver many tv series could note might miss word trisolarian appear show word repeat book though name alien
0	"I recently watched a couple episodes and was appalled. The writing was complete trash and fantasy. The show lacks complete realism and it's apparent the writers neither know anything about actual police work or actual policies. They certainly don't understand such things as ""hazing"", hostile work environments, policies, Officer safety, or undercover operations. Their show is complete BS. It is know wonder citizens have a complete misunderstanding as to what police work is all about and how officers interact with one another. The scene where the young female officer working undercover is kidnapped by co-Workers is laughable at worst and tragic at best. I have spent decades teaching undercover operations and found this particular episode utterly ridiculous. Not to mention the two co-workers would have been indicted on Federal charges for violation of civil rights, kidnapping and torture. She would as become a multi millionaire after she got done suing the city and the Department. Just a side note to the total out of touch uninformed writers on this show. There is no drug case etc worth the life of an officer. To write such C@ap giving the impression officers work undercover with no regard for their safety is complete fiction and a disservice to all the men and women who do the job.

2	"Baby Reindeer starts off like almost any other streaming true crime story does; with a compelling premise, flashy editing, and the promise of something greater. The story of Donny (Richard Gaad - playing a version of himself) and his stalker, Martha (Jessica Gunning) is by itself inherently interesting. But it's the auto-bigraphical, raw emotional exploration that Baby Reindeer becomes that I really fell enjoyed.It's a show that isn't afraid to ask tough and complicated questions, and come up with uneasy and often taboo answers. It's a show that reminds you why the long form nature of miniseries is quite possibly the best way to explore people and their complicated interior and exterior lives. It's a show buoyed by fantastic editing, performances, and writing.Richard Gaad is truly remarkable in this show, in what becomes an increasingly difficult watch as it goes on, knowing that a lot of this stuff is based on his own experiences. It's almost like sitting in on a therapy session and the show invites you to not just ""root"" for his character, but question him. Interrogate him. Hold him accountable. He certainly does and if self-deprecation isn't your thing, you'll most likely hate this show.Jessica Gunning represents the part of the show I think most people will enjoy more, the more conventional aspect of the story, and my God, does she deliver. Martha is a tour-de-force in this show; a perplexing, fascinating, and sometimes terrifying character who will immediately shut up any person who assumes that it's ""impossible"" for men to be abused. She herself is treated with a surprising level of empathy and care and her presence is everywhere in this show, even when she isn't on screen.I've seen some people complain that this show needed to be funnier, and I really disagree with that. It has the characteristically dry and sardonic humour associated with the United Kingdom; I think it's probably one of the best examples of how *different* British humour is from American humour. I also feel like that stand-up scenes brilliantly reflect that old adage: ""in the US, the audience laughs to help the comedian out. In the UK, the audience needs you to earn that laugh.""I do think the show suffers from some pacing issues, with it packing more than it needed to into the final episode to finish everything off. There are a lot of threads that I think could've been explored more and some questions that I wish we got some answers to, particularly regarding Martha.But, I can't deny that Baby Reindeer really evokes the feeling of a great auto-biographical novel put to screen. Even Donny's narration - something that typically doesn't work in film - really adds a lot of texture and context to everything we see. This is a series that needed it, and that's it's great to see that aspect of the story done well.Best Episode: Four. I mean, come on. It's a brilliantly done, incredibly powerful episode that really transforms the rest of the show.Worst Episode: Six. I just felt this one felt like a filler episode, and while cute, could've been a bit longer and given us more for the finale."	baby reindeer start like almost stream true crime story compel premise flashy edit promise something great story donny richard gaad play version stalker martha jessica gun inherently interest auto bigraphical raw emotional exploration baby reindeer become really fall enjoy show afraid ask tough complicate question come uneasy often taboo answer show remind long form nature miniserie quite possibly good way explore people complicate interior exterior live show buoy fantastic edit performance write richard gaad truly remarkable show become increasingly difficult watch go know lot stuff base experience almost like sit therapy session show invite root character question interrogate hold accountable certainly self deprecation thing likely hate show jessica gun represent part show think people enjoy conventional aspect story god deliver martha tour de force show perplex fascinate sometimes terrify character immediately shut person assume impossible man abuse treat surprise level empathy care presence everywhere show even screen see people complain show need funny really disagree characteristically dry sardonic humour associate unite kingdom think probably one good example different british humour american humour also feel like stand scene brilliantly reflect old adage us audience laugh help comedian uk audience need earn laugh think show suffer pace issue pack need final episode finish everything lot thread think could explore question wish get answer particularly regard martha deny baby reindeer really evoke feel great auto biographical novel put screen even donny narration something typically work film really add lot texture context everything see series need great see aspect story do well good episode four mean come brilliantly do incredibly powerful episode really transform rest show bad episode six feel one feel like filler episode cute could bite long give we finale

2	I have really been one of those who have watched Grey's Anatomy since its inception, watching year after year each new season, and it really does not disappoint me, they always manage to maintain the personal drama, medical drama, despite adding new characters one always achieves connection With the new ones, it has very rarely been achieved. This last season, manages to introduce a new group of residents with characteristics similar to the originals but each one with its own essence, making the viewer make a connection with them and their stories despite many of the original characters having already left, it also managed to bring old characters for example like Addison. This season covers many interesting topics, for example Alzheimer's disease, anxiety, fentanyl problematic, sexual education, safe abortion (a very important topic in this season closely associated with all the problems seen in the USA), problems with residency programs, sd of bourn out in health personnel, the poor salaries of residents and their terrible conditions, changes in medical teaching, teamwork. My least favorite and most annoying character is Simone, I think she is very selfish, Benson has a lot of potential but I would like to know more about her story, Jules reminds us of Izzie (but her character still needs a little more development), Lucas is the one who worked the most due to being a Shepard, the best new character is Yasuda with a very strong personality reminding us of Yang. Shonda always makes us afraid when there are airplane scenes and someone can't be missing who escapes from a wedding. The season finale reminds us of those old endings where you are left in shock since you didn't expect it, already wanting to see the new season, to find out what happened to the characters. Despite the years, Grey's Anatomy has much more to tell.	really one watch grey anatomy since inception watch year year new season really disappoint always manage maintain personal drama medical drama despite add new character one always achieve connection new one rarely achieve last season manage introduce new group resident characteristics similar original one essence make viewer make connection story despite many original character already leave also manage bring old character example like addison season cover many interest topic example alzheimer disease anxiety fentanyl problematic sexual education safe abortion important topic season closely associate problem see usa problem residency program sd bourn health personnel poor salary resident terrible condition change medical teach teamwork least favorite annoy character simone think selfish benson lot potential would like know story jule remind we izzie character still need little development lucas one work due shepard good new character yasuda strong personality remind us yang shonda always make we afraid airplane scene someone miss escape we d season finale remind we old end leave shock since expect already want see new season find happen character despite year grey anatomy much tell
0	"Being a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was excited to check out this new hyped up sci-fi series. It starts of really well and hooked me right away. The first few episodes build so much intrigue and speculation.Then the show grinds nearly to a halt. There is little to no story progression. We focus on ridiculously annoying subplots. I could feel myself caring less by the minute.The final few episodes ramp back up with more frequent major plot points, but it's too late. The show already lost me. And there are a bunch of things that don't really make sense. I don't think I'll be checking out season 2.(1 viewing, 4/15/2024)SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSThere are a few things that don't work or that I find hard to believe. For example, people who dedicate their life to science discover aliens, and their immediate reaction is, ""They are my Gods.""Then they do this thing where maybe the aliens aren't so bad, until a huge reveal of, ""you are bugs."" The problem is, they already told us from the beginning that the aliens will be bad for us. The pacifist alien says not to contact them or Earth will be conquered. They should have either left the possibility of peaceful aliens open until ""you are bugs."" Or stop acting like it's not already known by the audience.Then their is a mission to steal the communications with the aliens. They say they can't storm the boat with special forces because it will be a bloodbath and the passengers might destroy the data. And they can't use a missile strike or they might destroy the data themselves.So they come up with a plan to use nanofibers to destroy the boat. Which is a total bloodbath. Which also may have destroyed the data itself. Which also gives the passengers enough time to destroy the data. The fact that this idiotic plan succeeds is pure dumb luck.The annoying subplots I mentioned are the cancer patient and the love triangle he's a part of.

1	Baby Reindeer is one of the TV shows that came out of nowhere on Netflix, and certainly has created a buzz among the viewers. It is based on Richard Gadd's real-life experiences, and I think it could not be braver to make something like this and talk about important topics. This series is quite harrowing and deals with loads of subjects such as social anxieties, abuse, addiction, ideologies, and stalking. Jessica Cunningham is spectacular, and she deserves to get an Emmy nomination. Her chemistry with Richard Gadd is great. An off-beat aspect is often the mix-up and balance between the comedy and drama, which at times doesn't work as well considering how heavy-handed the subject is. It is hard to understand whether to laugh or cry. I guess both.	baby reindeer one tv show come nowhere netflix certainly create buzz among viewer base richard gadd real life experience think could braver make something like talk important topic series quite harrow deal load subject social anxiety abuse addiction ideologie stalk jessica cunningham spectacular deserve get emmy nomination chemistry richard gadd great beat aspect often mix balance comedy drama time work well consider heavy hand subject hard understand whether laugh cry guess
1	"Not the best show out there, but there are thousands of viewers out there whom I'm sure disagree.In my personal opinion I like ""House M.D."" better. In House, they don't know whats wrong with all the patients. In ""Grey's Anatomy"" they almost always know exactly what to do and how to fix it. But again, it depends on your taste. ""Grey's Anatomy"" puts a unique drama twist on the personal and professional lives of five surgical interns. My sister had me watch a few episodes and I thought ""Man this show is pretty good"".If your looking for a show with puzzles in which you must piece together along with the cast, I'd recommend ""House M.D."". If your looking for a drama that is more focused on the personal life of the characters, I'd say this title is for you, because ""Grey's Anatomy"" is sure to deliver."	good show thousand viewer sure disagree personal opinion like house better house know what s wrong patient grey anatomy almost always know exactly fix depend taste grey anatomy put unique drama twist personal professional live five surgical intern sister watch episode think man show pretty good look show puzzle must piece together along cast recommend house look drama focus personal life character say title grey anatomy sure deliver
2	I loved the 'Talented Mr Ripley' version, however, have enjoyed this just as much in a different way. I liked the fact that it didn't just try to copy the last version. I was a bit taken a back at the older Tom Ripley in this version but just decided that a longer time period had passed and got used to it.I thought the actor playing Tom was fabulous and also the different Marge was streets better than Gwyneth Paltrow whom I thought was the big weakness in the previous version.The black and white worked so well with this, more sinister, and moody version. Whilst the colour of the last version worked with the 'Talented' version which portrayed a much more extraverted and upbeat Dickie.The negative element for me this time was Dickie. There seemed to be nothing to like about him and he lacked any charisma at all. He was a bit wooden and sexless to be honest. Last time, you felt that Tom had fallen so in love with the Jude Law version that he could not bear to be rejected by him or live without him. This time, I just felt that Tom wanted to take over his lifestyle but had no feelings for him. So, I think this version has fewer layers to it and something was missing.Still, you just need to accept that this is a completely different version, and it is very watchable and intriguing. Certainly, the actor playing Tom IS the film. I think worth it just for his acting.	love talente mr ripley version however enjoy much different way like fact try copy last version bite take back old tom ripley version decide long time period pass get use think actor play tom fabulous also different marge street well gwyneth paltrow think big weakness previous version black white work well sinister moody version whilst colour last version work talente version portray much extraverte upbeat dickie negative element time dickie seem nothing like lack charisma bite wooden sexless honest last time feel tom fall love jude law version could bear reject live without time feel tom want take lifestyle feel think version few layer something miss still need accept completely different version watchable intrigue certainly actor play tom film think worth act
1	Amazing plot, quality dialogues, twists, acting, and best music ever for five seasons. Quality drop a little in 6th season, but still great season. 7th season not on pair with previous, but for me still a good season. Then came 8th season, a finale. The less I said the better. Ruined everything that was done before. Rushed, it was like watching on 8x. Dialogues were adopted for little kids to understand. 50% of storytelling which was important for 7 season, turn out to be irellevant, which made everything done before useless. Shame. It could be best series ever made.	amaze plot quality dialogue twist act good music ever five season quality drop little th season still great season th season pair previous still good season come th season finale less say well ruin everything do rush like watch x dialogue adopt little kid understand storytelle important season turn irellevant make everything do useless shame could good series ever make
2	When I first saw the promos for this show I thought ''not another ER copy!'' But from the first episode I was hooked. Sandra Oh's fabulous acting, Dempseys's face and great writing have done justice to ABC and the millions of viewers. Meredith Grey the star of the show may be slightly whiny not to mention that her ally mcbeal type voice overs always relate how she lost her mcdreamy to his adulterous wife but she seems reliable in a way that she is damaged and not perfect as many lead characters are. Shonda Rhimes has really managed to combine ER, SATC and Friends into one to create a show that is sure to be a future legend. However, the Shepherd marriage seems to have dragged on forever and really needs to end so as to please all the ''MerDer''fans. The love triangles seem to get more complex and exciting the more the show goes on leaving viewers on the edge of their sofas and wondering (and some wishing)as to what will happen next. Greys Anatomy has become my favourite TV show because it has really broken the ''medical'' genre barrier that is slightly ''done and dusted ''and explored other levels such as the pinnacle of a hospital, competition among colleagues and the love lives of doctors which are hard to roll into 43 minutes of viewing time. In lieu, Greys Anatomy is not just a typical medical drama but something more special, it is an entertaining show case which is captivating and funny. On the whole a ''dramedy''.	first see promos show think another er copy first episode hook sandra oh fabulous act dempsey face great write do justice abc million viewer meredith grey star show may slightly whiny mention ally mcbeal type voice over always relate lose mcdreamy adulterous wife seem reliable way damage perfect many lead character shonda rhime really manage combine er satc friend one create show sure future legend however shepherd marriage seem drag forever really need end please merder fan love triangle seem get complex excite show go leave viewer edge sofas wonder wish happen next grey anatomy become favourite tv show really break medical genre barrier slightly do dust explore level pinnacle hospital competition among colleague love live doctor hard roll minute view time lieu grey anatomy typical medical drama something special entertain show case captivate funny whole dramedy
2	"I'd seen The Talented Mr. Ripley long, long ago, so remembered a few things which took place within, but it's such a truly beautifully shot, visually stunning and a cinematographically perfect that I didn't mind seeing any of it again.Quite frankly it feels like such a totally different take on the source material so as to be more of a reimagining than a remake.Each shot seems like it was either effortlessly framed by an absolute genius or painstakingly planned by same said genius with OCD.Seriously, every single frame looks like it could be part of a coffee-table book of a masterclass on composition, framing, cinematography, timing, lighting, contrast, casting, writing, casting, editing, acting and delivery.I find myself often shaking my head in disbelief at how beautiful it all is, and actually feel guilty when I look away to answer a text or look up an actor's name and resume, only to realize I'd seen many before yet they were truly transforrned. I've always enjoyed Dakota Fanning's work, but she's so utterly believable in the role that I forgot it was her for a few episodes. The rest of the cast is so perfectly placed and even the minor characters shine brightly.If memory serves correctly, the Netflix, teaser mentions something about ""Visionary Director Steven Zaillian"", usually an inflated, narcissistic ass-kissing of some festival darling-du-jour, but this man has absolutely earned the adjective and his resume shows undeniable proof over and over.I do so hope there is more of this limited series or at least another project from Mr. Zaillian soon."	see talente mr ripley long long ago remember thing take place within truly beautifully shoot visually stun cinematographically perfect mind see quite frankly feel like totally different take source material reimagine remake shoot seem like either effortlessly frame absolute genius painstakingly plan say genius ocd seriously every single frame look like could part coffee table book masterclass composition frame cinematography time light contrast cast write cast edit act delivery find often shake head disbelief beautiful actually feel guilty look away answer text look actor name resume realize see many yet truly transforrne always enjoy dakota fan work utterly believable role forget episode rest cast perfectly place even minor character shine brightly memory serve correctly netflix teaser mention something visionary director steven zaillian usually inflate narcissistic ass kiss festival darling du jour man absolutely earn adjective resume show undeniable proof hope limit series least another project mr zaillian soon
0	And that´s that - the acting of Blackthorne is terrible, everytime he appears is horrible, it is cringeworthy. The japanese actors and actresses are great, the portuguese well...they could speak portuguese just like the japanese speak in their own language. I am watching just hoping Blackthorne dies soon.The setup, plot and storyline is quite good, but it is completely biassed so english appears to be good, and spanish and portuguese are the bad, when the real story is that piracy, dirty tricks etc have been always the trademark of the british. It is british propaganda on how good they are and how they rest of nations should be grateful that they are here.	act blackthorne terrible everytime appear horrible cringeworthy japanese actor actress great portuguese well could speak portuguese like japanese speak language watch hop blackthorne die soon setup plot storyline quite good completely bias english appear good spanish portuguese bad real story piracy dirty trick etc always trademark british british propaganda good rest nation grateful
0	So the series is finally over, and the last few episodes absolutely destroyed the legacy. The show averaged a 9.5 since season 1 until the end of season 8, now I just hope people remember to change their ratings to reflect the fact that this show is not deserving of a 10.It couldn't maintain a perfect storyline like Breaking Bad did, and I believe we owe it to future generations to not mislead them into thinking this is the best show on tv when it started great, but finished horribly	series finally last episode absolutely destroy legacy show average since season end season hope people remember change rat reflect fact show deserve maintain perfect storyline like break bad believe owe future generation mislead think good show tv start great finish horribly
1	There is a lot of adaptation, and the main characters are set together. The narrative omits some background introduction and exploration of the three-body game, so it also loses a lot of comedic conflict. But compared to other boring science fiction works at the moment, a remake of a classic science fiction novel is still worth spending half a day to watch. In my opinion, the main problem with this adaptation is that the conflict set in the original story has its historical and political roots, and these deep contents seem to be unsuitable after substituting the subject and the place of occurrence, which is difficult for a reader who is loyal to the original book to accept.	lot adaptation main character set together narrative omit background introduction exploration three body game also lose lot comedic conflict compare bore science fiction work moment remake classic science fiction novel still worth spend half day watch opinion main problem adaptation conflict set original story historical political root deep content seem unsuitable substitute subject place occurrence difficult reader loyal original book accept
0	This show had everything to be a great one, but putting someone speaking in english and calling it portuguese was the nail in the coffin for me.Portuguese is one of the most spoken languages in the world and they couldn't find someone that spoke the language?That's lazy and disrespectful to say the least.One of the main characters, Blackthorne, is also a terrible actor, he's a disgrace to the show, there are so many great actors that actually speak portuguese that could easily have done that role better than this awful guy.I'm disappointed with this and with the historical incorrectness too, Portugal never explored the Japanese, they were trading partners and friends, they should have read some books about it at least.Terrible!!!	show everything great one put someone speak english call portuguese nail coffin portuguese one speak language world find someone speak language lazy disrespectful say least one main character blackthorne also terrible actor disgrace show many great actor actually speak portuguese could easily do role well awful guy disappoint historical incorrectness portugal never explore japanese trade partner friend read book least terrible
1	The show was a surprise to me since I didn't hear nor read about it. The idea of the show, that it follows three rookies is also promising and should deliver content for a couple of seasons. However...By season 3 all rookies have become P2 which means the idea of the show has become obsolete.Almost no other cop has a speaking role and they're literal bystanders. In every scene the rookies behave like seasoned cops while the others just stand around and do nothing.In every case and murder scene and whatsoever, there's always the main cast coming as a backup. Like there's no other cop on town.There's shooting in every episode. And then they're all bad shooters. Hit rate is like 0.00000001% and then all of the sudden they hit with their very first shot.Nolan's love interest are getting more annoying with every season. In season 2 he starts to reconnect to his ex, a doctor in a hospital and every time the show goes into the hospital, she is there. Like there's no other doctor working there. But his girlfriend after her... she knocks the ball way out of the park. She is really everywhere and is annoying as hell. She is not only a firefighter but a Capoeira teacher, a dogsitter and even in the reserve. Like with his girls before, Bailey is everywhere and obviously the only firefighter around. The moment i saw her LEADING the military unit storming the premise though was the final straw.The amount of achievements the rookies manage to gain is ridiculous. By the end of season 2 they experienced and achieved so much, that they should all be promoted to Sergeants.Time is a concept the series doesn't take to serious. How fast they all get to the scene or can change their location... In season 4 Nolan and Tim met with an agent I think and she get's transported away by the CIA. 3 minutes later Nolan and Tim and a bunch of reinforcement set up a barricade to free the agent. And they're standing there expecting the CIA like in all calmness like they've been standing there for quite a while. How in the hell is that possible?Cases get solved way too fast and easily. The show would benefit from a main angle which goes through the whole season while solving cases in every episode. But further the main angle bit by bit.	show surprise since hear read idea show follow three rookie also promise deliver content couple season however season rookie become p mean idea show become obsolete almost cop speak role literal bystander every scene rookie behave like season cop other stand around nothing every case murder scene whatsoever always main cast come backup like cop town shoot every episode bad shooter hit rate like sudden hit first shoot nolan love interest get annoy every season season start reconnect ex doctor hospital every time show go hospital like doctor work girlfriend knock ball way park really everywhere annoy hell firefighter capoeira teacher dogsitter even reserve like girl bailey everywhere obviously firefighter around moment see lead military unit storm premise though final straw amount achievement rookie manage gain ridiculous end season experience achieve much promote sergeant time concept series take serious fast get scene change location season nolan tim meet agent think get transport away cia minute later nolan tim bunch reinforcement set barricade free agent stand expect cia like calmness like stand quite hell possible case get solve way fast easily show would benefit main angle go whole season solve case every episode main angle bite bite
0	The original story reveals the insignificance and ignorance of mankind. As the heroine of the first book, Ye Wenjie should be an independent and brave woman. Under the screenwriter's adaptation, she became a person who relied on having sex with men to obtain her own means. The adapted story does not reflect the reasons for her despair. Also, the flickering of the universe has completely divorced the original intention of the story. The new story omits much discussion of humans and science. Turning the whole story into a second-rate Netflix TV series.Original story was great and deep, now it's just a popcorn TV show. Really recommend those who like to think go buying a book and read it.	original story reveal insignificance ignorance mankind heroine first book ye wenjie independent brave woman screenwriter adaptation become person rely sex man obtain mean adapt story reflect reason despair also flicker universe completely divorce original intention story new story omit much discussion human science turn whole story second rate netflix tv series original story great deep popcorn tv show really recommend like think go buy book read

1	"Baby Reindeer.Having watched the lot I found this show very self-indulgent, there was perhaps several elements of catharsis in this, perhaps that's why it was written, but despite this many of the psychological insights are shallow, perhaps this again was entirely intentional.As the show developed Donny just presented no internal resources and seemed unable to manage nearly every situation effectively, the exaggerating and ramping up of the drama creating a dramatic impetus. We come to learn why he lacked any resilience in episode 4The camerawork was excellent with some strange angles and viewpoints telling us all was ""weird"". It was quite a flaw in the plot to not have gone to the police sooner but as this is a true story we have to go with itCome episode 4 we had Donny's backstory, and quite a revelation it was! The drama throughout this section is a little disingenuous, the narration says no, no and more no, but before us on the screen we see complicit yes. I was confused when we, the viewer, could see what Darrien was about from the start and so must have Donny! When you go into the lion's den you will surely be eaten by the lion. Whilst we had an array of compelling explanations, mainly the promise of fame, from a personal perspective none of them quite rang true.In episode 5 Donny infers it's all the police's fault but it was clear that only 6 months down the line did he identify his stalker comprehensively to the police, what can you expect!Overall, it was okay, it was as I say very self-indulgent, the story was compelling but Donny fails to internalise the part he has played in his own life, the ending was overly contrived and the whole thing lacked emotional intelligence. The best scene was in episode 6 with Donny's mother and father.At best this is a 6 outta 10, meaning patchy moments of brilliance interspaced with dross."	baby reindeer watch lot find show self indulgent perhaps several element catharsis perhaps write despite many psychological insight shallow perhaps entirely intentional show develop donny present internal resource seem unable manage nearly every situation effectively exaggerate ramp drama create dramatic impetus come learn lack resilience episode camerawork excellent strange angle viewpoint tell we weird quite flaw plot go police soon true story go itcome episode donny backstory quite revelation drama throughout section little disingenuous narration say us screen see complicit yes confuse viewer could see darrien start must donny go lion den surely eat lion whilst array compel explanation mainly promise fame personal perspective none quite ring true episode donny infer police fault clear month line identify stalker comprehensively police expect overall okay say self indulgent story compel donny fail internalise part play life end overly contrive whole thing lack emotional intelligence good scene episode donny mother father good outta mean patchy moment brilliance interspace dross

1	I would have given the show an 8 or 9 years ago, but the show has completely jumped the shark. Not only does the show seem to be spinning it's wheels with no clear direction anymore, but the introduction of Meredith's baby has destroyed the dynamic of the main character. There are now too many shows dedicated to the family aspect, and not medicine. This was a similar scenario to what happened on House MD. Sometimes, shows simply overstay their welcome on the air and try to come up with too many gimmicks and no new ideas, as Grey's clearly has. The new writers (in other words, the one who took over for Rimes), have ruined to show.	would give show year ago show completely jump shark show seem spin wheel clear direction anymore introduction meredith baby destroy dynamic main character many show dedicate family aspect medicine similar scenario happen house md sometimes show simply overstay welcome air try come many gimmick new idea grey clearly new writer word one take rim ruin show

This dull lackluster confabulation sucks the life out of a really great story by Patricia Highsmith. The B&W cinematography, while beautiful, is used like a series of photos in an album - static. And speaking of static, the acting... I'm a super fan of Andrew Scott. From his great subtly (Foyles War) to his great overacting (Sherlock Holmes) but even he couldn't find the way forward in the straight jacket he was jammed into by this screenplay and at the hands of this stilted director.I've now met the character limit required in order to post this and I'm done.	work tax clean house paint room tv well yet paint room one tv dull lackluster confabulation suck life really great story patricia highsmith b w cinematography beautiful use like series photo album static speak static act super fan andrew scott great subtly foyles war great overact sherlock holme even find way forward straight jacket jam screenplay hand stilte director meet character limit require order post do

1	The show was pretty interesting, with great characters and actually interesting plotlines. Though far from medically accurate, it was a good show. That is up until around season nine. Spoiler alert: everybody dies! Or leaves the show... or comes back later to visit another dead character in the afterlife... or gets traumatically injured.. or drowns for like an hour to then be magically revived and then go on and die again... you get the gist. Now, that said, I loved this show, I loved it until I realised how repetitive it was. It got boring for me. But by all means, watch it, it's great for a while. Just not for the whole run of the show.

The dialogue is incredibly poorly written that it is difficult to seriously believe that this ""motley"" crew of mega smart Mary Sues and Beta Males have even known each other for more than 3 days, let alone for many years.The series had enormous potential, but this was in no way exploitedA few scenes were still pretty cool though, like the ""boat meets nanofibers"" scene was very or basically any scene in which Tatiana appears.By the way: The way ""intelligent"" people or scientists are portrayed here is almost childishly stupid.As if ""intelligent"" people are constantly quoting some great historical figure, constantly babbling about their own ""intellect"", or immediately emphasizing their leadership role in XY in the first 30 seconds of a conversation.Idiotic."	waste honest even really know start possible make complete mistake cast actor charisma depth nothing lot blah blah without substance spoiler alert find bad far role sick friend one hand dude absolutely bad actor good case amateur place netflix production hand scene guy far long wind completely uninteresting course story thing get interest second follow another endless amount pointless sit around talk character incredibly bore arrogant narcissistic without social skill dialogue incredibly poorly write difficult seriously believe motley crew mega smart mary sue beta male even know day let alone many year series enormous potential way exploiteda scene still pretty cool though like boat meet nanofiber scene basically scene tatiana appear way way intelligent people scientist portray almost childishly stupid intelligent people constantly quote great historical figure constantly babble intellect immediately emphasize leadership role xy first second conversation idiotic

No silly feminist politics just great action scenes and wide eyed wonder and bewilderment at what she was seeing and finding out.Give this show a try.Very entertaining.	never play fallout game hear new nothing content go series blind maybe good way enjoy maybe miss little reference game look delve lore tv show honestly say impress colour feel story top notch tone act walton goggin mean perfectly cast ghoul cooper duality character brilliant ella purnell also superb role silly feminist politic great action scene wide eye wonder bewilderment see find give show try entertain
1	To write my thoughts about this new Netflix series risks suffering the wrath of several friends who are huge fans of the original sci-fi novels. But alas, I love to share even if no one cares.I had such high hopes for this show and wanted to love it, but ultimately, I was pretty disappointed. I've not read the books, so can't attest to how faithful it is, but it felt like huge chunks were missing and I was forever trying to figure out WTH was going on. It's really uneven and not very engagingly written, and while the CGI is excellent and the cast ridiculously attractive (for physicists!), the pacing is slow and undetermined. The science was really interesting and I was constantly looking stuff up on Wikipedia, but by the end, I was more frustrated than anything else and will have to wait until the next season for more (perhaps).	write thought new netflix series risk suffer wrath several friend huge fan original sci fi novel alas love share even one care high hop show want love ultimately pretty disappoint read book attest faithful feel like huge chunk miss forever try figure wth go really uneven engagingly write cgi excellent cast ridiculously attractive physicist pace slow undetermined science really interest constantly look stuff wikipedia end frustrate anything else wait next season perhaps
0	"Reviewing a video game adaptation presents challenges. Because they are (except for Halo apparently) intended to honor the fandom and the original game. This series does that, to a degree.The set designs, CGI (except for the Gulp monsters), and production quality are all very good. And who doesn't enjoy a good old villain performance by Walton Goggins? He's great.Ella Purnell, despite the fact that she's saddled with a Mary Sue role, is also very good, projecting just enough ""fish out of water"" humor and surviving by the skin of her teeth as central character Lucy. Her standard response says it all, ""Okey Dokey"".Unfortunately, aside from those two there are many miscast ineffective performers, led by Aaron Moten as Maximus the renegade ""knight"" and Moises Arias as Norman, Lucy's brother. There are several small bit parts that are well done, but they are few and far between.The writing? All over the place. A lot of the overarching story does come from the game, but there are enough bizarre and gratuitous plot lines that by the end of the sixth episode it all begins to fall apart. The tonal shifts between overheated melodrama (the fifties flashbacks) to the hokey spoof of life in the vaults, to the Uber violent present day quests through the badlands on the surface do not serve the viewer well.Because they handle their roles well, the episodes that feature Lucy (Purnell) and The Ghoul (Goggins) can be fun to watch, until gratuitous weird crap starts happening. But Maximus' story is harder to watch until he joins up with Lucy, because Moten is so bad that it takes the viewer out of the story every time. His story is also so close to John Boyega's (as a defecting Storm Trooper in The Force Awakens) that his performance suffers in the comparison. He takes himself so seriously, and his expression changes so seldom, that it doesn't mesh with anything going on around him.Then there are the frequent plot problems (the all powerful knight suit can be deactivated by anyone who unscrews the battery/fusion core from the back of the suit.

0	There is no value in portraying senseless gratuitous gory scenes of people suffering. It does not serve anyone, does not improve anyone's life, it just creates distress in anyone seeing it. We are empathetic beings and it is not normal to enjoy the suffering of others, in fact it can cause great distress in many people. I did not watch game of thrones for that very reason. Nor Braveheart. I stopped watching the walking dead when it went too far. I don't care how wonderful people may think the story is in this, so long as they decide it's appropriate to include stuff that I would not show to any child, then the show is surplus to requirements. Producers of these kinds of shows need to develop a sense of decency.	value portray senseless gratuitous gory scene people suffer serve anyone improve anyone life create distress anyone see empathetic be normal enjoy suffer other fact cause great distress many people watch game throne reason braveheart stop watch walk dead go far care wonderful people may think story long decide appropriate include stuff would show child show surplus requirement producer kind show need develop sense decency
1	I'm a latecomer to this program and only recently started watching it, so i'm reviewing at about 6 seasons in. Overall its a pretty easy going watch, there's good overarching character development and the individual episode medical plots are good and interesting. Engaging in the stories of each of the cast members is what makes this show watchable and makes up for its biggest flaw...the title character: Meredith Grey.Okay, the pseudo-philosophical intros into every episode are incredibly corny and irritating (probably not so bad if you're not watching a few at a time). But the main character, I can only assume was a massive mis-casting error they realised too late in the day, and just had to roll with it. The character is supposed to be 'dark and twisty', which we can all be forgiven for not realising because the actor plays her as complex as a plank of wood. But don't worry, the other characters make sure to remind us of this in pretty much every episode! She is supposed to be somehow pathologically troubled, but just comes across as an obnoxious brat who is just 'me me me' all the while making just idiotic, selfish decisions. She doesn't need to be likeable, just believable! Apparently she's supposed to be a brilliant surgeon, but that never comes across either. I spend the whole time thinking if she was cast differently this show would be 10 times betterSorry for the rant but she ruins the show in my opinion. The rest of the cast are brilliant, Sandra Oh in particular (effortlessly portrays much of what the main character should have), and everyone else are totally believable and draw you in. Still hoping she will grow on me...Despite the main character, she is not always the main focus, so much of the program is really enjoyable. And it is worth watching if you need an new comfort binge. Would have given 8 stars if the main character was actually convincing.	latecomer program recently start watch review season overall pretty easy go watch good overarch character development individual episode medical plot good interest engage story cast member make show watchable make big flaw title character meredith grey okay pseudo philosophical intro every episode incredibly corny irritate probably bad watch time main character assume massive mis cast error realise late day roll character suppose dark twisty forgive realise actor play complex plank wood worry character make sure remind we pretty much every episode suppose somehow pathologically trouble come across obnoxious brat make idiotic selfish decision need likeable believable apparently suppose brilliant surgeon never come across either spend whole time think cast differently show would time bettersorry rant ruin show opinion rest cast brilliant sandra oh particular effortlessly portray much main character everyone else totally believable draw still hop grow despite main character always main focus much program really enjoyable worth watch need new comfort binge would give star main character actually convince

Some of that is fine, but if a police series which shows mostly amazing und unbiased officers then pushes for those officers to ""push for change"" and somehow feel ashamed for beeing police... and then ofcourse you have characters like FBI trainee Simone in the later 4. Season. Absolutly annoying, doesnt follow orders given and does not present in a manner appropriate for an FBI Trainee, but gets empowered to heaven and gets an artificially boosted part in solving the case.

0	When The Rookie was announced, I was very excited. I have loved Nathan Fillion's work for more than a decade, and always give his new shows a chance. Unfortunately, even Nathan Fillion cannot save this show from what it is - an irresponsible, idealistic portrayal of the LAPD that entirely ignores the issue of police misconduct.In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that I have spent the last three years studying law, with an emphasis on law enforcement practices. I have worked or volunteered for civil rights groups in Los Angeles, including ones that regularly sue LA law enforcement agencies.From my perspective, there are two themes that are repeatedly emphasized during The Rookie. First, police officers have a demanding job. Second, police officers rarely engage in misconduct.With respect to the first theme, it is without a doubt true that police officers have a difficult job. They regularly deal with dangerous criminals and put their lives on the line for their cities. Not only do they face dangerous situations on a daily basis, police officers have received a great deal of negative publicity over the past several years, meaning that their presence is rarely welcome in the communities they serve.With respect to the second theme, however, the complete lack of misconduct presented by the show is fantasy. At its most edgy, The Rookie presents its characters as having to make tough calls under tough circumstances, and in each case their choices are justified. This is in stark contrast to the well documented fact that LA law enforcement - including the LAPD and the LA Sheriff's Department - regularly and systematically engage in serious misconduct. Episode 11's portrayal as officers always being able to inform suspects of the basis for 'probable cause' or 'reasonable suspicion' is out of step with reality. Police officers in LA regularly engage in activity that violates the 4th Amendment, such as unreasonable stops and seizures.Even more troubling, the LAPD regularly engages in the use of excessive force, which sometimes results in the unnecessary deaths of innocent people. Sometimes, these unlawful killings are video recorded. For example, here is bodycam footage of LAPD officers escalating a situation with an unarmed homeless man, whom they did not have probable cause to suspect of a crime, before holding him down and shooting him six times. Ultimately, my disappointment with The Rookie is this. Despite the fact that it has a terrific cast and interesting characters, it utterly fails to deal with issues of police misconduct. Instead, it presents the police as nearly infallible officers of the law, who operate in a way that requires no reform. The show has the resources to tackle these issues in an insightful way, but the writers have instead sycophantically catered to an audience composed of officers who do not want to change.	rookie announce excite love nathan fillion work decade always give new show chance unfortunately even nathan fillion save show irresponsible idealistic portrayal lapd entirely ignore issue police misconduct interest full disclosure mention spend last three year study law emphasis law enforcement practice work volunteer civil right group los angeles include one regularly sue la law enforcement agency perspective two theme repeatedly emphasize rookie first police officer demand job second police officer rarely engage misconduct respect first theme without doubt true police officer difficult job regularly deal dangerous criminal put live line city face dangerous situation daily basis police officer receive great deal negative publicity past several year mean presence rarely welcome community serve respect second theme however complete lack misconduct present show fantasy edgy rookie present character make tough call tough circumstance case choice justify stark contrast well document fact la law enforcement include lapd la sheriff department regularly systematically engage serious misconduct episode portrayal officer always able inform suspect basis probable cause reasonable suspicion step reality police officer la regularly engage activity violate th amendment unreasonable stop seizure even trouble lapd regularly engage use excessive force sometimes result unnecessary death innocent people sometimes unlawful kill video record example bodycam footage lapd officer escalate situation unarm homeless man probable cause suspect crime hold shoot six time ultimately disappointment rookie despite fact terrific cast interest character utterly fail deal issue police misconduct instead present police nearly infallible officer law operate way require reform show resource tackle issue insightful way writer instead sycophantically cater audience compose officer want change
1	This show started so good.Interesting plot with a older man finishing police academy and joining the force and his days as a rookie.There are some great characters here, Nolan itself, an ultimate good guy, Nyla , a bad ass detective, Bradford, tough but fair T. O. There are also some great and interesting episodes and some genuine humor (because the show sometimes doesn't take itself serously.But, after season one, everything went downhill - Bishop was out, Jackson was more annoying then usual, and some story arcs were just plain dumb - like Jackson and his new T. O. The show went from fun, to simply uninteresting.Not worth investing the time beyond season 2 in my opinion.	show start good interest plot old man finish police academy join force day rookie great character nolan ultimate good guy nyla bad ass detective bradford tough fair also great interest episode genuine humor show sometimes take serously season one everything go downhill bishop jackson annoy usual story arc plain dumb like jackson new show go fun simply unintereste worth invest time beyond season opinion

While watching, I can honestly say it was a good show full of emotions, comedy, great characters, and even engaging plot twists and cliffhangers. But, the later seasons, mainly seasons 14 through 19, were hard to watch. I did enjoy it, but it wasn't the same excitement I had when I first started the show; I think once the OG cast left, everything felt off and more like characters were replacing the ones that left.Overall, it's a good show, but don't feel obligated to finish every season. I've watched what I needed to, the fan favourites, and I probably won't watch anything after season 19."	grey anatomy show probably everyone watch list point watch honestly say good show full emotion comedy great character even engage plot twist cliffhanger later season mainly season hard watch enjoy excitement first start show think og cast leave everything feel like character replace one leave overall good show feel obligate finish every season watch need fan favourite probably watch anything season
0	"Being a dedicated fan of the genre, my anticipation for the release of ""Shogun"" was palpable. However, my enthusiasm quickly waned as I invested countless hours into watching the series, only to find it falling far short of expectations. First and foremost, the plot proved to be convoluted and poorly executed. Instead of a cohesive narrative that drew me in, I found myself grappling with numerous subplots that seemed to lead nowhere. The pacing was erratic, with episodes dragging on aimlessly without any meaningful development, only to hastily rush through important moments later on. Adding to my disappointment, the characters lacked depth and failed to resonate with me. They felt like shallow caricatures, devoid of any meaningful growth throughout the series. It was a challenge to empathize or form any connection with them, which significantly hindered my ability to invest in their journeys. Furthermore, the acting failed to elevate the material. Dialogue delivery came across as forced and unnatural, making it difficult to immerse myself in the story. It was evident that the actors struggled to breathe life into poorly written lines, resulting in performances that fell flat and failed to engage the audience. Moreover, the production quality left much to be desired. From the mediocre special effects to the uninspired cinematography, it was apparent that corners were cut in the production process. Scenes that were meant to be climactic fell short due to lackluster visual effects, ultimately leaving me underwhelmed and disappointed. In summary, ""Shogun"" was a glaring missed opportunity. With a more coherent plot, well-developed characters, stronger performances, and higher production values, it had the potential to be something truly special. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver on almost every level, leaving me with a sense of regret and the feeling that I had wasted my time investing in the series."	dedicate fan genre anticipation release shogun palpable however enthusiasm quickly wan invest countless hour watch series find fall far short expectation first foremost plot prove convolute poorly execute instead cohesive narrative draw find grapple numerous subplot seem lead nowhere pace erratic episode drag aimlessly without meaningful development hastily rush important moment later add disappointment character lack depth fail resonate feel like shallow caricature devoid meaningful growth throughout series challenge empathize form connection significantly hinder ability invest journey furthermore act fail elevate material dialogue delivery come across force unnatural make difficult immerse story evident actor struggle breathe life poorly write line result performance fall flat fail engage audience moreover production quality leave much desire mediocre special effect uninspired cinematography apparent corner cut production process scene mean climactic fall short due lackluster visual effect ultimately leave underwhelme disappoint summary shogun glare miss opportunity coherent plot well develop character strong performance high production value potential something truly special unfortunately fail deliver almost every level leave sense regret feel waste time invest series

2	As a long time fan of the original Fallout 1 and 2 as well as New Vegas I was a bit hesitant to how this should would be written as the narrative of the Bethesda adaptations never lived up to the heritage of the original Interplay games or the Obsidian/Black Isle New Vegas game with their amazing narratives - which in my opinion Fallout 3 and 4 never reached..I was happily surprised as I avoided any trailers and hype before I saw the first episode. The intro music from Fallout had me smiling and there was enough fan service to keep me smiling.I saw the entire series with my wife, who did not play the original games but she did play New Vegas, although she wasn't a fan the same as me. She did however enjoy the series once we got a few episodes into it. Of course I gave her a live commentary to the lore of the fallout universe and I can't say for sure how someone who with no additional information about the background story would enjoy this series. But hopefully that extra depth will just add to the enjoyment and if you are curious there are a lot of videos on youtube to give you a summary of the previous 200 years.I know there was some controversy about how some lore was potentially ignored from New Vegas. I'm not sure it holds, but even if it does I feel like it doesn't take much away from the enjoyment of this series for me.It still has the dark humor, the gore, the cynical world where there really aren't any good guys. And that is what makes this world so special. I think this was a really good adaption. The female lead is not the boring strong female character that has no faults and therefore no character arc. She develops in every episode. And so do the other characters. You get more backstory and by the end I was very excited for more.I think there was a good balance here to introduce the major traits of this world for new fans as well as old and now I care enough that I am also worried, because I haven't cared for a series since season 5 of game of throne ended.I hope they keep honoring the lore and spirit in which the Fallout universe was created. This is a great show in a time where such are few and far between. And unlike most things produced by Hollywood lately there was very little Message and preaching. The story delivered and that is what should always matter most. I hope more studios learn from this.	long time fan original fallout well new vegas bite hesitant would write narrative bethesda adaptation never live heritage original interplay game obsidian black isle new vegas game amaze narrative opinion fallout never reach happily surprise avoid trailer hype see first episode intro music fallout smile enough fan service keep smile see entire series wife play original game play new vegas although fan however enjoy series get episode course give live commentary lore fallout universe say sure someone additional information background story would enjoy series hopefully extra depth add enjoyment curious lot video youtube give summary previous year know controversy lore potentially ignore new vegas sure hold even feel like take much away enjoyment series still dark humor gore cynical world really good guy make world special think really good adaption female lead bear strong female character fault therefore character arc develop every episode character get backstory end excite think good balance introduce major trait world new fan well old care enough also worry care series since season game throne end hope keep honor lore spirit fallout universe create great show time far unlike thing produce hollywood lately little message preach story deliver always matter hope studio learn

I'm ok with sci-fi stuff and other-worldy mumbo-jumbo, but when the plot requires super smart people to do super stupid things like allowing themself to get dragged into a video game, but they are playing because ""it seems fun and interesting"" without understanding how harmful it can be to them or what it does or where it comes from or how it works but taking huge risks with ther head is ok to them and a no-brainer, and all of this in order for the show to play out at all, that i have a problem with.

2	Decades after a bitter young Chinese researcher hits the 'call button' on a massive interstellar transmitter, inexplicable data appears in our most sophisticated research facilities that implies that our understanding of physics is fatally-flawed, virtual-reality devices that are far beyond our technical abilities appear, and brilliant young scientists start killing themselves. I found the inaugural eight episodes of the series to be compelling viewing, with competent cast playing interesting (if not overly complex) characters, excellent special effects, and an intriguing story-line (note: I have yet to read the book(s) or watched the Chinese version of the story). The only real problem I have is with the near omniscience and omnipotence of the existential threat that is driving the plot - hopefully the writers won't 'paint themselves into a corner' and end up with a story full of 'but why...?' moments. I am definitely looking forward to season two.	decade bitter young chinese researcher hit call button massive interstellar transmitter inexplicable datum appear sophisticate research facility imply understand physics fatally flaw virtual reality device far beyond technical ability appear brilliant young scientist start kill find inaugural eight episode series compel view competent cast play interest overly complex character excellent special effect intrigue story line note yet read book watch chinese version story real problem near omniscience omnipotence existential threat drive plot hopefully writer paint corner end story full moment definitely look forward season two
1	"While ""Fallout"" had the potential to be an engaging series with its rich post-apocalyptic setting and intriguing plot, it is significantly marred by its over-reliance on graphic violence. The show's frequent and graphic depictions of violence often feel gratuitous, overshadowing the storyline and character development.The gore in ""Fallout"" is not just present; it is pervasive and at times extreme, making it difficult to watch for those who are sensitive to such content. This overemphasis on brutality can alienate viewers who might appreciate the narrative or the world-building aspects of the series. It's disappointing that the creators decided to lean so heavily into these elements, as the show could have been captivating without such intense and graphic scenes."	fallout potential engage series rich post apocalyptic set intrigue plot significantly mar reliance graphic violence show frequent graphic depiction violence often feel gratuitous overshadow storyline character development gore fallout present pervasive time extreme make difficult watch sensitive content overemphasis brutality alienate viewer might appreciate narrative world build aspect series disappoint creator decide lean heavily element show could captivate without intense graphic scene

1	"There's an awful lot to like here, both for hardcore fans of the games, and new or casual viewers.The visuals are absolutely spot on, with sets, costumes, props and many many Easter eggs all being taken directly from the games, right from the start where S. P. E. C. I. A. L. And skills are directly and cleverly referenced. The colour palette is more varied and the lighting is brighter, but this is a plus point: had it been shot in grimy, muted tones, it would have been jarring and anti-immersive.With a score either taken from, or influenced by, the games, there's nothing to complain about there either.The alternative-history of 2077 is equally well realised and convincing, although since it's filmed with the same palette as 2296, the flashback transitions aren't instantly obvious.Commendably, the showrunners don't shy away from the gore and gibs of the games, with some scenes verging on body horror. These are counterpoised with comic relief, and character drama, again consistent with the source. Most of the writing and dialog is solid, with some standout scenes: it takes a brave writer and director to have two main characters talk over each other with competing narratives, but it works here. There are a lot of characters and plotlines to juggle and interweave, but credit to the writers, they knit them together in the finale.The core cast is strong, with Ella Purnell in particular being wonderfully winning and convincing as the innocent-abroad Vault Dweller.However, there are significant flaws which have to be addressed.Finn - I mean, Maximus - is played competently by Aaron Moten, but he's far too old for the role. Ella Purnell is also 5 or 6 years beyond her part, but plays the ingénue more credibly, helped by those startling eyes.The treatment of Ghouls is wildly inconsistent. The writers can't make up their minds from one episode, or even one scene, to the next, whether they're near-indestructible superhumans or not. And this does matter because it would matter in-game.Sadly, the overarching plot for the season is a mystery box reveal which - as an original idea of CURRENT_YEAR Hollywood scriptwriters, aimed squarely at their own peers and the Modern Audience that they are convinced exists - is as infuriatingly farcical and ideologically driven as you'd imagine. It retcons an entirely new Fallout lore driven purely by virtue signalling from the most hypocritically enthusiastic beneficiaries of the very thing that the writers profess to eschew.Tragically, the final few scenes are simply an extended ""To be continued... question mark!"" montage. There's no conclusion here, just a tease that might be fulfilled in 3 or 4 years. Given the hectoring that was just delivered, and the lack of any firm premise about what future seasons might entail beyond more retconning flashbacks, this is a weak and insipid way to conclude what was shaping up to be a solid season. The writers simply ran out of ideas and punted the ball."	awful lot like hardcore fan game new casual viewer visual absolutely spot set costume prop many many easter egg take directly game right start p e c l skill directly cleverly reference colour palette vary light bright plus point shoot grimy mute tone would jar anti immersive score either take influence game nothing complain either alternative history equally well realise convince although since film palette flashback transition instantly obvious commendably showrunner shy away gore gibs game scene verge body horror counterpoise comic relief character drama consistent source write dialog solid standout scene take brave writer director two main character talk compete narrative work lot character plotline juggle interweave credit writer knit together finale core cast strong ella purnell particular wonderfully win convince innocent abroad vault dweller however significant flaw address finn mean maximus play competently aaron moten far old role ella purnell also year beyond part play ing nue credibly help startle eye treatment ghoul wildly inconsistent writer make mind one episode even one scene next whether near indestructible superhuman matter would matter game sadly overarch plot season mystery box reveal original idea current year hollywood scriptwriter aim squarely peer modern audience convince exist infuriatingly farcical ideologically drive imagine retcon entirely new fallout lore drive purely virtue signal hypocritically enthusiastic beneficiary thing writer profess eschew tragically final scene simply extend continue question mark montage conclusion tease might fulfil year give hector deliver lack firm premise future season might entail beyond retconne flashback weak insipid way conclude shape solid season writer simply run idea punt ball

0	"-Update- After watching the last episode, in which the screenwriter tramples on Clavell's original novel and its characters, I lowered my review one more star and propose a suggestion: Call the series ""A boring story about samurai."" Remove ""Shogun"" title because this is not Shogun. What a superb blunder yo made!I subscribed to this site after seeing that this adaptation of James Clavell's great novel has a score of 9 out of 10. In honor of this beloved author and his novel, which I enjoyed so much in my adolescence, I feel compelled to write this review and denounce the appalling screenplay and the complete neglect of the best moments of the story, entirely absent or distorted in this adaptation. The screenwriter took the main protagonist, a magnificent, astute, and brave character, and turned him into an insecure, cowardly, and somewhat stuttering stowaway. He took a politically astute genius with a noble heart like Toranaga and turned him into a spoiled child capable of striking a woman. In the process, he rejuvenated all the characters, who in the original story are at least twenty years older (I thought we had already overcome that disgrace of millennial productions, where we couldn't see old actors). The beautiful friendship that emerges between Toranaga and Blackthorne disappears. The intense love that develops between Blackthorne and Mariko vanishes. Mariko's best qualities fade away as they portray her as a warrior, slightly attracted to another woman? Of course! Because otherwise, it can't be a story of this era. What a sad era! To those who believe this adaptation is good, I suggest first and foremost reading the books or, alternatively, watching the 1980 adaptation starring Richard Chamberlain. Although there were cuts in that adaptation, as in any adaptation of a written work, at least the spirit of each character and the most important moments of the story were respected. In conclusion, a true missed opportunity, because this story deserved an update, an improvement in visual aesthetics (because the 1980 version looks very dated today). Perhaps a new version, in a few years, can accomplish what this one could not."	update watch last episode screenwriter trample clavell original novel character low review one star propose suggestion call series bore story samurai remove shogun title shogun superb blunder yo make subscribe site see adaptation jam clavell great novel score honor belove author novel enjoy much adolescence feel compel write review denounce appal screenplay complete neglect good moment story entirely absent distort adaptation screenwriter take main protagonist magnificent astute brave character turn insecure cowardly somewhat stutter stowaway take politically astute genius noble heart like toranaga turn spoil child capable strike woman process rejuvenate character original story least twenty year old think already overcome disgrace millennial production see old actor beautiful friendship emerge toranaga blackthorne disappear intense love develop blackthorne mariko vanish mariko good quality fade away portray warrior slightly attract another woman course otherwise story era sad era believe adaptation good suggest first foremost read book alternatively watch adaptation star richard chamberlain although cut adaptation adaptation write work least spirit character important moment story respect conclusion true miss opportunity story deserve update improvement visual aesthetic version look date today perhaps new version year accomplish one could
1	I like this kind of miovies and series. So I was very pleased these episodes scored very high on IMDb. So I had to watch it.For me, after watching the first three episodes, this is a no go. It looks very much like The Last samurai, although the Samurais are replaced by Shoguns. There is a white fellow who gets captured and learns the way of the Shogun. Similar story, stretched out over many episodes, does not have the heart and soul of The last samurai. But still manages to get a higher score. That's strange.So Hiroyuki Sanada has played in both as well; Shogun and The last samurai. But in Shogun he is the leader of his tribe and his part is played by someone else. Tom Cruis has been replaced by an other white guy and that's it.What disturbed me the most is that there is a lot of talking going on. During the talking, a younger man gets emotional and shares his anger in front of everyone. By doing so, he says that his bloodline will end. And so it happens that his ashes and the ashes of his baby ends up in two doggy bags for his wife. That did not make any sense. Cutting his thumb off would have been enough.	like kind miovie series please episode score high imdb watch watch first three episode go look much like last samurai although samurais replace shogun white fellow get capture learn way shogun similar story stretch many episode heart soul last samurai still manage get high score strange hiroyuki sanada play well shogun last samurai shogun leader tribe part play someone else tom cruis replace white guy disturb lot talk go talk young man get emotional share anger front everyone say bloodline end happen ash ash baby end two doggy bag wife make sense cut thumb would enough
0	Fallout is set in a clumsily put-together post-nuclear apocalypse world based on the computer game of the same name.While it boasts some impressive sets, the convoluted plot brings out mediocre at best from the actors who merely go through the motions of the drab storyline that is as bleak as the apocalyptic world itself.It appears that creating a TV series based on a popular computer game has become a common trend, similar to how computer games used to be developed from TV shows or movies. Honestly, they needn't have bothered; watching your kids playing the game over their shoulders is more entertaining. Unless you're a die-hard fan of the game, this is one to miss.	fallout set clumsily put together post nuclear apocalypse world base computer game name boast impressive set convolute plot bring mediocre good actor merely go motion drab storyline bleak apocalyptic world appear create tv series base popular computer game become common trend similar computer game use develop tv show movie honestly bother watch kid play game shoulder entertain unless die hard fan game one miss
0	"I see a lot of good reviews giving it 8/10, but I do not see much reason for praise. The show definitely has some interesting ""vibe"" to it, that people can like, for sure, and the style overall is not bad. But what about the story? Or maybe not so much the story, which is somewhat classical for a ""noir detective"" genre, but the narrative. It feels... Disjointed?

2	Baby reindeer was a good enough short series. It certainly held my attention and was never boring. But was often extremely maddening. The acting was excellent, however I had a problem with the two main characters. I found them both extremely unlikable. So as much as I found the show interesting, I had little sympathy or empathy for either.The show is evidently a true story, but hard to believe it happened exactly as filmed. Was Gadd as pathetic a comedian as shown? Was he as unbelievably stupid as shown? He never seemed to act in his own best interests, and allowed Martha to ruin what appeared to be a very promising relationship.Gadd did turn his life around in the end and prove to have some credibility and backbone.	baby reindeer good enough short series certainly hold attention never bear often extremely madden act excellent however problem two main character find extremely unlikable much find show interest little sympathy empathy either show evidently true story hard believe happen exactly film gadd pathetic comedian show unbelievably stupid show never seem act good interest allow martha ruin appear promise relationship gadd turn life around end prove credibility backbone
1	"Lol, I started watching this after checking all the reviews here and watching the ""making of"" trailer and, take this with a grain of salt because I haven't finished the first episode yet, but I think I already pointed out what the problem is, that got this series so many ""negative"" reviews talking about the exact same thing: it all stems from the ""bad"" move of having the real guy portray himself, with all his current age's glory of eye wrinkles and ""no longer spotless"" skin (which rest assured is something we share, so no offense, there...) when the events of the plot is all stuff that supposedly happened when he was much younger, wrinkle-less and spotless, and thus with a much more obvious ""naive-looking-resh bud- like"" appearance. From a visual standpoint, viewers unconsciously associate even the slightest presence of wrinkles with older age, and with life wisdom and experience... meaning that, from the get go, they won't expect an ""older looking"" person to act out the kind of naive mistakes the protagonist keeps committing when first talking to the ""stalker lady"", at the bar, in the very first episode (haven't seen the part with the male-to-male thing yet, so I'm obviously not making a reference to any of that, with this opinion...).Moreover, when in the ""making of"" the author, who portrays the protagonist, talks about the the bar where he used to work, with his randy coworkers, as an ""heteronormative"" place, it suddenly struck me that he is probably quoting his younger self: using the same words he used to describe it when he was closer to that age, meaning much younger... However, if you don't clarify it for the viewers that it's your ""younger self"" that you're quoting, there, then a ""mature-looking"" face like the one you have now will only encourage the audience to judge you; because they'd expect someone of ""your age"" to already know that, nowadays, most people wouldn't say those former coworkers of yours were throwing disgusting perv comments at you and your ""stalker lady"" because they were ""straight"" (or, ... ""heteronormative""...), BUT, merely because they were just garden-variety pervs, and pervs can come in all kinds of sexual orientation (as people would assume an ""older looking"" person to already know).All in all, what this series needed was a comical disclaimer (""this is me interpreting my much younger self, so please do as if you don't see my wrinkles"") or a much younger-looking authir portraying the main character."	lol start watch check review watch make trailer take grain salt finish first episode yet think already point problem get series many negative review talk exact thing stem bad move real guy portray current age glory eye wrinkle long spotless skin rest assure something share offense event plot stuff supposedly happen much young wrinkle less spotless thus much obvious naive look resh bud like appearance visual standpoint viewer unconsciously associate even slight presence wrinkle old age life wisdom experience mean get go expect old look person act kind naive mistake protagonist keep commit first talk stalker lady bar first episode see part male male thing yet obviously make reference opinion moreover make author portray protagonist talk bar use work randy coworker heteronormative place suddenly strike probably quote young self use word use describe close age mean much young however clarify viewer young self quote mature look face like one encourage audience judge expect someone age already know nowadays people say former coworker throw disgust perv comment stalker lady straight heteronormative merely garden variety pervs pervs come kind sexual orientation people would assume old look person already know series need comical disclaimer interpret much young self please see wrinkle much young look authir portray main character

1	Might be the most overrated show of all time. A glorified soap opera. I have only got to episode 9 and hope of something, anything besides endless dialogue, for something to happen. I have only given it a 5, because it is shot well. Beautiful scenery. Besides that, waist of time. And the mane guy isn't the best. His acting is as one dimensional as it gets. I truly don't understand the hype. Maybe is there was, I hate to say it, but a little bit of action? I love Japanese history and samurai's, but you never see them actually be samurai. Just walking around wearing swords, teasing is lol.

But so far I'm disappointed.It's a jumble of clichés that together spell ""Hollywood,"" and that's not a compliment.Various actors and actresses are absurdly good-looking. One of them, the Auggie character, plainly isn't a physics genius; people who are tend to radiate intelligence, whereas she radiates a combination of vapidness and eye candy.Every tenth word is an f-bomb. Tiresome and indicative of bad writing. Real people don't talk that way, unless their IQs are well below what's intended here.Everyone (figuratively speaking) is smoking. I feel bad for Eiza González being forced to smoke, possibly for product placement revenue purposes?

0	The cinematography is fantastic. And that's exactly where it ends.The writing is atrocious. Not a single line of good dialog. The action is trodding, bordering on non-existent. The acting is terrible (except for a briefly shown Italian postal worker). And unfortunately the direction doesn't make up for any of it. What a sad waste of a good concept and a good cinematographer's work.In the prior two movies, the Dickie character was vibrant and the Ripley character was curiously deceptive, but never-the-less likeable. The characters is this version fall completely flat. I found myself caring nothing about what they did next or what became of them. The butchering script and direction left me feeling as if someone had taken an oar to my head.And so I have bailed, never to return. What a shame.

Low humor highlighting artificially inflated stereotypes delivering insipid lines and juvenile one-liners.The shame of it all is that, instead of taking the opportunity to FIX the social problems they believe they are addressing, they compound them by thinking ""getting even with"", ""getting back at"" or trashing the people they target is a solution. (HINT: Treating people the way you DON'T want to be treated isn't how you solve the problem. It doesn't stop people from treating you badly. It gives them an excuse to treat you worse. - You lose ALL moral high ground. End of).But this show has kid-logic & does nothing to correct it.

2	I loved Minghella's film. It's glorious Technicolor and beautiful actors... However, I also really enjoyed the Ripley series - surprisingly funny, slowly building anxiety and making the audience confused as to why they're rooting for a despicable murderer/crook. I thought this is one of Andrew Scott's finest performances - where he was Ripley instead of Andrew Scott playing Ripley. I loved that Dickie and Marge were almost background characters - and the scene with Dickie talking about his painting and Ripley's reaction to the terrible art works is brilliant, the same with Marge's 'book' - very funny. The murders worked well in black and white and the production design was superb by adding texture to our visuals. The only weak link for me - a miscasting - was the character Freddie. It is impossible to play a role that Seymour Hoffman was magnificent on. Moreover, Instead of focusing on what Freddie was saying I was irritated by their voice and mannerisms - really distracted. The casting should be seamless - we should believe they are that person...this series is not theatre, with the theatrical suspension of disbelief.	love minghella film glorious technicolor beautiful actor however also really enjoy ripley series surprisingly funny slowly build anxiety make audience confuse root despicable murderer crook think one andrew scott fine performance ripley instead andrew scott play ripley love dickie marge almost background character scene dickie talk paint ripley reaction terrible art work brilliant marge book funny murder work well black white production design superb add texture visual weak link miscast character freddie impossible play role seymour hoffman magnificent moreover instead focus freddie say irritate voice mannerism really distract cast seamless believe person series theatre theatrical suspension disbelief
1	"The story is very catchy in the first two to three episodes. But in the later episodes the story roam arounds a very few people and becomes literally too much boring. It is even becoming unacceptable as apparently these 5 to 6 are the only ""heros"" who could save the earth 😂except the GoT characters, the other ""main"" characters acting seems boring and dragging the story unnecessarily. The series is unique in some terms, but the lazy screenplay sometimes makes it unwatchable.Giving the five stars just because of the exciting first three episodes.

1	This show was so great, but since a couple seasons, it decreased in quality. It's not the same show that I fall in love with. What happened to Karev that seems to be fading away? He was one of the most interesting out there, but now seems not having much to do. How can Grey, the main character, been divided for such uninteresting boyhood characters like Link and Deluca? I can't seem to like any of Grey's sisters, as well as Jo. They are all full of drama, but they don't make me believe or care. Still hoping the series to improve.	show great since couple season decrease quality show fall love happen karev seem fade away one interest seem much grey main character divide uninteresting boyhood character like link deluca seem like grey sister well jo full drama make believe care still hop series improve

And the portray of each characters, both acting and directing-wsie (especially Wenjie Ye, such a in-depth, complex and interesting character yet in here is just SHALLOW and PALE ) is SO BAD that I don't think they understand the core and complexity of this book. And all those political correctness is way too forced, after all, I think they just don't believe a true great story has universal attraction, despite the background or the origin of the story, so they put all those hollywood cliche adaptions in it expecting us to like it, SO WRONG!	story book already great enough see need much tasteless change portray character act direct wsie especially wenjie ye depth complex interest character yet shallow pale bad think understand core complexity book political correctness way force think believe true great story universal attraction despite background origin story put hollywood cliche adaption expect we like wrong
2	Greys Anatomy used to be one of my favorite shows and I still care about a couple of characters remaining (Weber and Bailey)But the writing was off these last few years, with Karev having one of the worst exits I've ever seen for a legacy character.So, the first decade, EXCELLENT. Years 11-15, still good.But around fifteen the story felt off, some faves had left, and they added a character I absolutely despised. (Sorry, Link, you bother me.)I just tried to do a binge of season 19, hearing they were basically doing a reboot midstream. Sounded like a plan.Instead, I got the confusion of new kids ranging in age by decades.Story lines rapidly shifting by telling not showing.People out of character completely.I had to stop.It might work out. And I might return later with more patience.But Greys season one grabbed me with the mix of soapy romance and medical stories. Season nineteen's new people?

2	Working to research the historical accuracy of this story however, it has been extraordinary so far. The emotion captured through the attention to detail keeps you locked-in. This atypical viewpoint on religion elicits convicting thoughts and is a sober orientation for audience to a time where law, sovereignty, and self-interest were approached in a more primal and, perhaps, barbaric manner. Furthermore, this story shines light on just how domesticated the Catholics in Japan were. Grasp of the language, hair and clothing, and peculiar cultural norms are clearly adopted and practiced by the colonial Christians.I will be supplementing this as I learn more-excited to see this unfold!	work research historical accuracy story however extraordinary far emotion capture attention detail keep lock atypical viewpoint religion elicit convict thought sober orientation audience time law sovereignty self interest approach primal perhaps barbaric manner furthermore story shin light domesticate catholic japan grasp language hair clothe peculiar cultural norm clearly adopt practice colonial christians supplement learn excite see unfold

It only distracts from what is already a brilliant story.I wasn't holding out much hope for this. In a time when remakes have failed over and over, it wasn't surprising that this would be the same. Can we please leave the classics alone now?! The only redeeming feature is Andrew Scott who is generally fantastic in everything he does anyway so no shock there.Just watch the movie and save yourself some time...	episode want jump tall build slow bore earth film black white try hard artistic completely unnecessary distract already brilliant story hold much hope time remake fail surprise would please leave classic alone redeem feature andrew scott generally fantastic everything anyway shock watch movie save time

0	The dynamic duo is back at it again, relentlessly ruining another great book with incredible stories. They have undoubtedly demonstrated that they possess nothing more than sheer luck, much like how they utterly decimated the last three seasons of the widely acclaimed Game of Thrones series. Disappointingly, they are once again treading down the same path of destruction. I must admit, I had harbored high hopes and expectations upon learning that this endeavor was backed by the esteemed HBO network. However, to my utter dismay, the production quality is appallingly low, the acting performances are cringe-worthy and devoid of any genuine emotion, and the overall atmosphere fails to captivate or immerse the viewer. It is a truly disheartening experience to witness such a promising project being marred by subpar execution, leaving one to question the reasoning behind entrusting such a cherished literary work to individuals who have consistently proven their inability to translate source material into a compelling visual representation.	dynamic duo back relentlessly ruin another great book incredible story undoubtedly demonstrate possess nothing sheer luck much like utterly decimate last three season widely acclaim game throne series disappointingly tread path destruction must admit harbor high hop expectation upon learn endeavor back esteem hbo network however utter dismay production quality appallingly low act performance cringe worthy devoid genuine emotion overall atmosphere fail captivate immerse viewer truly dishearten experience witness promise project mar subpar execution leave one question reason behind entrust cherish literary work individual consistently prove inability translate source material compel visual representation

It doesn't take the fallout world seriously. I felt like I was watching a comedy show halfway through the episode.The actors and actresses are very annoying and the series overall just feels very unpolished.This should be enough for you not to waste your time on this series.

1	A lot of people will tell you that Game of Thrones is an epic high fantasy series, unmatched in production power and acting, as well as casting and writing. And this used to be true. GoT used to be one of the best shows the world had ever seen. Complex, interesting characters and plotlines in a rich, detailed world. It used to for around five seasons.This show has changed and while I didn't mind (even as season seven became downright ridiculous), I didn't mind for a reason.Game of Thrones had the chance to reveal something deep, something meaningful and humble about the world we live in, about power and about sacrifice. The way it was crafted was designed to climax in a finale that would hold a revelation inside. Something to take away.Now, as the last season airs, this possibility has faded. It's spectacle and it looks as good as a few hundred million dollars can look on-screen. But the story it tells is not longer important. It has become the antithesis of what it opposed. Generic high-action fantasy. I highly encourage everyone to watch the first few seasons of this show, they are some of the best television ever made, including some of the best performances of our time. And if you have seen them, you will want to see the last three seasons too. And at first, you will notice small things, but they don't matter that much. But these things eventually become big and blatant and the question the books may answer in the end? They don't matter.I have seen more complex Youtube videos theorizing about this show becasue, early on, you could do that. Little things meant a lot and details would become major themes. You can still do this now, but the fact of it is, that the writers don't put as many effort in the scripts as the people imagining the impossible. Most theories are based around the fact that this show used to be everything but generic. Everything could happen. Now, it has become generic. And things just... kinda happen. It hurts to rate something this way that used to be better than the most. But we have been spoiled with good TV in the last years and GoT doesn't compare to things like Breaking Bad anymore. Even though I wish it did.	lot people tell game throne epic high fantasy series unmatched production power act well cast write use true get use one good show world ever see complex interest character plotline rich detail world use around five season show change mind even season seven become downright ridiculous mind reason game throne chance reveal something deep something meaningful humble world live power sacrifice way craft design climax finale would hold revelation inside something take away last season air possibility fade spectacle look good hundred million dollar look screen story tell long important become antithesis oppose generic high action fantasy highly encourage everyone watch first season show good television ever make include good performance time see want see last three season first notice small thing matter much thing eventually become big blatant question book may answer end matter see complex youtube video theorize show becasue early could little thing mean lot detail would become major theme still fact writer put many effort script people imagine impossible theory base around fact show use everything generic everything could happen become generic thing kinda happen hurt rate something way use well spoil good tv last year get compare thing like break bad anymore even though wish
0	"After watching Episode 10, I reduced the rating from 7 to 3. Why? Because the finale is just bad, so bad that it made me feel cheated. You have 9 episodes of build up, multiple scenes of large armies, all this talk about ""war war war"" and... nothing, not even a small flashback.When the finale began with a glimpse of an elderly anjin, I thought this would be a good flashback to the battle of Sekigahara. But it didn't capitalize. In fact, there was no reason to even bother with the elderly anjin.And what is the ultimately let down is that they didn't even follow the book. The show is called Shogun and they didn't bother to show you the ending in which he became shogun or show you what happened to Ishido. These were all in the book.Either they ran out of budget or for whatever reason, the finale seemed rushed and just overall one of the worst episodes ever and definitely one of the worse finales ever.-----------------With such high rating, you can be sure every review out there will tell you all the same positive things about this series that I can tell you. It is filmed crisp and beautifully with the newest technology and a very high budget production. The dialog is smart, deep, often with philosophy as well as wisdom. The actors are top notch and fit the realism and seriousness of the tone.But what many may have overlooked, especially the western audience, is just how ""comic book"" and cliche they portrayed ancient Japan. The one scene that completely throw me off the suspension of disbelief came early in episode 1 when a random NPC walked up to the prisoner aijin and asked a few questions. The ""leader"" of the village then just out of the blue decapitated him in front of the public.I get they're trying to portray an ancient Japan that was brutal, but that scene was so comical because of how out of touch it was with reality. For a better representation of how ancient Japan was, I recommend Yoji Yamada's famous samurai trilogy - The Twilight Samurai, The Devil's Claw, and Love & Honor. Even ""When the Last Sword was Drawn"" was more accurate and realistic in their presentation.The error in Shogun's portrayal comes from the fact the book was written by a westerner. It almost, I would say, demonized Japanese as if they were completely inhumane. This theme would progress into further episodes. Again, perhaps it is just how the westerners view the culture from their lenses.In Yoji Yamada's trilogy, it demonstrate that despite the culture, despite the code of the samurai, that they were still human, they still feared death and valued family, marriage, etc... In the movie ""Hari Kari - Death of a Samurai"" it showed how the most proud and arrogant samurai feared death and would hide themselves when their top knot was removed in order to wait for it to grow back than commit seppuku.For this, I would put Shogun at a 7/10. It is entertaining and it has a lot of great qualities. But for this one shortcoming, it just makes it really hard to take it seriously despite much of the element is actually based on a true story."	watch episode reduce rat finale bad bad make feel cheat episode build multiple scene large army talk war war war nothing even small flashback finale begin glimpse elderly anjin think would good flashback battle sekigahara capitalize fact reason even bother elderly anjin ultimately let even follow book show call shogun bother show end become shogun show happen ishido book either run budget whatever reason finale seem rush overall one bad episode ever definitely one bad finale ever high rat sure every review tell positive thing series tell film crisp beautifully new technology high budget production dialog smart deep often philosophy well wisdom actor top notch fit realism seriousness tone many may overlook especially western audience comic book cliche portray ancient japan one scene completely throw suspension disbelief come early episode random npc walk prisoner aijin ask question leader village blue decapitate front public get try portray ancient japan brutal scene comical touch reality well representation ancient japan recommend yoji yamada famous samurai trilogy twilight samurai devil claw love honor even last sword draw accurate realistic presentation error shogun portrayal come fact book write westerner almost would say demonize japanese completely inhumane theme would progress episode perhaps westerner view culture lense yoji yamada trilogy demonstrate despite culture despite code samurai still human still fear death value family marriage etc movie hari kari death samurai show proud arrogant samurai fear death would hide top knot remove order wait grow back commit seppuku would put shogun entertain lot great quality one shortcoming make really hard take seriously despite much element actually base true story
1	Starts good but then it falls apart.In first half of the season the supspense is growing but then it focuses more on the characters that are not so interesting to start with.In second part of the season, basically last 3 episodes, nothing makes any sense. And this is not for complexity but for the lack of any logic. The actions of the characters and the whole narrative becomes plain stupid in a manner that it is insulting inteligence.I was so annoyed that I stopped watching in the middle of the episode 7. Unfortunatelly, after a few days I continued watching.I have not seen a show with such contrast in quality in only 8 episodes, and I'm sorry I watched this.	start good fall apart first half season supspense grow focus character interest start second part season basically last episode nothing make sense complexity lack logic action character whole narrative become plain stupid manner insult inteligence annoy stop watch middle episode unfortunatelly day continue watch see show contrast quality episode sorry watch
1	"I really enjoyed the pilot ( 1st ) episode and gave it an 8. It became a downward spiral to a 5 at this point despite Hiroyuki Sanada trying to carry the series. He was amazing in The Last Samurai. Shogun failed completely to capture the nuances of Japanese culture that ""The Last Samurai"" perfecly did in a 2.5 hours movie. The writing has become terrible with useless subplots that don't really add up much other than as plot convenience/hole and shock factor.The cheesy long dialogues and quotes with the monotones are painful to hear. The worst element in Shogun is the language barrier where an unfit tryhard lead actor - Cosmos Jarvis - who needs a babysitter to make corny jokes between serious translations. If i was a Japanese, i would be insulted and ashamed as to how this series treats the Japanese language. Why would the series use cheap humor through a language barrier? How did this infantile, Cosmos Jarvis, even made through the audition?

2	I was expecting a typical lame series loosely based on the game, but I was surprised. It's just a really good series, even if you haven't played the games. To be clear, you don't have to be an F fan to like this, but ask your F friends about some of the background info. But, if you have played them, you will be pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of accurate game candy in it. So many incidental bits from the games, the little details like the random foods. Even a totally accurate power armor rack. This is a story that isn't in any of the games, but that's not a problem, it fits the universe just fine. One small bit I found somewhat strange the 3 interconnected vaults. All the vaults were independent in the games, but it's not that big of a stretch, and it is needed for the particular plot. I think what the overwhelming positive response to this really means is that Bethesda totally blew it abandoning what is arguably the top video game series ever done. F76 was a disaster, Starfield a total mess. Maybe they will find their way again and come out with a new game that really fits the Fallout universe. Hint - don't try to throw in every concept you ever heard of, but with a lame storyline. Starfield if you can't figure that out. Looking forward to the next season. And yes, I binged all 8 episodes in 2 days. Not sure why AZ chose to release them all at once, but thanks. OTOH, I'm already in withdrawal. Now if they would just add Cait in power armor, life would be great.	expect typical lame series loosely base game surprise really good series even play game clear f fan like ask f friend background info play pleasantly surprise lot accurate game candy many incidental bit game little detail like random food even totally accurate power armor rack story game problem fit universe fine one small bite find somewhat strange interconnect vault vault independent game big stretch need particular plot think overwhelm positive response really mean bethesda totally blow abandon arguably top video game series ever do f disaster starfield total mess maybe find way come new game really fit fallout universe hint try throw every concept ever hear lame storyline starfield figure look forward next season yes binge episode day sure az choose release thank otoh already withdrawal would add cait power armor life would great

Donny clearly has a Narcissistic PD and Martha has an Antisocial PD.I realised after that it was loosely based on the writer's life, I very much hope that he and ""Martha"" have received the professional help that they needed and are doing well now.I have to congratulate the writer of the review on here who expresses my thoughts so eloquently: ""Why are our human spirits being battered to pieces with a sledge-hammer by dramas like this"", they are totally relentless in their frequency and so highly prolific that it's so difficult to find anything that does not have this type of content. Of course I didn't have to watch it, it was my choice but I had to see it through due to my intertest in human behaviours and disorders.The two main actors who played Donny and Martha deserve Baftas. There was no weak link in this, everyone acted perfectly.However, as a senior mental health nurse working in a crisis team for 21 years I found it thoroughly depressing.I felt so much empathy for the main character, Donny, I felt so much empathy for the stalker, Martha too. When you're working with personalities both like Donny and Martha on a daily basis, and you've done everything in your power to help them but they continue to make life choices of self destruction, it's soul destroying.After wanting to change the world by being a nurse, I have learnt the long hard lesson that people can only be helped IF they want to help themselves, many do try very hard on a daily, hour by hour basis and succeed thankfully, but certainly not all.Donny started with Weed which generally always leads to darker paths and then stronger illicit substances, and I'm sure his mental health was impacted significantly by the heavy drug use and the after effects of that on the brain, as portrayed in the obsession with Martha after she was convicted, with the room covered in drawings of her and the obsession with the voice recordings etc.I'm absolutely sure that both Donny and Martha would have had many kind people come alongside them to try to help, and also interventions from mental health services etc.What really made me angry was when Donny went back to his abuser and didn't report him to the police, that just allows the abuser to continue and gives them license.The ending was equally as depressing as it was so true to life, negative and destructive behaviours just go on repeat.I actually wish I hadn't seen it, I'm off to watch Ricky Staniky again to cheer myself up!"	masterpiece act write storytelle two people personality disorder donny clearly narcissistic pd martha antisocial pd realise loosely base writer life much hope martha receive professional help need well congratulate writer review express thought eloquently human spirit batter piece sledge hammer drama like totally relentless frequency highly prolific difficult find anything type content course watch choice see due intert human behaviour disorder two main actor play donny martha deserve baftas weak link everyone act perfectly however senior mental health nurse work crisis team year find thoroughly depress feel much empathy main character donny feel much empathy stalker martha work personality like donny martha daily basis do everything power help continue make life choice self destruction soul destroy want change world nurse learn long hard lesson people help want help many try hard daily hour hour basis succeed thankfully certainly donny start weed generally always lead dark path strong illicit substance sure mental health impact significantly heavy drug use effect brain portray obsession martha convict room cover draw obsession voice record etc absolutely sure donny martha would many kind people come alongside try help also intervention mental health service etc really make angry donny go back abuser report police allow abuser continue give license end equally depress true life negative destructive behaviour go repeat actually wish see watch ricky staniky cheer
1	I'm leaving season 3 out of this review to focus on the good of the show. It's amazing. It's enjoyable, fairly realistic, and great casting. You root for the characters, you hate the characters, and then you grow to love those characters. Great story writing and storytelling, great execution, and in all honesty, it's almost a perfect show. Not a single bad episode. Except for season 3. It's.... pretty bad. It's not The Rookie in my eyes.	leave season review focus good show amaze enjoyable fairly realistic great cast root character hate character grow love character great story write storytelle great execution honesty almost perfect show single bad episode except season pretty bad rookie eye
2	This series is thought-provoking and an engaging series that combines elements of sci-fi, suspense, and character driven storytelling.The show explores themes of morality, identity, and the implications of aliens contact. With its complex plotlines, diverse characters, and unexpected twists, the season offers a compelling viewing experience.While some episodes may have pacing issues, plot holes and moments of predictability, overall, the series try to deliver a satisfying mix of entertainment and depth. Whether you are a fan of sci-fi or somewhat dramas, 3 body problem looks like it have something to offer!	series think provoke engage series combine element sci fi suspense character drive storytelling show explore theme morality identity implication alien contact complex plotline diverse character unexpected twist season offer compel view experience episode may pace issue plot hole moment predictability overall series try deliver satisfy mix entertainment depth whether fan sci fi somewhat drama body problem look like something offer
1	"The pacing of this series is so much better than the other version. The writers of this series have a better understanding of, ""get to the point"" than those from the other series. The nano wire scene with the ship in episode 5 was cool. I would say this version is way better than the other one. The other series was very difficult to sit through. The story dragged on and on and you had to sit through many episodes just to get a tiny bit of info. The game in this series was very short and to the point, but in the other series it was dragged out over many episodes.There are some absurd aspects to the story. Like why do these advanced aliens need earth? If they're so advanced why can't they just terraform a planet? Why do they accept a single individual as a representative of the entire planet?So far, I think this series is good. It is certainly more watchable than the previous version."	pace series much well version writer series well understand get point series nano wire scene ship episode cool would say version way well one series difficult sit story drag sit many episode get tiny bite info game series short point series drag many episode absurd aspect story like advance alien need earth advance terraform planet accept single individual representative entire planet far think series good certainly watchable previous version

The overall final goal of the movie was very underplayed and just felt like it was the final quest of the game.I know what you are thinking, it is a game and the game has a storyline. Well if this follows the game's storyline, then it is not a very good game.I expected so much more from the show all while it followed the game plot. There is as just no substance to the show really.The sets, customes, and acting here great. And it ended in what I would assume, to be the ending of the game. Solve the final puzzle, and bam!

1	"It's ok. Not great, but watchable. Considering it came from the maker of the abomination Rings of Poop, I was expecting it would be horrid. And Amazon made the garbage Wheel of Time show too. Amazon has a history of ruining established IPs. But Fallout was passable. The story was typical for the setting; anyone familiar with Fallout would recognize the standard plot. The characters were acceptable. I thought Ella Purnell was decent in the lead role and she wasn't a total girl boss. At least they tried to explain her combat skills. Her performance was a little flat at times, but passable. Aaron Moten was decent. I liked his character's arc, but his performance was sometimes unconvincing. Like Purnell it was a little flat. I wonder if this was more about directing than acting. Walton Goggins was excellent as The Ghoul, definitely the best character in the show. I'm a fan of Michael Emerson and would have liked to have seen more of his character. More Dogmeat please! None of the characters made me want to stick a fork in my eye when they came on screen, which was refreshing for modern ""entertainment."" There was a little identity politics sprinkled in, but minimal compared to most movies/shows and it did not distract from the story. I probably would not have noticed it if not for the in your face saturation that happens in most shows these days. The ending was weak and really drawn out. Showing something slowly doesn't make it more meaningful. It was ok, but not great."	ok great watchable consider come maker abomination ring poop expect would horrid amazon make garbage wheel time show amazon history ruin establish ips fallout passable story typical set anyone familiar fallout would recognize standard plot character acceptable think ella purnell decent lead role total girl boss least try explain combat skill performance little flat time passable aaron moten decent like character arc performance sometimes unconvincing like purnell little flat wonder direct act walton goggin excellent ghoul definitely good character show fan michael emerson would like see character dogmeat please none character make want stick fork eye come screen refresh modern entertainment little identity politic sprinkle minimal compare movie show distract story probably would notice face saturation happen show day end weak really draw show something slowly make meaningful ok great
0	The last couple seasons have been so focused on politics rather than story that it's become unbearable. There are good actors still on the show but it's understandable why so many great ones have left. The last season they seem to be wanting to try and restart the feeling of the show with the interns, it has a chance but if they keep focusing on politics more than story it's a waste of good new actors. It's also sad that they take character like Hunt and make him into a whiny baby to fit political narrative they are trying to push. I really wish Hollywood/writers would stick to storytelling as most of us want to watch tv to unwind from all the craziness and politics plaguing our country.	last couple season focus politic rather story become unbearable good actor still show understandable many great one leave last season seem want try restart feel show intern chance keep focus politic story waste good new actor also sad take character like hunt make whiny baby fit political narrative try push really wish hollywood writer would stick storytelle we want watch tv unwind craziness politics plague country
2	Everything has been said about how bad season 7 and 8 turned out to be. And I don't see how I can write more than that already been discussed but this interview when breaking bad ended always lasted with me. So here is what I think went wrong for GOT summed up perfectly by a show runners who actually cares about his show.Vince Gilligan( Breaking Bad creator) on how he wrote the show : People think of writing as dialogue and but to me writing is structured, dialogue is cherry on top. The real story telling is how structural it all feels like by connecting every character. Sometimes you think of a great scene, oh we really have a head on turtle and then have it blow off whatever but if you have to square pegs into round holes in order to get to that scene then you are doing it wrong. We questioned everything, we thought of every possibility but then we bet it against is it legitimate as to the characters forward momentum. We wanted to know where Walt's head at and we applied to it every other character. We had gotten attached to some big plan or some big set piece scene that we thought had to be there but the characters dint wanted to do what we wanted to do. As a show runners your story line don't mean anything if you don't know where your characters head at. There's very little of what we wanted, it was mostly of what would he do next. It was always step by step what in this position knowing what we know about this guy what is his next move. Balance of the show is taking him far enough, but not too far too fast.	everything say bad season turn see write already discuss interview break bad end always last think go wrong get sum perfectly show runner actually care show vince gilligan break bad creator write show people think write dialogue write structure dialogue cherry top real story tell structural feel like connect every character sometimes think great scene oh really head turtle blow whatever square peg round hole order get scene wrong question everything think every possibility bet legitimate character forward momentum want know walt head apply every character get attach big plan big set piece scene think character dint want want show runner story line mean anything know character head little want mostly would next always step step position know know guy next move balance show take far enough far fast
0	I only give this a 3 out of 10 because of one thing. I am SO sick of the politics outside of the show trumping the show itself. When Grey's first started, I ADORED it! I watched it every week. Then, this season, they moved it a different night, opposite CSI. I quit watching, figuring I'd buy the DVD. At this point, however, I really don't give a rat's behind if I ever watch it again. I'm really just sickened by how much rotten publicity an originally great show is getting - publicity that was generated by a stupid fight that cast members had and publicity caused them to fire one of the hugely main characters. There was no reason whatsoever for that fight to become as out in the open as it did. And now they're attacking Ellen Pompeo for something her boyfriend did years ago? Come on. Grow up and watch the show for the medical drama, not the lives of the actors and actresses on the show. I was a fan until all of this. I still think that the premise is wonderful. I still love McDreamy and Meredith together. However, when the plot began to be trumped by outside baloney, I gave up. I'm sure many others have too. Way to go gossip-mongers. Thanks for ruining one of the best shows on television.	give one thing sick politic outside show trump show grey first start adore watch every week season move different night opposite csi quit watch figure buy dvd point however really give rat behind ever watch really sicken much rotten publicity originally great show get publicity generate stupid fight cast member publicity cause fire one hugely main character reason whatsoever fight become open attack ellen pompeo something boyfriend year ago come grow watch show medical drama live actor actress show fan still think premise wonderful still love mcdreamy meredith together however plot begin trump outside baloney give sure many other way go gossip monger thank ruin one good show television
1	If you request to some extra terrestrial civilization to 'come on over and help yourself,' and then are seemingly surprised when they do just that, who's to blame? When you create nano fiber and then use quite possibly the most contrived reason to use it against a ship, who's to blame? When a physicist seemingly can't count to five while his buddy is performing confirmation before his voyage, who's to blame?This story is apparently based upon a book but I have a feeling that the 'DB Duo' have deviated from the source material once again through judicial use of coke or, even worse, the book this was based upon wasn't worth adapting in the first place and they weren't smart enough to realize it.	request extra terrestrial civilization come help seemingly surprise blame create nano fiber use quite possibly contrive reason use ship blame physicist seemingly count five buddy perform confirmation voyage blame story apparently base upon book feel db duo deviate source material judicial use coke even bad book base upon worth adapt first place smart enough realize
2	The first few episodes might not be too fast paced but it does get really good once the story line kicks in. I do not waste my time writing reviews for avg. Shows but this is way beyond avg. And I really hope Netflix continues with more seasons. Would be extremely annoying of them to stop it on season 1. Haven't read the books so no idea how it all ends but I am super curious to find out!!I can totally recommend the show to sci-fi lovers and I recommend to ignore the negative reviews especially the ones stating it's not realistic.... It's a show about an alien invasion... so of course it's not gonna be realistic.... Definitely touches some interesting ideas and is pretty original which IMO gets harder and harder as time passes on considering the plethora of choices we have nowadays.	first episode might fast pace get really good story line kick waste time write review avg show way beyond avg really hope netflix continue season would extremely annoy stop season read book idea end super curious find totally recommend show sci fi lover recommend ignore negative review especially one state realistic show alien invasion course go to realistic definitely touch interest idea pretty original imo get hard hard time pass consider plethora choice nowadays
2	"Excellent series depicting the complexities of abuse and the psychological processes that can happen during, especially in grooming instances. I think it shows so well how trauma bonding can happen, which can make it so much harder for victims to share or report abuse because they feel ashamed and partly guilty. It also shows well how people don't always react in the stereotypical fight/flight response (attack/run away/report) but can often ""fawn"" (people please, unconscious fear that acting out will make abuser more abusive or self-destructive).The main character might have unlikeable qualities at times and yes he might (like most human beings) crave attention at times, but to say that's why he is abused shows how ill conceived so many people are about the psychological processes that happen to many victims of abuse. Most victims never report abuse or take ages to report it."	excellent series depict complexity abuse psychological process happen especially groom instance think show well trauma bond happen make much hard victim share report abuse feel ashamed partly guilty also show well people always react stereotypical fight flight response attack run away report often fawn people please unconscious fear act make abuser abusive self destructive main character might unlikeable quality time yes might like human be crave attention time say abuse show ill conceive many people psychological process happen many victim abuse victim never report abuse take age report
0	Had several great seasons to enjoy and great actors and characters but now it's so boring. The new cast has overtaken the show and are pitifully boring and unfunny. There are a few of the original or older cast but they are barely used and now are filler. It's a whole new show and only has the weakened structure of the original show. This new show is called force feeding the masses in how and what to think and what to say or not say or else your a bad guy, girl, it, they, them, bbq pit, or any other delusional word you want to be called. If I get a thumbs down you know who I offended and triggered. I used to get emotional and feel for the character and story they imagined and now it's lost the thing that made it great. The cast makes a difference and the current ones just aren't connecting. I really don't think this show can recover and it's about time to put down the lame horse and put it out of its misery. It's lost the magic and is now a ruined show.	several great season enjoy great actor character bore new cast overtake show pitifully bear unfunny original old cast barely use filler whole new show weaken structure original show new show call force feed mass think say say else bad guy girl bbq pit delusional word want call get thumb know offend trigger use get emotional feel character story imagine lose thing make great cast make difference current one connect really think show recover time put lame horse put misery lose magic ruin show
1	"I know people love the show and I'm happy for them!I started my adventure with the series (Fallout 1 and 2) around the year 2000. The show, while going for the Bethesda esthetics, is quite close to the whimsical and satirical tone of the original games. I respect that.But it failed to involve me with its story. I like the characters, but the plot is a bit aimless, full of side quests and random characters (just like the games). So by capturing the games' vibes and esthetics very well, the show failed to capture my interest. I guess it's ironic that I was tired of it being so close to the games, but I'm looking for different stuff in games and shows. It winked too much, trying to say ""see, we get that!""...The casting is great and Walton Goggins is the highlight of the show. Lucy is lovely, but I couldn't care less about her story. Only her brother's plot got me interested, possibly because I like underdog characters and a bit of detective/mystery vibe (knowing the games I was aware where it was going, but still enjoyed it).So for me it was a fun time, but more like eating at a burger joint. Everything was fine, but it didn't blow my socks off.Still, I'm happy so many people love it :)"	know people love show happy start adventure series fallout around year show go bethesda esthetic quite close whimsical satirical tone original game respect fail involve story like character plot bite aimless full side quest random character like game capture game vibe esthetic well show fail capture interest guess ironic tire close game look different stuff game show wink much try say see get cast great walton goggin highlight show lucy lovely care less story brother plot get interest possibly like underdog character bite detective mystery vibe know game aware go still enjoy fun time like eat burger joint everything fine blow sock still happy many people love
2	This series really blows your mind. Starts out hitting hard and always surprises you. You fall in love with some characters, and loathe others. The depth of the story is very well thought out and it seems like there is a large purpose for what you are watching. Season 7 was short but amazing. It told a story of something that we all dreaded was coming, an ending. But low and behold, season 8 rushes in and destroys all hope for a well written finale to a story that has dedicated to staying true to the plot. So if you just now start watching this show, prepare yourself for a disappointing end. And even after people saying that we never should have expected a happy ending, that wasn't what we hoped for. I believe we hoped for an ending that would coincide with the rest of the story. Not something rushed and out of the blue.	series really blow mind start hit hard always surprise fall love character loathe other depth story well think seem like large purpose watch season short amaze tell story something dread come end low behold season rush destroy hope well write finale story dedicate stay true plot start watch show prepare disappoint end even people say never expect happy end hop believe hop end would coincide rest story something rush blue
1	Its beautiful and the set design and costumes are amazing.The Japanese actors do the best they can with the boring dialogue they are given.That's the only good things I can say about this. It does not deserve high ratings. Don't waste your time.Blackthorn is horribly cast - not the slightest bit believable as a tall Englishman nor physically different looking enough from the Portuguese to stand out to the Japanese as the reason why they let him live, unlike the novel. He is also a poor actor.And what is with the accent, or accents I should say as the actor cannot stick to one. Horrible. I could not believe he was a British actor. I'm English and I have never heard anyone sound like that including when acting in period pieces.	beautiful set design costume amaze japanese actor good bore dialogue give good thing say deserve high rat waste time blackthorn horribly cast slight bite believable tall englishman physically different look enough portuguese stand japanese reason let live unlike novel also poor actor accent accent say actor stick one horrible could believe british actor english never hear anyone sound like include act period piece
2	When the nominations roll again next year, I'd be willing to bet that the cinematographer wins. This is the most stunning looking production I've ever seen for a series like this. Just glorious! It is like looking wondering through a photography exhibit. I have a problem with the casting although I do think Andrew Scott is a fantastic actor. However, he and the co-stars are just too old for the characters if you are familiar at all with the original story. I love the cat!This is a very leisurely paced series and I know that many viewers will find it boring. I was fascinated by it and the episodes in which murders occur are highly suspenseful.	nomination roll next year will bet cinematographer win stun look production ever see series like glorious like look wonder photography exhibit problem cast although think andrew scott fantastic actor however co star old character familiar original story love cat leisurely pace series know many viewer find bore fascinate episode murder occur highly suspenseful
1	On the one hand we get someone who is so cunning and smart but then he and the other characters make stupid mistakes. Why would Dickie tell Tom he needs to leave when they're alone in the boat far from land? So, Dickie could be killed without Tom being seen as the murderer. And Tom moves a bloody body down the stairs with the head wound leaving blood all the way and is just lucky not to be seen? Why not wrap the head in a towel? And the police don't see Dickie's picture until the very end? How ridiculous is that?! I know it's critical that they don't but it stretches thin. I enjoyed seeing the Italian locales and hearing the language probably because I'm Italian and have visited Italy before.	one hand get someone cunne smart character make stupid mistake would dickie tell tom need leave alone boat far land dickie could kill without tom see murderer tom move bloody body stair head wind leave blood way lucky see wrap head towel police see dickie picture end ridiculous know critical stretch thin enjoy see italian locale hear language probably italian visit italy
2	"Is it the best TV show of all time? No, mainly because the denouement/final stages of the shows story arcs are too rushed.Compared to a show like Breaking Bad which has two phenomenal last seasons (with a few little bumps) Game of Thrones was ""Phoned-In"" by the producers/writers.For what it is worth, below is my overall rating of the TV show and a breakdown of each Season. As you can see in my opinion the show hits a crescendo with Season 4 and then unfortunately drops. In the latter seasons there are some incredible episodes and major spectacle but the show loses the run of itself due to rushed conclusion.

1	The Netflix adaptation has style, I'll give them that, but it lacks a cohesive storyline.Its almost as if the makers of the series expects their audience to have seen the original or at least know the plot, so as to fill in the narrative gaps themselves.Most of the characters choices, makes no sense without additional context from the original film which is massive letdown.Johnny Flynn and Dakota Fanning were fantastic as Dickie and Marge. However I didn't quite like the direction the showrunners went with Ripely's character.In the adaptation, he's portrayed as emotionally sterile, and his actions are those of a psychopath. The original plot depicts a complex character driven by self-preservation.The both will make an excellent double feature.	netflix adaptation style give lack cohesive storyline almost maker series expect audience see original least know plot fill narrative gap character choice make sense without additional context original film massive letdown johnny flynn dakota fan fantastic dickie marge however quite like direction showrunner go ripely character adaptation portray emotionally sterile action psychopath original plot depict complex character drive self preservation make excellent double feature
0	Let's start with my end coments first. It's a lot of baloney! After all the hype we heard about this new show, it seemed to be just up my sleeve. Unfortunately, although the scenery is good and lots of fighting between different types of people, it is not clear initially what this show is about. Probably one has to be a gameplayer to know which characters are evil, good or indifferent. Even after viewing all 8 episodes, I still don't have that answer. I presume in the game the player decides who is good or bad. It reminded me a lot of Westworld, though it is very different and not Westworld. But the people behind this series also produced Westworld. I expected a better show . . .	let start end coment first lot baloney hype hear new show seem sleeve unfortunately although scenery good lot fight different type people clear initially show probably one gameplayer know character evil good indifferent even view episode still answer presume game player decide good bad remind lot westworld though different westworld people behind series also produce westworld expect well show
2	Here the film craft is outstanding and the musical score is exceptional, really supportive.This is an effectively harrowing journey. About a high IQ psychopath and an average IQ victim. Most of the issues in this are caused by the irritatingly bad decisions made by the victim. At so many points he could have played his cards better and ended the troubles.We're presented with a bunch of faulty characters, much like some of us in the real world. We see so many films were the smart and sharp thinking protagonists blow us away with their intellectual prowess.Not here. The contrast between this film and the fore mentioned kinds of film is strong. Bumbling reactions to challenging situations make for an ever spinning tornado of turmoil in this series.I wish to feel sorry for the main character but can't because of his unbearable decision making. Perhaps this annoyance is amplified by the fact that real life can be tricky like this, and we relate the character to ourselves, when we also make poor decisions.	film craft outstanding musical score exceptional really supportive effectively harrow journey high iq psychopath average iq victim issue cause irritatingly bad decision make victim many point could play card well end trouble present bunch faulty character much like we real world see many film smart sharp think protagonist blow we away intellectual prowess contrast film fore mention kind film strong bumble reaction challenge situation make ever spin tornado turmoil series wish feel sorry main character unbearable decision make perhaps annoyance amplify fact real life tricky like relate character also make poor decision
2	First, if you like a bit of intelligent sci-fi, this is for you. I nearly skipped 3 Body Problem because the write-up and reviews suggested it was going to be awful. I am very pleased that I eventually jumped into this. Yes, it is TV that is mostly rooted in some hard science. But it's a TV programme about super advanced aliens on their way to conquer Earth. So, and like all sci-fi, you are going to have to suspend your disbelief. I saw one review moaning that 3 Body Problem was not realistic because there was a 30-something woman who was a Professor of physics. I actually know a 30-something woman who is a Professor of physics.Second, the cast is superb. There are some old and new faces, and not one of them dials it in. It's an ensemble of talent. I would like to see more of Marlo Kelly, she looks like someone who can play an evil psycho really well. John Bradley and Adrian Edmondson rock, of course.The location filming takes the cast all round the world, the only minor gripe is the CGI. When it is there, the CGI is cumbersome. But the locations, costumes and sets are great. The time needed to get to know the characters is not there, so some of the more emotive scenes don't resonate as much as they could. But for an eight episode season, that's a minor gripe.The story is quite complicated, and you do need to pay attention. The early episodes can be a little confusing as they jump around a bit. But all is explained and eventually makes sense. The second half of the season is more-or-less linear. I haven't read the books, so don't at all care if they are faithful to them. I just want to be entertained, and 3 Body Problem does just that.	first like bite intelligent sci fi nearly skip body problem write review suggest go awful please eventually jump yes tv mostly root hard science tv programme super advance alien way conquer earth like sci fi go suspend disbelief see one review moan body problem realistic something woman professor physics actually know something woman professor physics second cast superb old new face one dial ensemble talent would like see marlo kelly look like someone play evil psycho really well john bradley adrian edmondson rock course location film take cast round world minor gripe cgi cgi cumbersome location costume set great time need get know character emotive scene resonate much could eight episode season minor gripe story quite complicate need pay attention early episode little confuse jump around bite explain eventually make sense second half season less linear read book care faithful want entertain body problem

1	Fallout series is a cult game series. It's universe is build up upon 6 games. Has lot's of places, characters and stories. However, looks like dear producers and writers of Amazon Studios decided to only use 'the popularity' among these aspects. To make the show suitable for both long-time fans and newcomers, in their own views 'suitable', they mostly wrote it without a decent storytelling. Episodes 2, 4, 5 and 6 suffers from this very badly to be honest. They could have told this story in 4 episodes. Adding 4 more episodes only thin out the story's effectiveness. Other than these problems, it's a faithful adaption and a worthy continue for the Fallout universe.

Lol. Dumb.And Auggie's nano fibre is can be used for dangerous means as we have seen, but she will upload it to make open source so all cana recieve this weapon.? Really? Brilliant idea?Dumb A. FTHE WHOLE EPISODE is based on dumb ideas.Why would the world leaders waste nuclear weapons and resources for a plan to send a 'brain', without knowing how Santi will react to it, that is gonna happen 400 years later. ?They would rather accelarate their research.

1	1st main protagonist: male, griefing, whiteHis child: exceptionally bright and brave, mixed race for no reason except that's how it works today (compare e.g. The Last of Us)2nd main protagonist: jovial and resilient female, whiteFather figure: wise and kind, on his way out, whiteAll younger men: weak or intimated by life, whiteFirst villain: female, ethnically ambiguous3rd main protagonist: troubled past, has issues with anger, male, blackBest friend of 3rd protagonist: tough and sly, of ambiguous gender, LatinAlrighty, folks. This is really swell. Now that we've went through the mandatory checklist, let's get on with the story. To have as many random scenes as possible, we will split one narrative up into four, understood? We will make it fit later on in the editing room. Don't think of it as a conventional story, or four conventional stories for that matter. It's more like snapshots of that trademarked Fallout feeling.What's that? Speak up if you wanna say something, son! What?! No, Todd, it does not matter if the writing is full of plotholes so big they are actually safety hazards. Main thing to keep in mind is that we're dealing with a hypernervous *gamers* here anyway and they just can't cope with long introductions and thoughtful setups. We have to make as many cuts as possible and also introduce a couple of dozen more characters! Yes, Todd, I'm sure about it. After all, my 11-year-old does play Fortnite so I know a thing or two about the mind of a gamer.Meanwhile, the gamer: *proceeds to play a random Fallout title in which the main story alone is about 50 hours long and happily immerses themselves into the world and there's nothing they hate more than bad action, cheap graphics, stiff dialogue and getting rushed through the story while at the same time being held up with trivial fetch quests*EDIT: My, oh my. It actually gets worse. I already wondered where the Asian typecast was and then they have that tinkery, nerdy woman who likes science and stuff. Guess what ethnicity they chose for that character? It's a very different kind of racism we are in the process of developing and it baffles me that nobody is offended by it. Also, the writing gets worse and the camera is always moving around ever so slightly to mask that nothing is actually happening in the scene. The choreography of the action is amateurish, full of errors and overloaded with bad CGI. I do like the actors and they certainly do their best (esp. Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten, you can see they had fun delving into their characters) but overall, this is yet another series that is already massively overrated. Some other reviewers stated it succinctly: this is much more a Disney production than anything else.EDIT2: A lot of people out there relegate the bad reviews to gamer rage. Funnily enough, there aren't that many 1/10 reviews out there, and much more inflated 9s and 10s. And what's even more curious: if you go to the respective forums, you can easily see that Fallout fans actually love the adaption because it is truthful and full of hidden lore. But I am not only a Fallout fan but also a fan of great TV shows. And this one is simply not one of them.	st main protagonist male griefe whitehis child exceptionally bright brave mix race reason except work today compare e g last we nd main protagonist jovial resilient female whitefather figure wise kind way whiteall young man weak intimate life whitefirst villain female ethnically ambiguous rd main protagonist trouble past issue anger male blackbest friend rd protagonist tough sly ambiguous gender latinalrighty folk really swell go mandatory checklist let get story many random scene possible split one narrative four understand make fit later edit room think conventional story four conventional story matter like snapshot trademark fallout feel speak wan na say something son todd matter write full plothole big actually safety hazard main thing keep mind deal hypernervous gamer anyway cope long introduction thoughtful setup make many cut possible also introduce couple dozen character yes todd sure year old play fortnite know thing two mind gamer meanwhile gamer proceed play random fallout title main story alone hour long happily immerse world nothing hate bad action cheap graphic stiff dialogue get rush story time hold trivial fetch quest edit oh actually get bad already wonder asian typecast tinkery nerdy woman like science stuff guess ethnicity choose character different kind racism process develop baffle nobody offend also write get bad camera always move around ever slightly mask nothing actually happen scene choreography action amateurish full error overload bad cgi like actor certainly well esp ella purnell aaron moten see fun delve character overall yet another series already massively overrate reviewer state succinctly much disney production anything else edit lot people relegate bad review gamer rage funnily enough many review much inflate even curious go respective forum easily see fallout fan actually love adaption truthful full hide lore fallout fan also fan great tv show one simply one
2	As is the norm, not subscribing to cable (or even owning a TV for that matter) I got into this after it's inception. Not sure if I'd like it or not, decided to try with it due to the fact Nathan Fillion was in the lead role. I've been a fan of his acting since Firefly, and later on with Castle, which was a lot lighter, but entertaining none the less. With all that said, I'm streaming the first season of The Rookie, and loving it. So far, there are no unlikable actors/characters, and it's truly not what I expected (in a good way) suspenseful drama that can literally keep you on the edge of your seat. The two part episode midway through was hella intense. There is a bit of violence, but it totally fits in and not over the top. No sex/nudity, and for me the best part is no swearing, including taking the Lords name in vain, which for me could be a deal breaker. Great show, writing, directing, and cast!	norm subscribe cable even own tv matter get inception sure like decide try due fact nathan fillion lead role fan act since firefly later castle lot light entertain none less say stream first season rookie love far unlikable actor character truly expect good way suspenseful drama literally keep edge seat two part episode midway hella intense bite violence totally fit top sex nudity good part swear include take lord name vain could deal breaker great show write direct cast

0	I used to love this show. I grew up watching it. Their newer episodes concerning abortion showed me how truly corrupt the pro-choice movement was and catalyzed further research on my part. Those episodes were DISGUSTING. I used to believe abortion was okay in certain circumstances, but this was absolute insanity. This show, I understand, is basically a glorified prime time soap opera program, but it's now turned into PURE propaganda. It's alarming. It's overtly ENCOURAGING abortion. I what happened to making it safe, legal, and rare? I read somewhere that someone involved in this show is on the board for Planned Parenthood. This is absurd. I'm over it. And I'm pro-life after decades of thinking differently.	use love show grow watch new episode concern abortion show truly corrupt pro choice movement catalyze research part episode disgust use believe abortion okay certain circumstance absolute insanity show understand basically glorify prime time soap opera program turn pure propaganda alarm overtly encourage abortion happen make safe legal rare read somewhere someone involve show board plan parenthood absurd pro life decade think differently
2	I have played all the games and was eagerly anticipating the release of the show. To be honest, I didn't expect it to be as good as it turned out to be. I was expecting a lighthearted approach with more comedy and less violence and gore. However, I was pleasantly shocked by the direction the show took, which was a perfect blend of action, violence, humor, and storytelling.The pacing of each episode was spot on, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout. I was hooked from the very first episode, and each subsequent episode left me wanting more. The story was captivating, and I loved how the show explored it from every perspective. I found myself empathizing with each faction, and I couldn't help but feel invested in their respective journeys. At the moment, I am firmly on team Coop, but I am open to switching sides in the upcoming season.However, the only minor issue I had with the show was something that most people could probably guess. I understand that many studios feel compelled to include certain elements for political reasons, and this show was no exception. While I acknowledge the importance of these issues, I felt that it detracted somewhat from the overall experience. Despite this, I still greatly enjoyed the show and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thrilling, action-packed adventure with plenty of heart and soul.	play game eagerly anticipate release show honest expect good turn expect lighthearted approach comedy less violence gore however pleasantly shock direction show take perfect blend action violence humor storytelle pace episode spot keep edge seat throughout hook first episode subsequent episode leave want story captivate love show explore every perspective find empathize faction help feel invest respective journey moment firmly team coop open switch side upcoming season however minor issue show something people could probably guess understand many studio feel compel include certain element political reason show exception acknowledge importance issue feel detract somewhat overall experience despite still greatly enjoy show would highly recommend anyone look thrill action pack adventure plenty heart soul

Absolute crap, especially when judged against the first two seasons. The writers, directors, actors, in fact everyone associated with this episode should hang their heads in shame. Do everyone a favour and pull the plug on this show NOW as there is no coming back from this crap. I would rate the show a solid 7 for the first two seasons. I gave it a 2 here based on season 3 episode 7 as nobody reads 1 star reviews, or 9 and 10 for that matter.	two season pretty good cop show come season slide hill rock bottom episode jump shark absolute crap especially judge first two season writer director actor fact everyone associate episode hang head shame everyone favour pull plug show come back crap would rate show solid first two season give base season episode nobody read star review matter
0	"I actually liked this series, at least for half season. But as the story continued, turned out Toranaga as a leader, was willing to sacrifice anyone (but himself) for his personal cause (to be a shogun). Most of his closest friends and family died, not by fighting the enemies but by being taken advantage of their loyalties. In fact Toranaga gave them a ""purpose"" to die, wrapped in a so called ""honour"". In the end he was the only one who won. I can only imagine how cold he was as a character, enjoying his victory and living rest of his life at ease with all his closest friends and family died on his watch. I had high hopes that Toranaga would turn out to be a honourable leader like Katsumoto in ""The Last Samurai"". So much for a Japanese ""honour"". I'm only glad I didn't read the book, saved my time by watching the series but regret that such an awful character won the story."	actually like series least half season story continue turn toranaga leader will sacrifice anyone personal cause shogun close friend family die fight enemy take advantage loyalty fact toranaga give purpose die wrap call honour end one imagine cold character enjoy victory live rest life ease close friend family die watch high hop toranaga would turn honourable leader like katsumoto last samurai much japanese honour glad read book save time watch series regret awful character story
0	First i've not read the books and i wont read a fantasy book that fatter than my encyclopedia. Sure Sean Bean did hold my interest enough so i bothered to even look the source material and keep watching, but that was it. After they killed his character the show started missing enough charismatic actors to keep it interesting. You had Charles Dance, again killed in spectacularly idiotic fashion. And we are left with cast's outcasts, who do passable job if the plot is good, sadly it isn't. And that is this tv show's problem it's quality has been dropping and has finally tanked, simple as that. Now maybe that it got too hyped, it continued too long, but while i wasn't looking forward to seasons 2-3 at least they were interesting and kept me watching, this last season(8) and later season from 4 i feel like sitting back and watching Married with children would be more entertaining and edge of the seat exciting.	first read book will not read fantasy book fatter encyclopedia sure sean bean hold interest enough bother even look source material keep watch kill character show start miss enough charismatic actor keep interest charle dance kill spectacularly idiotic fashion leave cast outcast passable job plot good sadly tv show problem quality drop finally tank simple maybe get hype continue long look forward season least interest keep watch last season later season feel like sit back watch marry child would entertain edge seat excite
1	First time viewer, I find the OR scenes to be good drama but the cast of characters? My, oh, my. So many shallow people, (Bailey aside), in one drama series. George who fits more in as village idiot than any serious medical person you'd be happy to let loose with a scalpel. Meredith Grey would probably be sectioned in the real world though her mother played a brilliant role. The on-off relationship with Derek Shepherd is nauseating. I shall probably continue to watch for the terrific medical drama that it is and right now I'm in the 3rd series and hoping George makes an early exit. Paradoxically, Christina is probably sociopathic but will be a great surgeon and will probably chill with time	first time viewer find scene good drama cast character oh many shallow people bailey aside one drama series george fit village idiot serious medical person happy let loose scalpel meredith grey would probably section real world though mother play brilliant role relationship derek shepherd nauseate shall probably continue watch terrific medical drama right rd series hop george make early exit paradoxically christina probably sociopathic great surgeon probably chill time
1	Knowing about the book, I was very excited to start this show alas the whole thing was underwhelming. The storylines that are interesting are the ones where they've tried to stay in-line with the book. The rest of the stories are very disjointed, the friend group?! Yikes. Some of the characters are so weak that it is hard to be interested in their stories.The flashbacks and the 'game' are some of the more compelling parts that pique interest alas as soon as the story reverts to current time it falls apart.Everything has been dumbed down and diluted with some bad writing and some average acting. A total shame that Netflix fumbled a potentially epic show.	know book excite start show alas whole thing underwhelme storyline interest one try stay line book rest story disjoint friend group yike character weak hard interest story flashback game compel part pique interest alas soon story revert current time fall apart everything dumbe dilute bad write average act total shame netflix fumble potentially epic show
1	This Prime adaptation of Bethesda's hugely successful game series does a surprisingly good job of both being a decent watch in it's own right, and of bringing the games to life.Fallout was a well-chosen title to adapt: it's enormously rich in story, creativity, humour and atmosphere throughout. It's utterly immersive and full of fabulous, convincing characters and places.The story begins in the claustrophobic confines of Vault 33, home to what's left of the human race in a post-apocalyptic world. And they're a surprisingly cheerful and phelgmatic bunch. Until circumstances oblige our heroine, Lucy, to leave the safe familiarity of the Vault and go exploring the unknown Wastelands above. And then all hell breaks loose.If you have played the games, the look, tone, sounds and details will take you right back there, and there's very little to complain about. Many of the scenes, costumes, and characters will be delightfully familiar.But is it great TV? Well, yes and no.I really enjoyed Fallout, and honestly I think there is much to like about it. And it's clear that some people who haven't played the game, and indeed might not normally be fans of this genre, enjoyed it too - see the review by the usually hard-to-please Lucy Mangan in The Gurdian, for example.However, personally I'm not convinced that it would be easy to 'get it' if you come to this cold.What do I mean by that? Well, solidly delivered emotional or action scenes will frequently be punctuated by moments of very cheesy humour that could feel awkward, but again are true to the source material. The cheesiness is also quite effective relief from the very graphic (if cartoon-like) violence and horror.Similarly, some of the sets and studio lighting really look like something straight out of 1970s TV (cardboard rocks and painted backdrops). But so what? It's a game adaptation - it's allowed to look slightly unreal, and even that production style feels deliberately chosen to add to the retro kitsch vibe.Meanwhile, many of the characters are just great - Walton Goggins' The Ghoul chief among them, with honourable mentions to Sarita Choudhary as Moldava and Michael Emerson as Wilzig (aka The Head).Elia Purnell does a fine and charming job of carrying the lead as Lucy MacLean, and it's great to see Kyle MacLachlan appearing as her father - again a welcome throwback to worthy forebearers of this show including Twin Peaks and Dune (you know, the other one). But yes, criticism of Aaron Moten's turn as Maximus is probably fair - his range of emotions seem broader when he's in the T60 suit than when he's out of it.Give it a go, you might like it. If you played the game, I reckon it's a 9/10. If not, it's still fun if you go with the flow. And if you don't like it, well it's not the end of the world...	prime adaptation bethesda hugely successful game series surprisingly good job decent watch right bring game life fallout well choose title adapt enormously rich story creativity humour atmosphere throughout utterly immersive full fabulous convince character place story begin claustrophobic confine vault home leave human race post apocalyptic world surprisingly cheerful phelgmatic bunch circumstance oblige heroine lucy leave safe familiarity vault go explore unknown wasteland hell break loose play game look tone sound detail take right back little complain many scene costume character delightfully familiar great tv well yes really enjoy fallout honestly think much like clear people play game indeed might normally fan genre enjoy see review usually hard please lucy mangan gurdian example however personally convince would easy get come cold mean well solidly deliver emotional action scene frequently punctuate moment cheesy humour could feel awkward true source material cheesiness also quite effective relief graphic cartoon like violence horror similarly set studio light really look like something straight tv cardboard rock paint backdrop game adaptation allow look slightly unreal even production style feel deliberately choose add retro kitsch vibe meanwhile many character great walton goggin ghoul chief among honourable mention sarita choudhary moldava michael emerson wilzig aka head elia purnell fine charm job carry lead lucy maclean great see kyle maclachlan appear father welcome throwback worthy forebearer show include twin peak dune know one yes criticism aaron moten turn maximus probably fair range emotion seem broad suit give go might like play game reckon still fun go flow like well end world

In reality, about 13 percent of patients actually survive in the long-term, explained senior author Susan Enguidanos, Associate Professor at the Davis School and an expert in end-of-life care. ""Many people have no understanding of genuine CPR survival, making medical care decisions for their family members and themselves based on erroneous assumptions"".About 42 percent of older adults claim that their knowledge about health and medicine comes from television. As a result, most of these individuals base healthcare preferences on inaccurate concepts, such as how to survive a heart attack.The study discovered many interesting aspects about CPR, basically discrepancies between what is shown on television and the reality. The research team viewed episodes of famous medical shows and found 46 different depictions of CPR – defibrillation or chest compressions. They recorded whether the patients in the shows lived or died after the technique, the cause of their cardiac arrest, their backgrounds and age."	grey anatomy believe everything see half patient receive cpr make adequate recovery reality percent patient actually survive long term explain senior author susan enguidanos associate professor davis school expert end life care many people understand genuine cpr survival make medical care decision family member base erroneous assumption percent old adult claim knowledge health medicine come television result individual base healthcare preference inaccurate concept survive heart attack study discover many interest aspect cpr basically discrepancy show television reality research team view episode famous medical show find different depiction cpr defibrillation chest compression record whether patient show live die technique cause cardiac arrest background age

2	The premise of Fallout is very disturbing and dark, but the writers did a magnificent job of balancing that with humor. In fact, I would say how they handled the dark with the light is the best part of this series.Fallout must be gory, edgy, profane, and disgusting. Some are put off by that, but that is the Fallout world. Those who have played the games know that well. The producers did a good job presenting that world. The contrast between vault dwellers and the above-grounders was well crafted.The characterizations, for the most part, were good. The costuming was excellent. The settings and attention to details was very good. This is one of those series where the cost of production can skyrocket within just a few seasons and likely cause it to be canceled. But I hope we can get several seasons before that happens.	premise fallout disturb dark writer magnificent job balance humor fact would say handle dark light good part series fallout must gory edgy profane disgust put fallout world play game know well producer good job present world contrast vault dweller grounder well craft characterization part good costume excellent setting attention detail good one series cost production skyrocket within season likely cause cancel hope get several season happen
1	Sometimes it seems all the big networks make are police/legal procedurals or medical dramas. Rookie really stood out, which is a challenge in that primetime environment.Following an older rookie was a smart idea. The patrol aspect is the best. It's chaotic, hectic, feels far less contrived. We get to see what feels like a more real portrayal of the lives of men and women in law enforcement. It's funny, it's poignant.In later seasons, this disappears quickly and the show becomes much like every other police procedural show. Performances remain pretty solid, but there's a bunch of silly extraneous drama added for everyone to have something to do. Little or nothing of patrol. Investigations. Serial killers obsessed with the featured officers. Less surprises, life lessons and tie ins you can see coming a mile away.Season 5 had a chance to return to the basics with Nolan becoming a trainer himself, but no dice unfortunately. Feels like a mountain of wasted opportunities. Watch season 1 and pretend it was cancelled after that.	sometimes seem big network make police legal procedural medical drama rookie really stand challenge primetime environment follow old rookie smart idea patrol aspect well chaotic hectic feel far less contrive get see feel like real portrayal live man woman law enforcement funny poignant later season disappear quickly show become much like every police procedural show performance remain pretty solid bunch silly extraneous drama add everyone something little nothing patrol investigation serial killer obsess feature officer less surprise life lesson tie in see come mile away season chance return basic nolan become trainer dice unfortunately feel like mountain waste opportunity watch season pretend cancel

The Portuguese are once again portrayed in a position without any merit.Even the Spaniard is portrayed as a reckless and impulsive pilot, while the Englishman is the competent pilot who saves the boat.This is why the UK and the USA have culturally conquered the world, they have brainwashed people's historical memory.I don't have much more to add, I don't know why it has such a high score, the plot is nothing exceptional.Just another product driven by the powerful marketing of the film industry.	yet another play history misrepresent would even say mislead despite portray greatness japan englishman play key role story portuguese portray position without merit even spaniard portray reckless impulsive pilot englishman competent pilot save boat uk usa culturally conquer world brainwash people historical memory much add know high score plot nothing exceptional another product drive powerful market film industry

2	"Having completed Fallout 3, New Vegas, and Fallout 4, I initially expected to dislike this series, but I found myself binge-watching it through the night.The Fallout games are renowned for their post-apocalyptic and atompunk RPG elements, featuring a vast exploratory scale, eccentric factions, gratuitous violence, and offbeat humor.This series encapsulates all those aspects while managing to strike a balance by infusing a grounded dramatic tone that intertwines the excesses within a Western-style narrative structure, typical of modern series. It seamlessly integrates the main quest with character development, glimpses into the pre-nuclear world, and compelling sequences set within the Vault.Contrary to my initial concerns, the series avoids being overly absurd, showcasing well-thought-out design elements. The dialogue feels authentic, the storyline, albeit eccentric, aligns with the universe's essence, and the actors deliver performances that lend credibility to the narrative.Walton Goggins shines as Ghoul, Kyle MacLachlan impresses with his portrayal, and the entire cast delivers commendable performances. The chemistry between Lucy and Maximus is particularly noteworthy.It seems like Bethesda's Todd Howard has reason to celebrate, as this series is poised for success and may even boost sales of the original Fallout games. Following the success of ""The Last of Us,"" this adaptation further solidifies TV as a platform to expand upon vast gaming worlds.I am optimistic about the continuation of this trend and wholeheartedly recommend this series to fans of the genre and anyone who appreciates sci-fi and fantasy subgenres.

1	This show is absolutely stunning. It contains some of the most well fleshed out characters and plotlines ever written, containing gripping plot twists and unmatched character dialogue. However, this is not true for the entire series. Seasons 1-6 are incredibly written and acted, and remain the pinnacle of modern television. Season 7, while still great, is just that. Fabulous and entertaining, yet not golden. The final season and it's ending, however, have ruined the show, and will leave you feeling utterly disappointed and dismassed.While previous seasons have featured stunning plot points and made revolutionary contributions to modern storytelling, the final season and it's conclusion lacks any semblance of these previous seasons, ignoring seasons of character development, illogical plotlines, and absurd dialogue. The whole season feels so out of place and nonsensical that it tarnishes the legacy of Game of Thrones. After seventy-odd episodes of epic build-up, Game of Thrones is a frustrating let down with a poorly written conclusion. Plotlines built up over seven seasons vanish with no payoff, and characters you are so vested in suddenly lose their multi-faceted layers of development in a confusingly written mess. Because of this, I sadly recommend avoiding the series completely.	show absolutely stun contain well flesh character plotline ever write contain grip plot twist unmatched character dialogue however true entire series season incredibly write act remain pinnacle modern television season still great fabulous entertain yet golden final season end however ruin show leave feel utterly disappoint dismasse previous season feature stun plot point make revolutionary contribution modern storytelle final season conclusion lack semblance previous season ignore season character development illogical plotline absurd dialogue whole season feel place nonsensical tarnish legacy game throne seventy odd episode epic build game throne frustrate let poorly write conclusion plotline build seven season vanish payoff character vest suddenly lose multi faceted layer development confusingly write mess sadly recommend avoid series completely

0	The first two seasons were pretty good, but season 3 is unwatchable. They transformed it into some nonsense about racism with the most unbelievable actor at the center of it all. They seem to have completely lost focus of what this show was about. Season 4 seems slightly better so far, but I don't feel that they will be able to recapture the magic that made the first two seasons so fun...I got 3 episodes in on season 3, read some reviews and saw that it wasn't going to change, so I skipped to season 4, and I'm not at all impressed. This isn't a cop show anymore. What the flip are they doing with it? I imagined this show following the progression of a group of rookies until they eventually got detective or whatever, but that's not what this show is at all. Season 4 has turned this into the most unbelievable cop show I have seen in awhile.Fillion is really the only reason I'm watching this show anymore.	first two season pretty good season unwatchable transform nonsense racism unbelievable actor center seem completely lose focus show season seem slightly well far feel able recapture magic make first two season fun get episode season read review see go change skip season impress cop show anymore flip imagine show follow progression group rookie eventually get detective whatever show season turn unbelievable cop show see awhile fillion really reason watch show anymore
0	The first seasons are very well made and exciting. But the more they start to deviate from the books, the worse it gets. The problem is not going off the original, that's fine. The problem is their writers can't manage it. There is a serious decline in interesting writing or plot. It's especially clear in the last season, which is nothing but an endless parade of unfinished story arcs, anti climaxes and battle scenes where you can't see a thing that's happening and completely illogical nonsensical desicions. (Like placing seige equipment at the front and only having them fire blindly once in one particularly badly done battle). It's very sloppy, it feels like the creators didn't have good enough help with writing and directing after the series started deviating from the source material. Don't watch the last season. I would give it 7/10 if it wasn't for the last season. Or just watch the six first seasons and pretend it ended there. You will just be hugely dissatisfied if you watch the last few seasons since nothing is properly concluded.	first season well make excite start deviate book bad get problem go original fine problem writer manage serious decline interest write plot especially clear last season nothing endless parade unfinished story arc anti climax battle scene see thing happen completely illogical nonsensical desicion like place seige equipment front fire blindly one particularly badly do battle sloppy feel like creator good enough help write direct series start deviate source material watch last season would give last season watch six first season pretend end hugely dissatisfy watch last season since nothing properly conclude
0	"I didn't have much hope for the show, considering Bethesda's track record of retcons. Having the show take place in California raised the stakes even further. Todd Howard claiming the show was going to be canon was practically a death sentence for classic Fallout's lore. Low and behold, the show comes out and all my fears were realized. So many retcons, even of Bethesda's own additions from 3 and 4. Claiming that T60 power armour was used in the liberation of Anchorage, making ghouls dependent on a seemingly magical serum which keeps them from turning feral, changing what time the bombs dropped on the west coast, erasing the most important location Fallout has ever and will ever have lore wise (Shady Sands), reviving the west coast Brotherhood and turning them into a weird pseudo-Enclave military faction akin to what has been seen on the east coast, not to mention the fact that the west coast brother would NEVER fly an American flag, something they are seen doing in the show. The Brotherhood of Steel originating as a fraction of the US military, which seceded from the United States after finding out what was going on in Mariposa. Placing the TV show in California was seemingly a way for Bethesda to finally destroy the last remnants of Black Isles and Obsidian's work from the Fallout franchise. The show displays an obvious disregard for the lore of the universe and location in which it takes place.Furthermore, the show has some arguably ""cringy"" moments. Lucy using the term ""Raider"" to refer to the outsiders infiltrating vault 33; raider being a term developed and used by people living in the wasteland. How does she know to refer to them using this name, when she is shown to be as clueless about the outside world as not being familiar, and even spooked by a tumbleweed upon leaving the vault for the first time. There are also a couple of what I assume to be self inserts by the lead team of Bethesda. Two Vault-Tec employees are named Howard and Emil respectively, who I can only assume to be self inserts of Todd Howard and Emil Pagliarulo. Overall the show feels weirdly disrespectful of established west coast lore, more often than not ignoring it, if not outright retconning established, known facts."	much hope show consider bethesda track record retcon show take place california raise stake even todd howard claim show go canon practically death sentence classic fallout lore low behold show come fear realize many retcon even bethesda addition claim power armour use liberation anchorage make ghoul dependent seemingly magical serum keep turn feral change time bomb drop west coast erase important location fallout ever ever lore wise shady sand revive west coast brotherhood turn weird pseudo enclave military faction akin see east coast mention fact west coast brother would never fly american flag something see show brotherhood steel originate fraction we military secede unite state find go mariposa place tv show california seemingly way bethesda finally destroy last remnant black isle obsidian work fallout franchise show display obvious disregard lore universe location take place furthermore show arguably cringy moment lucy use term raider refer outsider infiltrate vault raider term develop use people live wasteland know refer use name show clueless outside world familiar even spook tumblewee upon leave vault first time also couple assume self insert lead team bethesda two vault tec employee name howard emil respectively assume self insert todd howard emil pagliarulo overall show feel weirdly disrespectful establish west coast lore often ignore outright retconne establish know fact
1	I really enjoyed seasons 1-2 and was looking forward to watching the other seasons but I just can't get through season 3.Season 3 is basically political correctness and BLM being forced down your neck when you just want to sit back, relax, enjoy and watch a programme to forget about the world.It paints the police in a bad light even when they are trying to do the right thing which does not help their public image and can potentially turn more people against them even though in reality there are only a few bad police just like there are only a few bad people but unfortunately hate/despair/death is what sells in the media so that is all that's reported and made into a bigger issue than it is.I will try season 4 to see if it improves but I won't hold my breath.	really enjoy season look forward watch season get season season basically political correctness blm force neck want sit back relax enjoy watch programme forget world paint police bad light even try right thing help public image potentially turn people even though reality bad police like bad people unfortunately hate despair death sell medium report make big issue try season see improve hold breath

I wonder how she got the role?!Some of the CGI are quite good, while some look a bit sloppy.I also think this is a pretty good adaptation considering all the elements and complicated structures in the novels.Give it a go if you like sci-fi, but I would suggest you either mute or fast forward all the scenes with Auggie."	wrong one play auggie oh gosh even think call actress coz damn bad know act everything either rigid overdo actually quite enjoy show whenever scene kill everything wonder get role cgi quite good look bite sloppy also think pretty good adaptation consider element complicate structure novel give go like sci fi would suggest either mute fast forward scene auggie

0	I actually found this series quite boring, i always doze off while watching it and have to rewind. All you see is people speaking Japanese. There's no entertainment value. This could have been a podcast and you wouldn't miss much. I can't believe people dare comparing this to Game of Thrones. Yes G. O. T. Is made of political intrigues and had a lot of dialogs but first we knew who was speaking and were familiar with their characters. G. O. T. Is a characters masterpiece. Furthermore G. O. T. Had epic battles, dragons, monsters etc. Shogun tricks the viewers by giving a little bit to make them believe more is there. In the first episode you have brief nudity for those who are into that and that's it. At the end of episode 2 you have 30 seconds of action to make you want to watch the next episode. But in fact there's not much happening. In the 3rd episode there is action but it's in the dark. Another trick by a cheap production because in the dark they don't have to worry too much about details. Also the big-headed, dead eyes actor who plays John Blackthorn is not very good. There are so many great British actors who would have nailed that part. I rated it 2 stars for the costumes and the sets but that's really all we've got here. This is no game of thrones. One episode of game of thrones cost more to make than this entire series.	actually find series quite bore always doze watch rewind see people speak japanese entertainment value could podcast miss much believe people dare compare game throne yes g make political intrigue lot dialog first know speak familiar character g character masterpiece furthermore g epic battle dragon monster etc shogun trick viewer give little bite make believe first episode brief nudity end episode second action make want watch next episode fact much happen rd episode action dark another trick cheap production dark worry much detail also big head dead eye actor play john blackthorn good many great british actor would nail part rat star costume set really get game throne one episode game throne cost make entire series

1	Far and away the best part of this 8-Part series is the first 15 minutes of Episode 1, but as realistic as they attempted to make the nuclear blasts seem, they still got that all wrong. And it was all downhill from there. I kept waiting for an intriguing plotline to develop from the several parallel stories presented, but no such luck. Alot of the set design on the surface had the feel of a low budget Mad Max film, and the scenes inside the vault played like big budget MST3K episode. Walton Goggins provided the only character of any discernable depth, and frankly provided the only dialogue in the whole eight-part series that was worth a damn. The rest of the characters were pretty much idiots. I can see from the other reviews that the series was a somewhat faithful adaptation of the video game, but that just tells me we need to stop using video games as source material for films and TV. 6/10.	far away good part part series first minute episode realistic attempt make nuclear blast seem still get wrong downhill keep wait intrigue plotline develop several parallel story present luck alot set design surface feel low budget mad max film scene inside vault play like big budget mst k episode walton goggin provide character discernable depth frankly provide dialogue whole eight part series worth damn rest character pretty much idiot see review series somewhat faithful adaptation video game tell need stop use video game source material film tv
1	Let me first say, I don't play video games. And I never even heard of this one. The trailer look interesting and when our 18 year old want to watch with us, well you take the offer. Secondly I like Last of Us. Thought it was interesting and after years of sloughing through the Walking Dead final seasons, was a better take on the zombie genre.Now to Fallout. The last of us, I felt I didn't need anything from the video game to understand the story. However Fallout, not so much. If you play the game you'll probably get it more than I did. Fallout is more fantastical than I like. The script seems weak, the characters are little odd acting, campy? Not sure. The story drags in huge parts. The score is off.Yes it's a pretty shot show. Nice camera work. Nice color saturation. However for this 53 year old, it just wasn't my thing.	let first say play video game never even hear one trailer look interest year old want watch we well take offer secondly like last we think interest year slough walk dead final season well take zombie genre fallout last we feel need anything video game understand story however fallout much play game probably get fallout fantastical like script seem weak character little odd act campy sure story drag huge part score yes pretty shoot show nice camera work nice color saturation however year old thing

0	Seriously, save yourself at least 3 hours, more like 9 hours of your life. The premise is interesting and from episode 2 to 4 it draws you in and makes you think this will be a great show. No doubt the book was good but Netflix and Hollywood have completely butchered this. It appears Netflix is suffering from the chaotic instability of the three-body problem and somehow managed to turn this from a well-regarded sci-fi book into a ridiculous 20 something teen. Nothing much happens over emotional bunch of garbage show that will just waste your time and make you wish actual aliens invaded us for the sins of Netflix.I rarely will leave a review but the last four episodes were just so goddamn bad.

1	"Netflix did it once again. It's becoming an annoying habit.I must say Ripley starts FANTASTIC. During the first four episodes I was recommending the show to everyone I know. Details from Ripley's life in NY, which didn't appear in ""Talented Ripley"" with Matt Damon, were so well filmed and really contrasted with the scenes later in Italy, even if it's all black and white.Photography is outstanding throughout the whole show. It made me think the series would be one of the best I would ever see, it would become cult and soon they would be selling pictures and T-shirts with nice cuts from the show.The story builds up nice up until said fourth episode. (Even if Dickie and Freddie's characters felt a little miss in casting.)Then we start to feel like the original script had 5 or 6 episodes but Netflix needed 8. Or are they being paid by the episode? It gets really annoying to see how they stretch out every bit of scene they can (waiting for people to pick up the phone, showing weird interactions with receptionists, infinite scenes of a cat, all that doesn't add up to the story). Many characters acts also start not making sense, and the series loses rhythm.So you end up fast-forwarding the final episodes and feel once again a great story with immense potential was wasted.I wish Netflix stopped doing that.6/10."	netflix become annoy habit must say ripley start fantastic first four episode recommend show everyone know detail ripley life ny appear talented ripley matt damon well film really contrast scene later italy even black white photography outstanding throughout whole show make think series would one good would ever see would become cult soon would sell picture shirt nice cut show story build nice say fourth episode even dickie freddie character feel little miss cast start feel like original script episode netflix need pay episode get really annoy see stretch every bite scene wait people pick phone show weird interaction receptionist infinite scene cat add story many character act also start make sense series lose rhythm end fast forward final episode feel great story immense potential waste wish netflix stop

0	Interesting plot with clever elements. The original idea is a thrilling story with multiple dimensions that could have turned into a generational moment for sci fi fans, to the likes of Game of Thrones for instance. And in fact, the series started off strong, but quickly, as characters came into focus: the show became boring and hard to get committed into. The acting and the cast is simply not up to par to the size of this story. The dialogues are dull, the characters are shallow and the general acting is uncommitted. The director re-write into a western format sounds completely off. It's truly a shame because the book held so much potential, and this has been wasted by poor directing and mediocre casting.	interest plot clever element original idea thrill story multiple dimension could turn generational moment sci fi fan like game throne instance fact series start strong quickly character come focus show become bore hard get commit act cast simply par size story dialogue dull character shallow general act uncommitted director write western format sound completely truly shame book hold much potential waste poor direct mediocre cast
2	Let me just start with clarifying that I have not read the books so I don't know if it's a good adaptation but as a show it is intriguing. While I have issues with some characters feeling lacking and the way they did things had me left wanting more tension overall there's a curiousity in me to know more.Now to me Episode 1-3 felt like an introduction... long one but I guess they needed that setup. It can get a bit dull even though some scenes had me wide eyed. Episode 4 is the start of the hook and episode 5 reels you in... so if you're thinking about the show I suggest to push through til episode 5 and if you didn't like what it wants to show then drop it.Shout out to those who made the title sequence because I love it. Also showing some love to my favorite characters: Liam Cunningham as Thomas Wade, Sea Shimooka as Sophon, and Marlo Kelly as Tatiana!Warning: Gore, nudity.	let start clarify read book know good adaptation show intrigue issue character feel lack way thing leave want tension overall curiousity know episode feel like introduction long one guess need setup get bite dull even though scene wide eye episode start hook episode reel think show suggest push til episode like want show drop shout make title sequence love also show love favorite character liam cunningham thomas wade sea shimooka sophon marlo kelly tatiana warn gore nudity
1	I was initially put off when I saw how much it deviated from the original storyline in the first few episodes. Was looking for Wang Miao (male lead character of book 1) and realised Auggie was meant to be him. Multiple plotlines were over-generalised and characters condensed to fit into the Netflix 8-episode format. However, there were some entertaining merits to the way the story was tweaked, which comes across as an attempt to make it more bite-sized (or dumbed-down) for audiences that have not read the books. Several of the key plots in the second and third books (which were meant to happen in different time periods) were mashed into this first season, which does not do the full story justice, since it is meant to span centuries.Ultimately I do feel entertained though, as this series took out some dramatic parts of the books to play out using the Hollywood machinery, with the downside of ignoring several other character plots that were essential the whole plot. The character of Luo Ji for example, was only revealed to be congruent to Saul in the last episode, and the whole transition felt like a desperate attempt to mish mash every actor's importance to draw relevance to the trilogy's readerbase.I hope season 2 onwards can start to veer back more to the original storyline.	initially put see much deviate original storyline first episode look wang miao male lead character book realise auggie mean multiple plotline generalise character condense fit netflix episode format however entertain merit way story tweak come across attempt make bite size dumbe audience read book several key plot second third book mean happen different time period mash first season full story justice since mean span century ultimately feel entertain though series take dramatic part book play use hollywood machinery downside ignore several character plot essential whole plot character luo ji example reveal congruent saul last episode whole transition feel like desperate attempt mish mash every actor importance draw relevance trilogy readerbase hope season onwards start veer back original storyline
2	This gorgeous, moody period piece is a lovely character study, slightly unnerving at times as the camera invites you into the mind of a man without morales and we experience with him envy and desire. Shot all in black and white we are deliberately steered away from the obviously beautiful to marvel at the ambiguous and worry when naivete leads our characters into danger or corruption. A really good understated performance from Johnny Flynn, though I prefer Matt Damon's version of Ripley this series gives a grittier feel to a still compelling piece of story telling. Makes me want to watch the original film again. Beware the wolf in the fairytale!	gorgeous moody period piece lovely character study slightly unnerve time camera invite mind man without morale experience envy desire shoot black white deliberately steer away obviously beautiful marvel ambiguous worry naivete lead character danger corruption really good understate performance johnny flynn though prefer matt damon version ripley series give gritty feel still compel piece story tell make want watch original film beware wolf fairytale

2	The amount of actor change ruins the overall experience. What really shocks me is the starting scene, where her father gets tortured, killed by her own relatives, because of being brainwashed by communism ideology. That really makes me disgust of communism, but I respect revolutionaries. Putting this movie in simple is shocking and futuristic, the way the girl had chose to answer the signal, is a way that I believe most people, would choose, because of so much disappointment. The environment of the movie pressurizes the girl to choose the way, but it's the same in the reality, this movie is the real warning towards society, that now environment can make a very huge impact to the young generations now, scientist are not being heard much but influencers are being the top of the interest among young people, scientist now had been becoming lesser influence each year, that only a major incident happened could make us people feel the existence of scientist. Overall not a bad movie, shocking views and I recommend to CHINA Chinese to see, watch, and not brainwashed by all the parties, they should understand and not being covered by all these mess the government had created, this is a movie targeted to Chinese, that I must say the environment creates people, edits people, changes people.	amount actor change ruin overall experience really shock start scene father get torture kill relative brainwash communism ideology really make disgust communism respect revolutionary put movie simple shock futuristic way girl choose answer signal way believe people would choose much disappointment environment movie pressurize girl choose way reality movie real warn towards society environment make huge impact young generation scientist hear much influencer top interest among young people scientist become less influence year major incident happen could make we people feel existence scientist overall bad movie shock view recommend china chinese see watch brainwash party understand cover mess government create movie target chinese must say environment create people edit people change people
1	Not quite respect to the original novel. It is true that the novel is such complicated to be visualised and be filmed. It is true that TV series will do some editorial on the plot based on the novel. However, it seems far beyond. To most of fans of the novel, the episode losses respects to the origin. It is nearly to re-write a plot with the concept of three body problem. Thus, it shouldn't be named as three body problem.As a Chinese, watching the episodes, just feel that Netflix only take shots of the part that Chinese creators aren't able to shoot in China if they want to publish in plublic. Other than that, it isn't the three body problems.It seems to extend the vision, however, it narrows the big concept of what the author wants to express.	quite respect original novel true novel complicate visualise film true tv series editorial plot base novel however seem far beyond fan novel episode loss respect origin nearly write plot concept three body problem thus name three body problem chinese watch episode feel netflix take shot part chinese creator able shoot china want publish plublic three body problem seem extend vision however narrow big concept author want express

2	So thought-provoking. This was very good, but it's a perfect example of something that should have drawn more from the original script. Too many significant changes, in my opinion. And, the game should have appeared more as a game. The characters being exactly themselves, just in different clothes, didn't really convey the understanding of what it was like in there. And they didn't spend nearly enough time in the game or with the countdown or with Ye Wenjie's background, or pretty much anything. They would have done better with 10 or 12 episodes and let us more enjoy and savor each stage. The original Three-Body is long (30 episodes) and in Chinese, but this version is missing so much detail I now realize was important to the overall story. Watch this and enjoy it, but try to find the time to watch the original.	think provoke good perfect example something draw original script many significant change opinion game appear game character exactly different clothe really convey understand like spend nearly enough time game countdown ye wenjie background pretty much anything would do well episode let we enjoy savor stage original three body long episode chinese version miss much detail realize important overall story watch enjoy try find time watch original

My rating is for season 1 and 2.I'm assuming at the end of season 2 either all the writers and senior staff were changed or they all had a stroke or head injuries because this show starts spiralling downhill fast in season 3. By the start of season 4 the story is absolutely ridiculous and the rookies have become Seal Team 6 (sorry guys probably quite insulting to you).So .. worth watching seasons 1 and 2 and then pretend that's where it finished.	season interest fun sure real life la police story good care character bite far fetch entertain believable mostly rat season assume end season either writer senior staff change stroke head injury show start spiral downhill fast season start season story absolutely ridiculous rookie become seal team sorry guy probably quite insult worth watch season pretend finish

If you believe any of this drivel, I have a bridge in Brooklyn you will be interested in buying. Really, this is such a silly slow show I am not sure why people like it, unless they are so starved for a quality show this is the best of the worst. I will let others decide. If you are a adolescent with a low IQ this may be believable to you. But if you have any brains at all you will soon realize this is all about suspense and nonsense where reality does not exist.	one series good scientist self center drug addict drunk always go around party believe drivel bridge brooklyn interest buy really silly slow show sure people like unless starve quality show well bad let other decide adolescent low iq may believable brain soon realize suspense nonsense reality exist
1	"If you like it great keep watching it I honestly don't care I'm just gonna list off reasons why I don't like loving a series that seems to be retconning/resetting all the past things they've created for something new that seems lame or same old cliche.Apparently the NCR isn't around anywhere in Cali; I'm 4 episodes in and I haven't seen a trace of them in any society function. Its only been 15-20 years since NV. They would be like Roman Empire, broken but into pieces more than anything. Nope its just people in tin shacks.Turning the BoS into this edgy london Knight/Lord theme. Yes their titles are Knight/Elder/Scribe/etc however I've never once seen them have dialogue like this show does. Its hammered into them since either birth in the bunkers or if we're going east coast then since they join.I'm not crazy of Lucy being the center not cause shes a bad actor but because I would of enjoyed her more if they simply either gave her smaller lines or mute to transition a RPG character almost just being dragged along in the story like most do.The writing is basic, people act like this is masterpiece writing but it isn't. They've done the father/son/daughter thing now 3 times.Fallout 3/4 and now this show. Its getting old. Oh but guess what the vault's waterchip is busted where else have I seen this.The world is bland, feels like they spent most of the budget on actors/costumes and thats about it. Theres one ""settlement"" if you wanna call it that and its somehow worse than megaton. Again in Cali where NCR had a full fledged nation happening."	like great keep watch honestly care go to list reason like love series seem retconne reset past thing create something new seem lame old cliche apparently ncr around anywhere cali episode see trace society function year since nv would like roman empire break piece anything nope people tin shack turn bos edgy london knight lord theme yes title knight elder scribe etc however never see dialogue like show hammer since either birth bunker go east coast since join crazy lucy center cause she s bad actor would enjoy simply either give small line mute transition rpg character almost drag along story like write basic people act like masterpiece write do father son daughter thing time fallout show get old oh guess vault waterchip bust else see world bland feel like spend budget actor costume that s there s one settlement wan na call somehow bad megaton cali ncr full fledge nation happen

I have read all of James Clavell's novels and I have seen the original series starring Richard Chamberlain and so I'm a huge fan of Shogun, that is the original story. But I am struggling to recognise much of this series, it looks great and the language and subtitles thing are not an issue for me, but I find it hard to follow and find myself losing interest and I doubt I will continue watching after this last episode 4. I don't understand why they have done this to this great story, the main character is awful, he annoys me more than any other aspect of this series. The only saving grace is the actor who plays Toranaga, he steals every scene he is in, but no matter how good the actors may or may not be, the story line is a mess and my advice is read the book, or watch the original series.	really really want like read jam clavell novel see original series star richard chamberlain huge fan shogun original story struggle recognise much series look great language subtitle thing issue find hard follow find lose interest doubt continue watch last episode understand do great story main character awful annoy aspect series save grace actor play toranaga steal every scene matter good actor may may story line mess advice read book watch original series
1	Loud raucous music every 15 seconds, smart-alecy cops that look like models, no pace setting in the narrative. This will appeal to the most avid TV junkies who watch more American television that anything else. In the hands of a more assured director this could have been a lovely show, because if one persists through the juvenile narrative style, the plots and characters aren't that bad. Some of them are even interesting and relatable. It surely isn't an 8 out of 10 rating as it currently shows on IMDB. A decent watch for slow periods between shows. At the moment Netflix, Amazon and HBO are rocking the production values in top shows in addition to stuff coming from Europe.	loud raucous music every second smart alecy cop look like model pace set narrative appeal avid tv junkie watch american television anything else hand assure director could lovely show one persist juvenile narrative style plot character bad even interest relatable surely rat currently show imdb decent watch slow period show moment netflix amazon hbo rock production value top show addition stuff come europe
0	Game of Thrones is an intricate and interesting story that thrives off of shock, titillation, and disgust. It brings out the worst of human emotions within the characters and is a poor influence on the minds of its watchers (people who mostly just want an epic fantasy). The attention that this series has gained is an unfortunate reflection on our society. While I can understand the allure of such an expansive world with many amazing qualities of a good fantasy, I cannot personally support a series that makes light of nudity, women, rape, and violence. My rating is for the quality of the story as well as the cinematography. I hope that people everywhere will recognize the effects that this series has on their thoughts and emotions as they become immersed in this filth. I also hope that parents will recognize the importance of avoiding bringing these sorts of influences into the home.	game throne intricate interest story thrive shock titillation disgust bring bad human emotion within character poor influence mind watcher people mostly want epic fantasy attention series gain unfortunate reflection society understand allure expansive world many amaze quality good fantasy personally support series make light nudity woman rape violence rat quality story well cinematography hope people everywhere recognize effect series thought emotion become immerse filth also hope parent recognize importance avoid bring sort influence home

What does he bring to the table, like literally and figuratively....absolutely nothing, no polish charm cleverness why would Marge and Dickie give him the time of day, it even renders Johnny Flynn dull flat lifeless.

2	A brilliant series and outstanding performances particularly Gunning (aka Martha) - she definitely brings stalking to a whole new level, sinister and powerful throughout. It's not so much the subject matter however, that bothers me but the fact it's based on true events.Donny (Gadd), at first comes across as a decent character but it's not long before one realises that his meek tendencies get slightly infuriating. He's annoying and it does get extremely difficult, as revelations unfold, for one to empathise with quite the selfish person he himself tends to be.I came away thinking that Gadd, indeed to a certain level, has his own mental health issues bordering on masochistic and mildly narcissistic (which was probably why he fell victim to what seemed so many unnecessary situations!) Talk about wanting him to give him a slap!That said all the subject matters portrayed were disturbing, uneasy to view and mystifying. A must watch.	brilliant series outstanding performance particularly gun aka martha definitely bring stalk whole new level sinister powerful throughout much subject matter however bother fact base true event donny gadd first come across decent character long one realise meek tendency get slightly infuriate annoy get extremely difficult revelation unfold one empathise quite selfish person tend come away think gadd indeed certain level mental health issue border masochistic mildly narcissistic probably fall victim seem many unnecessary situation talk want give slap say subject matter portray disturb uneasy view mystify must watch
0	I watched the original 1980's series and really enjoyed it so was pleased to see it had been remade. With great anticipation I watched the new series, or at least so far. Only finding the there is, and a further search later, finding that there was never any intention of completing the whole book... Tell me, what is the point. Let's just do up to act 2 of a 3 act play, or perhaps Obi Wan being murdered by Darth Vader then stopping filming. This along with the earlier series The Borgias is just pathetic. In future I will await a completed product before investing my time in a half cocked production. Cheers, Paul.	watch original series really enjoy please see remake great anticipation watch new series least far find search later find never intention complete whole book tell point let act act play perhaps obi wan murder darth vader stop film along early series borgia pathetic future await complete product invest time half cock production cheer paul

1	"Well , well, I gave it a 6/10.. This movie use to be my favorite movie. I use to love it. But unfortunately it became a soap opera. There were characters I loved and started really not liking them and characters I hated and started liking them. Everybody is sleeping over with everybody and they are cheating, it has lack of moral values, it's not about the doctors ob anymore to do it right or to show the best out of them, it's about the doctor's lives which is in my opinion so pointless and low. This movies should teach something, like taking responsibility for your actions and especially on a job like doctors have, but it's the the other way around.Well, the way the 3d season has ended and they way they have complicated things, I just am not interested in season 4 anymore. I hope still..that it won't become like ""Hercules"" or ""Xena"" which were really great at the beginning and than both of the movies became a joke.. but the way they seem to have given me ideas at the last episode of season 3.. I just feel it's going to be the same!I still gave it a 6 because I did like it at the beginning and there where episodes that made me cry.It's sad though that they've kind of slipped out of the real idea and the theme of the movie"	well well give movie use favorite movie use love unfortunately become soap opera character love start really like character hat start like everybody sleep everybody cheat lack moral value doctor ob anymore right show good doctor live opinion pointless low movie teach something like take responsibility action especially job like doctor way around well way season end way complicate thing interest season anymore hope still become like hercules xena really great begin movie become joke way seem give idea last episode season feel go still give like begin episode make cry sad though kind slip real idea theme movie
2	I haven't read the original book,so I don't know much about details. But after I finished my watching,I think the experience was beyond my expectation. Dr. Ye's sad past, the worries and fears brought by Santi civilization to mankind, and the love between Cheng Jin and her boyfriend was just amazing. Still it has some bad aspects. Its narrative pace and plot progress are too fast, and the changes to the main characters are too large. The story itself was also been reorganized,so some plot were missing,which could be barriers for you to understand each character deeply. Despite of these bad things,it is without doubt a good TV series nowadays.	read original book know much detail finish watch think experience beyond expectation dr ye sad past worry fear bring santi civilization mankind love cheng jin boyfriend amaze still bad aspect narrative pace plot progress fast change main character large story also reorganize plot miss could barrier understand character deeply despite bad thing without doubt good tv series nowadays
0	"What can I say. It's like Journey without Steve Perry. Ohh sure they can sort of duplicate the voice, but the good song writing went right out the window. Ohh sure if you look at older Journey albums practically ever song has Co-writing credits, one guy leaves and suddenly...no hits! The guy himself goes on to write a few, but his former band suddenly can't buy one! The results speak for themselves.Same thing here, Whomever took these rich characters and storylines by Martin just isn't up to the task of completing the series well. It was a whole bunch of smashed together vignettes of the Starks going off to their various fates.Some people might like the way Snow killed Daenerys. I thought it was ridiculous. She suddenly dropped all her guard and acted like Snow was just going to be Prince Charming to her Snow White. She SHOULD have been guarded and Snow SHOULD have had to convince her it was going to be alright and then killed her. Instead she was all smiles. Totally out of character.When Sansa declared she would rule her own kingdom the others just accepted that? Bwahahahaha. Especially Greyjoy, like she would play nice. ""Well we like Daenerys, but if you all want this, OK"" Does that seem anything like her?It could have ended after the first fade to black, but returned time and again for at least 15 minutes.After everything you've seen up till now, does anybody think the Unsullied and the Dalthraci would NOT put up with Jon Snow and Lannister surviving? That they would just accept the will of the people? They literally hate all the people!I don't know exactly what happened. My guess? Martin is not suffering from severe writers block. He tried to hold out for a big payday and HBO went on without him.

1	I went in with low expectations but was pleased to see it was fun and engaging. I was especially happy to see they didn't make Lucy another Mary Sue.However, now I have watched the whole season I feel it's been let down by bar writing, especially in the area of character motivations, and without going into details that might cause spoilers I would say that the ending will absolutely fiddle with the timeline and canon of the games now - despite what the shows creators said about making an unrelated and original story in the official world.But with all that said I think it's worth a watch if you don't think about it too much - it has the dark humour of the games, the retro-futuristic look (mostly anyway) and it certainly kept me watching all the way through.	go low expectation please see fun engage especially happy see make lucy another mary sue however watch whole season feel let bar write especially area character motivation without go detail might cause spoiler would say end absolutely fiddle timeline canon game despite show creator say make unrelated original story official world say think worth watch think much dark humour game retro futuristic look mostly anyway certainly keep watch way

1	I never watched this show until recently when I was laid up after surgery. Binged on all seasons over a month and a half. The show has plenty of sex and violence but the narrative is rich even with well-developed characters. The show, in my opinion, peaked during mid season and the last two seasons have been very uneven. Too much filler. Season 8 has been somewhat of a disappointment. At this point I think the writers are simply to end with some sort of resolution for the many characters and storylines and it feels rushed. I think HBO's Westworld is superior (at least the first season) as well as Starz's Counterpart. As to who wins the iron throne, it is anybody's guess but my bet is on the Dragon Queen. Jon Snow is already dead and will probably die a noble second death saving his queen. One of the characters has to die and why not kill the one who was already dead?	never watch show recently lie surgery binge season month half show plenty sex violence narrative rich even well develop character show opinion peak mid season last two season uneven much filler season somewhat disappointment point think writer simply end sort resolution many character storyline feel rush think hbo westworld superior least first season well starz counterpart win iron throne anybody guess bet dragon queen jon snow already dead probably die noble second death save queen one character die kill one already dead
1	"Now I don't know if I'll watch anymore since they've killed 2 of my favorite characters for no reason other than cruelty. I realized partway into the last episode that George was going to depart the show. And given how the last several episodes had gone, Izzie might also have left for any number of reasons... simple, easy to understand reasons. After the brain glitching I felt the most likely departure would be that she retained none of her medical training, but any kinder story could have been written here. They already HAD a kinder - even heroic - exit for George formulated... then killed him with a bus. That the writers chose to be particularly cruel to the two people they had built up the most over the first five seasons, I'm unlikely to watch another episode. Seems to have been written by a rather sadistic crew that wants you to sympathise with and be tho most fond of the people they intend to mistreat in the worst ways possible. If there is some ""artistic"" point to that approach, I don't see it, and I don't appreciate it. No matter how many seasons are written on,, there's just no redeeming the writers on this. Best wishes to Bailey I hope you find a way to survive the series, but I'm not going to know. Well having her family torn apart in that last episode was a pretty bullying thing to do as well.

1	I haven't read the book, nor seen the Chinese series, which now I wish I had.This starts out ostensibly as a pure sci-fi piece and shows a lot of potential and promise.The premise with better than average production, direction, cinematography and finer details all make up for captivating, enchanting and curious viewing.The story begins with a series of flashbacks which set up the rest of the story: a victim of Mao's cultural revolution is recognised as a brilliant physicist and employed to work in a state of the art, top secret astronomy station, where she deduces how to amplify radio frequencies that results in a message from outer space, warning her not to respond, yet she does.The early episodes are replete with suspense, mystery and the overarching thrilling science fiction plot,which slowly reveals itself- until annoyingly, it meanders into territory exploring the sanctity of human life and love.Many of the characters, as previous reviewers have spotted, seem and feel deliberately cast by looks, tokenism and forced DEI, with the women largely playing the saviours, moral arbitrator's and ethical righteousness in the face of the war-mongering, unfeeling patriarchal establishment.Ultimately the story is about a race for survival between a distant alien species and ourselves. This forces humanity to look inwards, which is badly mishandled by the creators with the Oxford five serving as representatives of that inner search; resembling more of a soap opera than boldly exploring any existential philosophy or similar themes.They ( santi ) have already made contact and are able to recruit a small number of devotees who are dedicated to ensuring their safe arrival.Superior technology and communication is used to sabotage Earth's most cutting edge quantum physics projects and scientists in order for the santi to maintain their technological edge.A vetting process via a futuristic VA headset is used to recruit the best and brightest minds to join the small but powerful sect of followers led by Mike Evans, an entrepreneur ( Jonathan Pryce).The performances are adequate yet somewhat flat.Rosalind Chao and Jess Hong play their parts well with Benedict Wong and Liam Cunningham adding some mild humour, yet there really isn't any stand outs.The character of 'Auggie' played by Eiza González is one of the most unrealistic, irritating, repugnant and repulsive I've witnessed in awhile.Her constant pouting, tantrums and bitter solipsism makes her almost unwatchable.Coupled together with what South Park coined 'put a chick in it' serves only to detract and distract this viewer from connecting to any of the characters. She's not only unwatchable but unbelievable. Perhaps if she were twenty years older...A grave mistake was made focusing so much time on the human themes of love and value of human life when the initial premise made for much greater storytelling.It's not only trite, it assumes audiences are not able to follow a story based on hard science and philosophy of science-which should have been the main plot points, rather than the pointless wranglings about right and wrong which the protagonists keep falling into.Despite all of this series obvious flaws, it does have some interesting, redeeming moments making it a worthwhile watch.Those giving it a 10 with their ecstatic reviews And labeling those who vote down as idiots who just don't get it, fail to understand the gross mishandling of such a promising story and how frustrating that can be.In fact those who vote it down while recognising its potential probably do so with a heavy sense of disappointment and reluctant cynicism.	read book see chinese series wish start ostensibly pure sci fi piece show lot potential promise premise well average production direction cinematography fine detail make captivate enchant curious view story begin series flashback set rest story victim mao cultural revolution recognise brilliant physicist employ work state art top secret astronomy station deduce amplify radio frequency result message outer space warn respond yet early episode replete suspense mystery overarch thrill science fiction plot slowly reveal annoyingly meand territory explore sanctity human life love many character previous reviewer spot seem feel deliberately cast look tokenism force dei woman largely play saviours moral arbitrator ethical righteousness face war monger unfeele patriarchal establishment ultimately story race survival distant alien species force humanity look inward badly mishandle creator oxford five serve representative inner search resemble soap opera boldly explore existential philosophy similar theme santi already make contact able recruit small number devote dedicate ensure safe arrival superior technology communication use sabotage earth cut edge quantum physics project scientist order santi maintain technological edge vet process via futuristic va headset use recruit well bright mind join small powerful sect follower lead mike evans entrepreneur jonathan pryce performance adequate yet somewhat flat rosalind chao jess hong play part well benedict wong liam cunningham add mild humour yet really stand out character auggie play eiza gonz lez one unrealistic irritate repugnant repulsive witness awhile constant pout tantrum bitter solipsism make almost unwatchable couple together south park coin put chick serve detract distract viewer connect character unwatchable unbelievable perhaps twenty year old grave mistake make focus much time human theme love value human life initial premise make much great storytelle trite assume audience able follow story base hard science philosophy science main plot point rather pointless wrangle right wrong protagonist keep fall despite series obvious flaw interest redeem moment make worthwhile watch give ecstatic review label vote idiot get fail understand gross mishandle promise story frustrate fact vote recognise potential probably heavy sense disappointment reluctant cynicism

2	The series is so different from what an American or European eye knows. On the other hand, it's also so familiar and incredibly good. It is precisely this Japanese stranger that makes this series so exciting The scenery and costumes in particular are incredible and chosen with great attention to detail. Shogun maintains its high standard and skillfully conveys the cultural peculiarities of Japanese culture at the time. I'm incredibly excited about the story without any prior knowledge, Disney is finally bringing out a somewhat new series. The subtitles are a little annoying, but I got used to them pretty quickly.

2	In this 10-episode series we are led to side with the character of Toranaga, a Japanese lord whose life, and the life of everyone in his corner, is at risk at the hands of the other ruling regents. The way the show depicts Toranaga at first is the classic take on a strongwilled man, who is vilified because he is too much of a risk to the remainder of the ruling parties. The five men were supposed to rule in unison until the king comes of age, however, one man seems to go against the will of the other four and therefore is persecuted. We are led to believe that the four regents are the vile and egoistical ones, giving in to greed and foreign christian influence over the wellbeing of their own people. Lord Toranaga, on the other hand, supposedly goes against this, wishing to survive and bring prosperity with his vision.This carefully crafted image shatters in the last minutes of episode 8 and subsequently in ep 10. The man plays the underdog, pretends he is ready to give up so that his followers are all the more riled up and urge him to fight on. He gaslights his generals into signing an agreement to give up, he has his most trusted advisor and lifelong friend commit seppuku as part of his plan. He sacrifices lady Mariko into giving her life to him as well, so that he can free hostages who are on his side and manipulate the king's mother into assisting him. He then orders for the Anjin's ship to be burned and tortures the whole village, killing innocent people, pretending to be looking for the culprits of the burning, all as a twisted test to see how the Anjin would behave. He claims to be humble, to be ready to sacrifice himself for the good of the realm. He is not. He is ruthless, trecherous, absolutely obsessed with power, holding human life in no regard, killing people at whim. And the worst of it all, he will kill off anyone in his circle, be it his loyalists or regular villagers, just to prove a point. There is nothing noble about this man.This series leaves you wondering whether you have been rooting for the wrong side all along and feeling that all of this 10-hour investment has been wasted. Especially that, after you learn of Toranaga's villainy, there is absolutely no follow up to see how the other characters react to this man having his way and what the fallout of all this is to the general people.	episode series lead side character toranaga japanese lord whose life life everyone corner risk hand rule regent way show depict toranaga first classic take strongwille man vilify much risk remainder rule party five man suppose rule unison king come age however one man seem go four therefore persecute lead believe four regent vile egoistical one give greed foreign christian influence wellbee people lord toranaga hand supposedly go wish survive bring prosperity vision carefully craft image shatter last minute episode subsequently ep man play underdog pretend ready give follower rile urge fight gaslight general sign agreement give trust advisor lifelong friend commit seppuku part plan sacrifice lady mariko give life well free hostage side manipulate king mother assist order anjin ship burn torture whole village kill innocent people pretend look culprit burn twist test see anjin would behave claim humble ready sacrifice good realm ruthless trecherous absolutely obsess power hold human life regard kill people whim bad kill anyone circle loyalist regular villager prove point nothing noble man series leave wonder whether root wrong side along feel hour investment waste especially learn toranaga villainy absolutely follow see character react man way fallout general people

A couple hours later (like ep6, 7, and 8) I was hooked and sad there were no more episodes to watch. One of the better shows I've come across in the last few years.

That was until S8 completely destroyed the entire series. S8 ignores all 7 previous seasons of material and destroys everything the show has been building up to for 10 years. It is so heartbreaking that I am now in a depression. I used to recommend this show to everyone I know and now I can't anymore. The payoff just isn't worth watching. There is no point of watching the 65+ episodes of brilliance to get to the disastrous final season and be heartbroken. The most important episode...the Apex of the whole series...the one episode the entire show has been building up to for 10 years was absolutely terrible.

0	I found this unbelievably boring. None of the actors are stand out & the annoying bargain basement Richard Burton accent of the lead actor grates.The original casting in the 1980s tv series was knock down stellar with Lady Mariko practically carrying the whole series. This time round she looks & sounds like a flat toned American actress pretending to be Japanese.Lord Toronaga was played by Toshiro Mafuni in the original - no one could ever replace him. As for Lord Yabu, he was so larger than life I couldn't wait for him to show up on the screen in the original - Freddy Takai was amazing. All these actors were utterly believable even if the story was rolled out slowly.How can Shogun be boring??? Terrible script, uninspiring actors, non descript characters that's how. Go back & watch the original tv series if you want to really engage with this story.	find unbelievably bore none actor stand annoy bargain basement richard burton accent lead actor grate original cast tv series knock stellar lady mariko practically carry whole series time round look sound like flat tone american actress pretend japanese lord toronaga play toshiro mafuni original one could ever replace lord yabu large life wait show screen original freddy takai amaze actor utterly believable even story roll slowly shogun bore terrible script uninspire actor non descript character go back watch original tv series want really engage story

Or a social commentary... didn't work trying to be all of them. As a thick threaded telling of one of the genres, it may well have pulled this viewer deeper, instead, with its decision to be a mix, it simply left me floating on the surface, not particularly bothered, and not about to go diving deeper. Rape needs to be presented with care and consideration of how it will be perceived, here it just seemed to be added on to give a reason for the protagonist to be ""messed up"". There was no exploration or condemnation of that harrowing experience. It was just ""there""."	start really well great performance etc get confuse want comedy dark self dystopian dysfunction social commentary work try thick thread tell one genre may well pull viewer deeply instead decision mix simply leave float surface particularly bother go dive deep rape need present care consideration perceive seem add give reason protagonist mess exploration condemnation harrow experience
2	"Straight of the bat, there as some inconsistencies with the story, such as with the time periods and certain character placements within those periods but beyond that, the series is rather palpable in that regard. Oh, and expect to ignore the ""science"" in this show, because it makes almost zero sense... Perhaps that's intentional given the story... It's quite off putting when the physics of the show is literally contrary to how modern physics depicts it with literally no explanation as to why. You need a great suspension of disbelief to enjoy the show, particularly with how the Sun works.The only other criticism I could muster is that some characters suffer from being 2 dimensional, showing little to no deviation in their portrayal of said characters. It's not a train smash but I did find my self skipping those scenes but it was quite boring and detracting from what was an otherwise thrilling watch.I only wish the series took the liberty of expanding upon the story with what the Russian and American scientists initially discovered and their reaction to the discovery too. Since it wasn't just an exclusive broadcast to China."	straight bat inconsistency story time period certain character placement within period beyond series rather palpable regard oh expect ignore science show make almost zero sense perhaps intentional give story quite put physics show literally contrary modern physics depict literally explanation need great suspension disbelief enjoy show particularly sun work criticism could muster character suffer dimensional show little deviation portrayal say character train smash find self skip scene quite bore detract otherwise thrill watch wish series take liberty expand upon story russian american scientist initially discover reaction discovery since exclusive broadcast china

0	The Budget for this show was $153 million. You could of given any Fallout fan the budget and they would have made a better show, In fact, there already is a better fan-made Fallout show and it's called Nuka Break (Check it out).Obviously, when a video game show or movie gets made Fans are going to be upset because we already know it will be corporate slop that's not true to the game, so no one or myself is really that surprised. But, the Fallout universe is huge, many games across many years and a plethora of lore to work with.They could have made an awesome show from the source material, Instead we get politically correct virtue signaling in a post apocalyptic setting with a Fallout label slapped on it.It lacks the raw, gritty helplessness that the games are known for. This show is more Whimsical, and probably would have been better as a new, original IP without using the Fallout name.	budget show million could give fallout fan budget would make well show fact already well fan make fallout show call nuka break check obviously video game show movie get make fan go upset already know corporate slop true game one really surprise fallout universe huge many game across many year plethora lore work could make awesome show source material instead get politically correct virtue signal post apocalyptic set fallout label slap lack raw gritty helplessness game know show whimsical probably would better new original ip without use fallout name
1	"In Netflix's latest adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's classic viewers might find themselves both intrigued and perplexed. The show, a noir-esque rendition that certainly does justice to its visual aesthetics, unfortunately falters on more substantive grounds.Firstly, the casting choices present a glaring issue. Andrew Scott, portraying Tom Ripley, is noticeably older than his literary counterpart, a discrepancy painfully obvious in the show's crisp black and white visuals. The original novel, along with the acclaimed 1999 film, depicts a youthful ensemble of characters in their mid-twenties. However, in this adaptation, while Freddie (played by the talented non-binary child of Sting, Eliot Sumner) skews younger, the rest, including Tom, are markedly older. This age gap is more than a superficial oversight; it fundamentally alters the dynamics and relatability of the characters.Secondly, the series misses crucial plot elements that added depth to the original narrative. Both Highsmith's novel and the 1999 film subtly showcased Dickie Greenleaf as a charming yet fickle playboy, a detail that Marge Sherwood, his on-off love interest, is acutely aware of. This aspect of Dickie's character adds a layer of complexity to the storyline, especially during police investigations and Marge's reactions to Dickie's disappearance. Unfortunately, ""Ripley"" devotes considerable screen time to prolonged, albeit artistically shot, scenes, such as the one on the boat, at the expense of these crucial character dynamics. This narrative choice represents a missed opportunity to enrich the story with the original's subtleties.Lastly, the show falters in its depiction of Tom Ripley's transformation. In the novel, Tom's obsession with Dickie manifests in a gradual assumption of his identity, mannerisms, and even physical appearance. This metamorphosis is central to the plot and Tom's psychological journey. The series, despite ample runtime across its eight episodes, fails to convincingly portray this transformation. While there are instances of Tom impersonating Dickie, the depiction lacks consistency and depth, particularly in visual cues like Tom's hairstyle, which remains static throughout the series.Another notable issue is the series' altered and abrupt ending. Deviating from the original novel and film, this change diminishes the psychological complexity and moral ambiguity that are hallmarks of the Ripley narrative. The shortened conclusion leaves a sense of incompleteness due to the omission of the original's impactful closure.While the series has its shortcomings, the acting prowess of the Italian talent cannot go unmentioned. Their performances add a layer of authenticity and vibrancy to the show, capturing the essence of Highsmith's world with remarkable depth and nuance. Their contributions stand as a highlight in the adaptation, infusing it with moments of genuine emotion and cultural richness.In conclusion, while the series offers a unique take on the classic story, it's a take that, in many ways, strays too far from its roots, losing much of the original's charm and complexity in the process."	netflix late adaptation patricia highsmith classic viewer might find intrigue perplex show noir esque rendition certainly justice visual aesthetic unfortunately falter substantive ground firstly cast choice present glare issue andrew scott portray tom ripley noticeably old literary counterpart discrepancy painfully obvious show crisp black white visual original novel along acclaim film depict youthful ensemble character mid twenty however adaptation freddie play talente non binary child sting eliot sumner skew young rest include tom markedly old age gap superficial oversight fundamentally alter dynamic relatability character secondly series miss crucial plot element add depth original narrative highsmith novel film subtly showcase dickie greenleaf charm yet fickle playboy detail marge sherwood love interest acutely aware aspect dickie character add layer complexity storyline especially police investigation marge reaction dickie disappearance unfortunately ripley devote considerable screen time prolong albeit artistically shoot scene one boat expense crucial character dynamic narrative choice represent miss opportunity enrich story original subtlety lastly show falter depiction tom ripley transformation novel tom obsession dickie manifest gradual assumption identity mannerism even physical appearance metamorphosis central plot tom psychological journey series despite ample runtime across eight episode fail convincingly portray transformation instance tom impersonate dickie depiction lack consistency depth particularly visual cue like tom hairstyle remain static throughout series another notable issue series alter abrupt end deviate original novel film change diminish psychological complexity moral ambiguity hallmark ripley narrative shorten conclusion leave sense incompleteness due omission original impactful closure series shortcomings act prowess italian talent go unmentioned performance add layer authenticity vibrancy show capture essence highsmith world remarkable depth nuance contribution stand highlight adaptation infuse moment genuine emotion cultural richness conclusion series offer unique take classic story take many way stray far root lose much original charm complexity process
0	Really wasn't very interesting. I'd recommend not wasting your money on watching it if you can avoid it. The characters are great actors, but the plot line is actually very basic in the end. Good guy wants justice, bad guy wins. With so many stories of so many kingdoms, one would think something decent and happy was going on. Granted, they pop a wedding or two in now and then, but even those end up in massacre and death. So...I end my review with explaining the next chapters of the game: Part 1 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Part 2 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Part 3 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Part 4 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies. Part 5 - good guy struggles, good guy has no hope, good guy dies.

1	"Although I quite dislike Matt Damon, what was interesting about his ""talented Mr Ripley"" was the ingenuity of his plans and his impression skills (as far as I can remember). As much as I love the Fleabag priest, this Mr Ripley has no talent whatsoever. Doesn't plan ahead, his impressions sound just like himself (I mean the character - I do know the actor is Irish), and don't even get me started on his ""disguise"". He keeps getting away by fluke or by police incompetence, not by talent, which gave me a ""meh"" feeling (this is not a spoiler, I haven't watched how it ends yet). Casting wasn't great either inasmuch it would make more sense for the dilettante young men to be in their late twenties (late thirties tops). Also, the black and white cinematography seemed completely gratuitous to me. Didn't add anything to the story or to the experience of watching this series, actually it took away the expressiveness and the meanings that colors could convey. Despite all that, it's a watchable series, especially if you miss the priest as much as I do. And Lucio was quite entertaining too. Rated it 7 because IMDB doesn't allow me to rate it a 6,8."	although quite dislike matt damon interest talente mr ripley ingenuity plan impression skill far remember much love fleabag priest mr ripley talent whatsoever plan ahead impression sound like mean character know actor irish even get start disguise keep get away fluke police incompetence talent give meh feel spoiler watch end yet cast great either inasmuch would make sense dilettante young man late twenty late thirty top also black white cinematography seem completely gratuitous add anything story experience watch series actually take away expressiveness mean color could convey despite watchable series especially miss priest much lucio quite entertain rat imdb allow rate

I begin the recording and, a couple of minutes in, have to tune away because of the horrifically loud noise (some might call it music) idiots have added to the new shows. Remember when there were many efforts made to lower the heightened nuisance noise of commercials? Well, now we have that same nuisance added to a show that I would otherwise enjoy. Fire the idiots and the very poor management who put together an unbearable hiccup that neither adds nor, in any way, enhances the experience.The addition to tv shows of background music (even though much lower in volume than that in The Rookie) that overrides the dialogue seems to be a ""thing"" these days. It detracts from the story and most often drowns out the dialogue.

1	In the beginning of Grey's Anatomy, the show was very entertaining. The characters and the plot itself was unique. The show had so many surprises and entertainments that had viewers inclined to watch more. Additionally, the comedy in Grey's Anatomy was at its peak as well. However, as the show progressed, it started getting prolonged for no reason. For instance, the original characters of Grey's Anatomy have almost all left. The loss of the originals and the addition of new individuals make the show hard to watch. For instance, Cristina leaving the show could have led to the show ending, especially since the show was based on Cristina's and Meredith's friendship. Her leaving (and other characters) has definitely made me lose interest in the show. Especially now that Meredith is leaving, I hope that show ends on a good note since now it is does not give the vibes it gave from the beginning of the show.	begin grey anatomy show entertain character plot unique show many surprise entertainment viewer incline watch additionally comedy grey anatomy peak well however show progress start get prolong reason instance original character grey anatomy almost leave loss original addition new individual make show hard watch instance cristina leave show could lead show end especially since show base cristina meredith friendship leave character definitely make lose interest show especially meredith leave hope show end good note since give vibe give begin show
1	If you have seen the movie from 1999 with Matt Damon and Jude Law, there's not much new to be had here. The eight-part series is the exact same story with the exact same twists. In the series some things are left out however, like Dickie impregnating a local woman, who ends up killing herself.For example: In the movie the boat sequence lasts 4-5 minutes. In the series it lasts more than half an hour using a lot of filler shots and close-up shots of Andrew Scott looking intense.All actors do a great job, but I'm not buying the triangle of friendship, where one looks like a 50-year old (Tom), the other 30 (Dickie) and the third a teenager (Freddie). That's not good casting.The series is beautifully lensed and the black and white suits the noir atmosphere perfectly. But I would have loved some twists on a story I already know.	see movie matt damon jude law much new eight part series exact story exact twist series thing leave however like dickie impregnate local woman end kill example movie boat sequence last minute serie last half hour use lot filler shot close shot andrew scott look intense actor great job buy triangle friendship one look like year old tom dickie third teenager freddie good cast series beautifully lense black white suit noir atmosphere perfectly would love twist story already know
0	"I never want to be that person that says ""Books are still better"". But I'm being now, sorry.I love the books, they are pretty great.This show is not.Except the main essence of the plot, everything else is different.They apparently hate so much the first book that they rush past 60-70% of it in the first 3 episodes. And that is just sad.Something I don't think I ever saw in a book adaptation, is that they split the main character from the book into five people in the show. It's usually other way around. And it's done so ridiculous, they split a chinese scientist dad with a wife and a kid into a Beneton ad cliche - millenial team of a latino woman, asian woman, black man, chunky englishman and white dude with cancer. But even more bizzarely - those same characters then started to mutate into characters from the second book. I don't know what to think about it honestly.What I do know, there is no mystery, tension, thriller, only those characters, being dragged through main plot while they deal with their petty BS.You can fault chinese series for some things but they at least kept it fairly close to the first book and made an okay show, if not one a bit too long and complicated at times with some elements omited/whitewashed. But it worked.This is not that. It's worse compared to that show that came one year ago and it's far worse than the books it's ""loosely"" based on.A lot of people say Benioff/Weiss failed in finishing Game of Thrones because they had no source material to rely on so they improvised. Well they had it here and they still bungled it up. Most things are made subpar, acting, characters, plot is flatlined, even music is 10 shades of gray whatever stuff. A lot of things went unexplained or explained badly, brushed off, especially some core science stuff which play a big role in the plot. That somewhat shows what creators think about their audience.There is no sense of wonder, no amazement, no character development. It's not smart, funny, trippy or visually appealing - CGI is nothing to write home about. It's pretty lame and cliche filled affair tailored for modern western audiences that just consume and don't demand quality for their money. So, Netflix subscribers.I don't know, you can watch it, it's disappointing. You can watch chinese series, it's better, longer. But I would recommend books every time."	never want person say book still well sorry love book pretty great show except main essence plot everything else different apparently hate much first book rush past first episode sad something think ever see book adaptation split main character book five people show usually way around do ridiculous split chinese scientist dad wife kid beneton ad cliche millenial team latino woman asian woman black man chunky englishman white dude cancer even bizzarely character start mutate character second book know think honestly know mystery tension thriller character drag main plot deal petty bs fault chinese series thing least keep fairly close first book make okay show one bite long complicate time element omit whitewash work bad compare show come one year ago far bad book loosely base lot people say benioff weiss fail finish game throne source material rely improvise well still bungle thing make subpar act character plot flatline even music shade gray whatever stuff lot thing go unexplained explain badly brush especially core science stuff play big role plot somewhat show creator think audience sense wonder amazement character development smart funny trippy visually appeal cgi nothing write home pretty lame cliche fill affair tailor modern western audience consume demand quality money netflix subscriber know watch disappoint watch chinese series well long would recommend book every time

Got hyped up by Fallout 3 when Bethesda took over, played hundreds of hours in Fallout 4 and slowly lost my enthusiasm after 76 fiasco.Kinda sad, that such a huge franchise with such a rich lore ended up being downsized to incoherent flood of in-game references connected by yet another abysmal script. I have a feeling that writers haven't played anything other than fallout shelter before writing screenplay.Lots of things barely make any sense in the setting, especially when it comes to vaults and their inhabitants.It's passable as a rainy/snowy day time killer, but not something that I personally would consider a good film adaptation. Heck, some indie shorts on youtube did a better job at capturing a ""spirit"" of Fallout, while this show only focused on visually appearing ""fallout-y""."	long time fallout fan play crap fo back highschool enjoy fallout tactic get hype fallout bethesda take play hundred hour fallout slowly lose enthusiasm fiasco kinda sad huge franchise rich lore end downsize incoherent flood game reference connect yet another abysmal script feel writer play anything fallout shelter write screenplay lot thing barely make sense set especially come vault inhabitant passable rainy snowy day time killer something personally would consider good film adaptation heck indie short youtube well job capture spirit fallout show focus visually appear fallout

It was a very long time ago that I read Shogun...and perhaps a bit less time...that I watched the TV mini series (in the 80's, I believe). The novel and the TV mini series were excellent in every way. This 2024 version is not at all up to those standards. It's harsh and mean and without any of the class of the first mini series. There are some good performances, especially the person who plays Toranaga, but they are too few. The lead character, Pilot or Anjin, is aweful. He mopes around like a hulking monster. There are no redeeming qualities with this lead...as opposed to the novel and mini series. The dialogue is dyslexic and the plot is tiresome. Wish I could finish this version but I can't...it lacks style, it's too mean, and it's just plain dull.	unfortunately appear director producer writer must read novel long time ago read shogun perhaps bite less time watch tv mini series believe novel tv mini series excellent every way version standard harsh mean without class first mini series good performance especially person play toranaga lead character pilot anjin aweful mop around like hulk monster redeem quality lead oppose novel mini series dialogue dyslexic plot tiresome wish could finish version lack style mean plain dull

Mix of intelligence with emotional investment.Overall I thought it let the audience clearly understand the issues at hand, whilst giving the hopelessness of their situation.The quality of the production is good in both picture and sound.Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy political science fictions with an alien twist.	body problem interest series many thing right clunky sc ene read book see anti government revolution tone first part infeel come across little overtly blunt idea westernism highly suspenseful murder mystery along emotional relationship make series interest combination review comment keep suggest character unrealistic scientist cold logical like spock star trek experience scientist express series pretty spot mix intelligence emotional investment overall think let audience clearly understand issue hand whilst give hopelessness situation quality production good picture sound definitely worth watch enjoy political science fiction alien twist

2	I have to admit when I saw this new series come up as a recommendation on Netflix, I was highly skeptical. I very much enjoyed the 1999 Jude Law and Matt Damon film based on Patricia Highsmith's novel. That film, although a departure from its original source, was well done and brilliantly acted; adding (I think) A more human and relatable element to the character of Tom Ripley. I did read Patricia Hysmith's original novel, and found Tom Ripley to be a very cold sociopath, as (I'm sure) she intended.I am happy to say my skepticism was put to rest.Ripley the miniseries is absolutely brilliant!! Much truer to its literary source than the film adaptation from 1999, Tom is colder, more calculating and a true sociopath. Yet somehow, the filmmaker still makes him the antihero of the story.Andrew Scott does here (I think) the best work of his career, the nuance of his character in every little facial gesture, movement of the eyes, calculating soliloquies... his work here is nothing less than brilliantMany here are commenting and praising the cinematography, and I completely agree. Filmed entirely in black-and-white, With a simplicity and starkness that allows the nuances of performance, as well as every shot to blaze through the screen and transport the viewer in an Immersive experience to 1960's Europe. Every scene, every shot, every edit is well thought out and pieced together and stripped down to allow the performances to shine and transport us through every frame.I did read the novel many years ago, and I would say this is a very true adaptation. Bravo to brilliant performances and direction and cinematography.	admit see new series come recommendation netflix highly skeptical much enjoy jude law matt damon film base patricia highsmith novel film although departure original source well do brilliantly act add think human relatable element character tom ripley read patricia hysmith original novel find tom ripley cold sociopath sure intend happy say skepticism put rest ripley miniserie absolutely brilliant much truer literary source film adaptation tom colder calculate true sociopath yet somehow filmmaker still make antihero story andrew scott think good work career nuance character every little facial gesture movement eye calculate soliloquy work nothing less brilliantmany comment praise cinematography completely agree film entirely black white simplicity starkness allow nuance performance well every shoot blaze screen transport view immersive experience europe every scene every shoot every edit well think piece together strip allow performance shine transport we every frame read novel many year ago would say true adaptation bravo brilliant performance direction cinematography

The costumes, the sets, all of it is incredible. I am disappointed that the season is only 8 episodes long. By the end, I was debating picking up one of the games and playing it. I've disliked every Bethesda game I've ever played and would never have considered it had the show not been as good as it is. I wasn't necessarily a fan of the lead male character. His acting was great, but something was really missing there.

It's an ironic take on the Eisenhower period that takes the nuclear family a little too literally.It's entertaining to watch the contrast between humour and violence that resembles the Coen brothers' best work, whereby the humour is genuinely funny and the violence has real stakes.I was initially skeptical about this series. As a big fan of the games, it seemed like opportunistic studios just trying to capitalize on the ""video game to TV"" success of The Last of Us, but it's clear that between the big budget production, attention to detail and solid artistic choices (writing, acting and camera work all are exceptional), this is a passion project for Jonathon Nolan (brother of Christopher Nolan) and I think they've done a great job.Whether you're a fan of sci-fi, western, comedy, action/adventure, or just big, world building entertainment, this show has a bit of everything."	fallout great job capture unique tone make game great apocalyptic future suspend time time america ironic take eisenhower period take nuclear family little literally entertain watch contrast humour violence resemble coen brother good work whereby humour genuinely funny violence real stake initially skeptical series big fan game seem like opportunistic studio try capitalize video game tv success last we clear big budget production attention detail solid artistic choice write act camera work exceptional passion project jonathon nolan brother christopher nolan think do great job whether fan sci fi western comedy action adventure big world build entertainment show bite everything

1	"The show has a compelling pilot, and it's a fun watch at first. There's a bit of a slump in the middle of season one, but the season started and finished strong. I felt the writers really found their voice. They initially pair Nathan Fillion's character, John Nolan, with Lucy Chen. While an interesting pilot twist, the storyline lacked longevity, and the writers wisely move on to making the John-Talia interactions the center piece of the show.Then season two starts, and the Talia character is gone. I think this was a huge loss for Nathan Fillion's character - she was his counterbalance, and that's what made his car scenes compelling to watch. From then on, the show flounders on what to do with the titular character. They try to find a new character to pair him off with, but the magic is never recaptured. They try humanising him in a variety of ways, through his extremely bland son and his son's off-putting fiancée; his rich best friend who is almost always absent; the undercover cop turned cranky pregnant detective; his doctor girlfriend, and finally his firefighter girlfriend, who somehow also manages to be devastatingly bland despite being good at everything and having a sociopath husband.John Nolan becomes a more and more lighthearted character as the show goes on, but the jokes often fall flat and his charm runs thin, making him less relatable. It just doesn't click, I think because the character no longer has anyone anchoring him in reality.The most maintained and compelling character arc by far belongs to Tim, and how he navigates training Lucy. I think the writers realise this, because a lot of the episodes start revolving around them.Tim's unexpected approach to training rookie Katie Barnes (Katy O'Brian) was equally compelling, and also still centers around the rookie theme of the show, but the character leaves the show forever after one episode.John Nolan's character isn't the only character who gets saddled with uncompelling love interests - it's actually a hallmark of the show. I have no idea why the writers waste so much time giving everyone a bland wife or husband storyline. Angela Lopez and Wesley Evers are the most egregious example of this - the actors have zero chemistry, but the show forces it anyways. The fourth season especially is bogged down with silly side plotlines to give the Wesley character something to do. The writers then pull the exact same ""we work different parts of the justice system and act like enemies but we're actually attracted to one another"" storyline with Lucy Chen, and it's just as tedious the second time around.And then there's the very weird episode where they shoehorn in Niecy Nash's character as a rookie FBI agent and make her the main character for one day. I absolutely adore Niecy, but it felt like they were setting up a Rookie spin-off show with Niecy as the focus, only ?? Spin-off shows usually revolve around beloved existing characters in the show. Retconning Niecy's dad into the community center doesn't make her an existing character in this universe.The writing also becomes very heavy-handed in regards to intersectional issues like racism within the police force. I care about these issues and generally enjoy when they're explored in fiction, but by the third and fourth season the writing becomes so hamfisted that several scenes made me cringe.Overall, a show with a ton of potential, that's wasted because of directionless writing and way too much focus on pointless romance plotlines.I'm also worried why this show keeps losing main cast actors, especially Talia/Afton Williamson. She said it's because she experienced racism, and was harassed and assaulted on the show. By who? Is he still working on the show? Discovering why she left a really bad taste in my mouth, especially because the show pretends to champion human rights."	show compel pilot fun watch first bite slump middle season one season start finish strong feel writer really find voice initially pair nathan fillion character john nolan lucy chen interest pilot twist storyline lack longevity writer wisely move make john talia interactions center piece show season two start talia character go think huge loss nathan fillion character counterbalance make car scene compel watch show flounder titular character try find new character pair magic never recapture try humanise variety way extremely bland son son put fianc e rich good friend almost always absent undercover cop turn cranky pregnant detective doctor girlfriend finally firefighter girlfriend somehow also manage devastatingly bland despite good everything sociopath husband john nolan become lighthearted character show go joke often fall flat charm run thin make less relatable click think character long anyone anchor reality maintain compel character arc far belong tim navigate train lucy think writer realise lot episode start revolve around tim unexpected approach train rookie katie barne katy brian equally compel also still center around rookie theme show character leave show forever one episode john nolan character character get saddle uncompelling love interest actually hallmark show idea writer waste much time give everyone bland wife husband storyline angela lopez wesley ever egregious example actor zero chemistry show force anyways fourth season especially bogge silly side plotline give wesley character something writer pull exact work different part justice system act like enemy actually attract one another storyline lucy chen tedious second time around weird episode shoehorn niecy nash character rookie fbi agent make main character one day absolutely adore niecy feel like set rookie spin show niecy focus spin show usually revolve around beloved exist character show retconne niecy dad community center make exist character universe write also become heavy hand regard intersectional issue like racism within police force care issue generally enjoy explore fiction third fourth season write become hamfiste several scene make cringe overall show ton potential waste directionless write way much focus pointless romance plotline also worry show keep lose main cast actor especially talia afton williamson say experience racism harass assault show still work show discover leave really bad taste mouth especially show pretend champion human right

0	"I have not read the novel and I dived in the show with no preconceptions. Well, I was disappointed quite rapidly as the some of the elements of the story killed the interest I had for the show.So the Chinese had their own SETI project, that's fine. Then we see that Ye Wenjie makes contact with an alien being. I will pass on the fact that being able to decode a alien signal and translate it into a human language is done in a very short time (hours? Mins?). That was my first hic.Vera Ye's death is mysterious and her mother tells Jin that Vera did a very unusual thing before her death which was playing a VR game using a wireless helmet. Jin and Jack supposedly highly educated and smart people act, surprisingly, in the dumbest possible way. Instead trying to find out the origins of the helmet and its technology they are oblivious to all the warning they use it! Auggie tells them ""We don't have this technology"", ""that thing is hacking into your brain"" and THEY KEEP PLAYING WITH DAMN HELMET? Seriously! Now the sequence where Auggie uses the helmet for the first time in Episode 3 is supposed to convince us that the characters act in a sane and rational way. Well they do, except Jin and Jack but let's say the helmet may have turned them into addicts of the game. The others however, just let it go and leave the helmet with Jin and jack instead to studying as it seems to be one of the key elements of the puzzle.All those scientist mysteriouly dying or murdered aroung the world and only one guy is investigating the case? When you think that somebody is making the sky blink using morse code you put all the ressources you have on it!The show clumsily tries to get our attention on the game and its mysteries then on the Aliens. But It's hard to go past the ridiculous parts of the plot.To finish the idea of making the sky blink (they say universe in the show which is laughable). Does not make any sense for so many reasons that it would be too long to explain here. Let's just say that the stars we see are just a tiny portion of what our Galaxy. At least we know that the sky did not actually blink but they just point it out and do absolutely nothing about it."	read novel dive show preconception well disappoint quite rapidly element story kill interest show chinese seti project fine see ye wenjie make contact alien pass fact able decode alien signal translate human language do short time hour min first hic vera ye death mysterious mother tell jin vera unusual thing death play vr game use wireless helmet jin jack supposedly highly educate smart people act surprisingly dumbest possible way instead try find origin helmet technology oblivious warn use auggie tell technology thing hack brain keep play damn helmet seriously sequence auggie use helmet first time episode suppose convince us character act sane rational way well except jin jack let say helmet may turn addict game other however let go leave helmet jin jack instead study seem one key element puzzle scientist mysteriouly die murder aroung world one guy investigate case think somebody make sky blink use morse code put ressource show clumsily try get attention game mystery alien hard go past ridiculous part plot finish idea make sky blink say universe show laughable make sense many reason would long explain let say star see tiny portion galaxy least know sky actually blink point absolutely nothing

But as the series progressed, the writing started to fall. Sure, there were some pretty stupid Hollywood plots, however all was forgiven because it was leading somewhere. Now, it was all for nothing. The biggest adversary in TV history turns out to have absolutely no other purpose than finning out the northern army. And the death of the night king was lazy, pathetic and just sums up D&D's writing ability. I really enjoyed the ride, it made me read the books and history of ASOIAF, but the outcome does an absolute disservice to the entire fiction.

0	"There is so much in this story that could have been so very cool and interesting and so fresh to watch. But it completely falls flat in dialogue and attempting to push characters that are comically too cool for school while being pretty, oh and they are cosmologists and physicists and whatever else at the same time. It's just silly. I would laugh and finally found myself just skipping almost any scene with the Auggie character by the end, because it didn't matter to the plot usually and the actress just was not right for this role and couldn't hold up to it. Terrible casting and writing for her character overall.Eventually I realized you can largely just play the scenes with the Chinese actors and get the actual plot and move the story along and anything else is fluff. Pure fluff that involves people saying ""what's going on?"" Seven times or ""I didn't ask for this!"". I mean the level of selfishness even after these people know an entire alien population is coming to take over the world was truly western. It made me cringe for my culture. Just people whining or talking about nonsense until we cut back to the Chinese characters and finally things move along. I was pulling my friggin hair out by the right episode. Not all westerners are like this and especially not scientists. Who wrote this?Anyway, I think the book is very good and far more interesting that this confused and poorly written mess. Enough with the brooding and petulance at a big unfair world, could I please have characters that act like adults?

0	"In the beginning, this was an interesting medical drama that focused on a few first-year interns whose lives were intertwined. Interesting concept and initially was more focused on medical procedures with excellent writing and actors. Now, it's just a bunch of crappy, woke BS, with some medical drama interwoven in it. Since the ever-departing good actors (Justin Chambers, Patrick Dempsy, Jessica Capshaw, Sandra Oh, Eric Dane, Kate Walsh) have left, the ones that are left have crappy writing and little character development.Ellen Pompeo is a good actress, she has carried this show into the further seasons, but she's very much alone. The rest of the cast may be better actors than what the writing is allowing for them (Chandra Wilson, James Pickens Jr, Kevin Mckidd, Kim Raver) but that's about where it ends. The rest are like background or uninteresting characters that got moved to the forefront with the departures of the better actors.I wouldn't mind there being a character that calls out the other characters for their unprofessionalism in the workplace. The medical procedures and drama are masked with stupid, vapid arguments between characters who are either sleeping with each other (in the hospital at times,) or launching into some monologue about what things they're going through. While this (monologue) was cute for the Grey character to do, when others do it too, it makes it not as cute, it makes it annoying and immature. These are supposed to be smart grown-ups who make life and death decisions on the daily and they're being petty with each other, cheating on each other and bringing almost no redeeming qualities to the table.Now with the latest cast of characters, they have some brooding dude that's related to Amelia, a smart black woman who could be written so much better than she currently is, the actor, (Alexis Floyd) has the chops to carry this show if only the writing and her character development didn't suck. I don't care for most of the other characters, I can't stand the Amelia character, another whose acting chops could do more if given better material. Jo, Maggie, Levi, Link, Winston, Kwan, Jules, Mika, even Scott Speedman's character is just meh. I keep watching I guess because I want the characters to be better. I keep hoping that the writing will move from woke BS so something with weight, that the characters will be redeeming and the medical drama will unfold and be the focus, not juvenile inter-relationship crap.Don't get me wrong about the woke comment, I think this show has been a pretty good platform for social injustices and bringing to the forefront things like outdated blood donation policies, family decisions during a trying time, and the plight of black women in positions of leadership in the workplace. The writing now is just so ""end of the road,"" for a series, like they aren't even trying anymore. Bring in better writers and get rid of the weaker characters and this show may have a better chance at recapturing me.With the writer's strike, this may be a good time just to put this one out of its misery."	begin interest medical drama focus first year intern whose live intertwine interest concept initially focus medical procedure excellent write actor bunch crappy wake bs medical drama interweave since ever depart good actor justin chamber patrick dempsy jessica capshaw sandra oh eric dane kate walsh leave one leave crappy write little character development ellen pompeo good actress carry show season much alone rest cast may well actor write allow chandra wilson jam pickens jr kevin mckidd kim raver end rest like background uninteresting character get move forefront departure well actor mind character call character unprofessionalism workplace medical procedure drama mask stupid vapid argument character either sleep hospital time launch monologue thing go monologue cute grey character other make cute make annoy immature suppose smart grow up make life death decision daily petty cheat bring almost redeem quality table late cast character brood dude relate amelia smart black woman could write much well currently actor alexis floyd chop carry show write character development suck care character stand amelia character another whose act chop could give well material jo maggie levi link winston kwan jules mika even scott speedman character meh keep watch guess want character well keep hop write move wake bs something weight character redeem medical drama unfold focus juvenile inter relationship crap get wrong wake comment think show pretty good platform social injustice bring forefront thing like outdate blood donation policy family decision try time plight black woman position leadership workplace write end road series like even try anymore bring well writer get rid weak character show may well chance recapture writer strike may good time put one misery

Acting is above average and effects are good but the story hasn't grabbed me and the logic and ""science"" behind the storyline is somewhat flawed.For example how are 300 nuclear devices suspended in space in a stable line awaiting detonation and since the detonations appear to do close how does the first not knock the latter ones out of position. Also with the heatsets provided by the aliens, where are they made since the technology is hundreds of years in advance of earth's. If they are made by the aliens how did they travel 4000 lights years from the alien planet in the 50 odd years since first contact?"	watch whole season eagerly await season probably act average effect good story grab logic science behind storyline somewhat flaw example nuclear device suspend space stable line await detonation since detonation appear close first knock latter one position also heatset provide alien make since technology hundred year advance earth make alien travel light year alien planet odd year since first contact
0	The first several seasons of the show were stellar. They didn't follow the books to the letter, but that's to be expected. They showed most of the glorious twists and turns of the books in a glorious way and they made fantasy mainstream again.However, midway through, the writing started to falter. Cracks in the minds behind the screen started to become apparent. And in seasons 7 & 8, everything went downhill. Story lines were left hanging, main characters were ignored, important twists and plot-points were replaced with cheap jump-scares and obvious pseudo-twists. The moment D&D went off the books, their inability to write even a basic story-line became apparent...At this point I'd recommend the TV show to people only for the cultural value of knowing how bad it can get... I honestly believe that 50 years from now this show will be studied in college (if those still exist) as an example of bad TV writing... I only hope that George R. R. Martin manages to finish the books so that we finally get the end we've been waiting for...	first several season show stellar follow book letter expect show glorious twist turn book glorious way make fantasy mainstream however midway write start falter crack mind behind screen start become apparent season everything go downhill story line leave hang main character ignore important twist plot point replace cheap jump scar obvious pseudo twist moment go book inability write even basic story line become apparent point recommend tv show people cultural value know bad get honestly believe year show study college still exist example bad tv write hope george r r martin manage finish book finally get end wait
1	"As a computer scientist with a solid understanding of physics, I didn't find a single scientific explanation that made sense. The arguments are often centered around the notion that ""Science is broken"" or that ""the Universe is ignoring the laws of physics"" while the characters that are supposed to be highly talented Oxford students lose all scientific rigor simply because they are scientists and are expected to be skeptical and atheist by nature, leading them to deny everything like if they were very afraid to start thinking maybe god exists. At times, it seemed like a parody of skepticism and atheism from an overly dumb perspective.While I found it entertaining, I couldn't help but be put off by their depiction of a parallel world where all scientists are portrayed as idiots and the existence of god is their biggest fear."	computer scientist solid understand physics find single scientific explanation make sense argument often center around notion science break universe ignore law physics character suppose highly talented oxford student lose scientific rigor simply scientist expect skeptical atheist nature lead deny everything like afraid start think maybe god exist time seem like parody skepticism atheism overly dumb perspective find entertain help put depiction parallel world scientist portray idiot existence god big fear
1	"Full Disclosure: I have NOT played the game. I find dystopian-future-based storyline games boring. I'll admit that maybe I'm missing something, but repeatedly killing/maiming zombies/vampires/mutants/gov't agents ad nauseum just doesn't raise my dopamine levels.Having said that, I am 3 episodes into watching this show.I like the story thus far, and I am amazed at the sets (the detail, the size and the ingenuity that has gone into their creation). I find that the character development is also keeping me interested so far. And the dialog, characters, directing and editing are all good, IMO. I really enjoy the ""cameos"" of actors I like that have frequently popped up so far as well.The main 3 things that subtract from the the show to me are these - 1) it's pretty easy for me to figger out what's going to happen next (so far) - yawn...; 2) the lead character/heroine(?), while very well cast, scripted and acted, has something about her personality that makes me want to ram my fist into the screen and smack the 'holy skeet' out of her; and 3) the soundtrack of the 60's Country and Western tunes pushes me to my limits of endurance. Granted, that may be because my Dad constantly listened to this music when I was a kid; but I feel it is mostly because I only like this kind of music when I am really drunk and going thru a some kind of 'betrayal' in my life. It's definitely NOT a music genre I want to hear when I DON'T feel that way!So, to summarize, I am slogging my way thru this show.

0	No more to say than what everyone already knows. The last season, particular the last 3 episodes were an absolute embarrassment. Dan and Dave should never show their faces again. They have ruined what was looking to be an unbeatable TV show. But no. Words can't sum up how disgusted I am by the last season. Pathetic. Truly pathetic. The cinematography and acting was unbelievably good as ever of course, but the writing was that of a parody. I laughed throughout at the ridiculousness and moronisism of the writing. This doesn't even come close to how annoyed and nauseated by the deplorable attempt at writing this last season. D&D have spat in the faces of the actors, crew, fans, GRRM and the reputation and memory of the show. They should be ashamed of themselves, but I'm sure they're looking forward to scuttling off for the Star Wars money. I am angry beyond comprehension and can't begin to imagine how the actors who spent 10 years on this show feel to have this rushed collosal mess as their end to years of work. I am sick to my stomach that these men can call themselves writers. They are incompetent, imbecilic dunces. I will never watch this again.

0	"Fallout as a game has always had amazing lore and game design and being the person I tend to just naturally check reviews before watching a show to see consistent 5 stars and 97% rotten tomatoes. Is this a joke? Perhaps a collective prank just like morbius I honestly don't know.*spoilers from episode 1 and 2 below*The acting is awful but not just awful but the script these actors have to read from don't even help. Quite literally the worse dialogue I've had to listen too. I understand the concept that vault dwellers are naive but there is being naive and then being quite literally stupid with the huge lack of any survival instinct to the point where maybe the little genetic diversity due to them being all cousins has canonically made them all cognitively impaired. Lucy's ignorance is unbearable: giving her only water bottle to a complete stranger on the surface who looks like he would rob her for everything? This is way past her being simply naive, she's just an idiot. The dialogue between her and the ghoul was so cringeworthy I was ready to turn off the show right then, as I realised that maybe Lucy's stupidity may not be satirical.Going back to episode 1 when the raiders were killing the people of vault 33 with the exception of a few 33 vault dwellers putting in some effort to stopping them, majority did absolutely nothing. Not only was there no sense of urgency and lack of security (I mean as they were all fighting, two people were still carrying food on a tray casually oblivious to the shooting of guns and the screaming? Something that was heard even from Lucy all the way in her room with the door locked).Maximus....honestly it's like the show wants me to hate these characters how can someone with even little screen time be so annoying. The scene between him and the cult leader during his interrogation was once again a hard watch. He's not even interesting , he's not likeable, he's probably cried more than he's spoken and he's a terrible knight. Talking about the knights (the guys in the power armour) they are obviously shown to be these intimidating/strong and trusted fighters for the brother of steel yet when one of them comes in contact with a mutated bear resorted to the ""act dead"" approach and had to rely on his squire with just a pistol to take it down for him. Pay in mind this is the same knight who was saying ""I just what to shoot something right now"" and dropping off the helicopter early just to be a complete embarrassment. What's more stupid is that as Maximus was going to stim him so he didn't die the knight in the power amour saw this as an opportunity to absolute incinerate maximus for no reason despite maximus being the one to decide his survival and the one who saved him in the first place. I thought these guys underwent vigorous training and even some education yet the chosen knights all share a singular brain cell apparently.This show is awful. The acting is awful. Dialogue is awful. I really don't care about Lucy or Maximus to be honest they are both equally unlikeable and I really don't understand how the reviews on this show are high considering the terribly non-engaging plot and awful creation of 2D characters.Don't watch it it's not worth your time."	fallout game always amaze lore game design person tend naturally check review watch show see consistent star rotten tomato joke perhaps collective prank like morbius honestly know spoiler episode act awful awful script actor read even help quite literally bad dialogue listen understand concept vault dweller naive naive quite literally stupid huge lack survival instinct point maybe little genetic diversity due cousin canonically make cognitively impair lucy ignorance unbearable give water bottle complete strange surface look like would rob everything way past simply naive idiot dialogue ghoul cringeworthy ready turn show right realise maybe lucy stupidity may satirical go back episode raider kill people vault exception vault dweller put effort stop majority absolutely nothing sense urgency lack security mean fight two people still carry food tray casually oblivious shoot gun scream something hear even lucy way room door lock maximus honestly like show want hate character someone even little screen time annoy scene cult leader interrogation hard watch even interest likeable probably cry speak terrible knight talk knight guy power armour obviously show intimidate strong trust fighter brother steel yet one come contact mutate bear resort act dead approach rely squire pistol take pay mind knight say shoot something right drop helicopter early complete embarrassment stupid maximus go stim die knight power amour see opportunity absolute incinerate maximus reason despite maximus one decide survival one save first place think guy undergo vigorous train even education yet choose knight share singular brain cell apparently show awful act awful dialogue awful really care lucy maximus honest equally unlikeable really understand review show high consider terribly non engage plot awful creation character watch worth time
1	I originally had this amazing series 10/10 but downgraded it to 6/10 purely on season 8.Up until season 8 it was gripping with the great war looming and the throne contenders lining up. All seemed to be going great until the end of episode 3. The night king meets his demise and sets the final episodes up for the last war. What did it bring us? Bewilderment!Rhaegal the dragon taken down by one Scorpion arrow yet Drogon flies through an entire fleet and fortress equipped with an arsenal of scorpions.Two of the main characters Cersie and Jamie flattened by rubble, what a let down to see these two beneath bricks when they have been arguably two of the best characters in the entire show.No Cersie Sansa face off which everyone was expecting and a prophecy that tells John he is the rightful king which leads to him taking the life of Danerys only to end his character back where he started being a nothing north of the wall while Bran, who's done virtually nothing for 8 seasons, given the crown!???How could they possibly have got this so so wrong?	originally amaze series downgrade purely season season grip great war loom throne contender line seem go great end episode night king meet demise set final episode last war bring we bewilderment rhaegal dragon take one scorpion arrow yet drogon fly entire fleet fortress equip arsenal scorpion two main character cersie jamie flatten rubble let see two beneath brick arguably two good character entire show cersie sansa face everyone expect prophecy tell john rightful king lead take life danery end character back start nothing north wall bran do virtually nothing season give crown could possibly get wrong
1	I started watching this a few months ago and thoroughly enjoy it. I have just started season 5 and I can already feel it going downhill as some characters just get super annoying. The worst is Meredith and Derek with their issues. Meredith behaves badly towards Lexie all the time and only cares about her stupid relationship with Derek- which has been the same thing for the last 4 seasons where they constantly breakup and make up... Derek is arrogant and cant stick to one woman and he keeps blaming Meredith for everything wrong with their relationship when he was wrong in more than one way as well.Dr Hahn is annoying, the way she treated Yang was wrong and even though she was reprimanded regarding this, it was still painful to watch. Lexie annoys me too because she thinks she knows everything and when she read the others files and stole from the hospital it made me dislike her character even more.I like the other characters and their growth, Addison by far improves the most and is actually a really nice person when she gets back from LA.The show is good, the medical miracles are unbelievable and there's a lot to learn but I feel they start dragging eventually and the plot eventually becomes nonsensical.	start watch month ago thoroughly enjoy start season already feel go downhill character get super annoy bad meredith derek issue meredith behave badly towards lexie time care stupid relationship derek thing last season constantly breakup make derek arrogant can not stick one woman keep blame meredith everything wrong relationship wrong one way well dr hahn annoy way treat yang wrong even though reprimand regard still painful watch lexie annoy think know everything read other file steal hospital make dislike character even like character growth addison far improve actually really nice person get back la show good medical miracle unbelievable lot learn feel start drag eventually plot eventually become nonsensical
2	I told my niece who's also watching the show, it's slow but still great. It took me back to House of Cards, where every moment is tense, important, and a masterclass of acting and directing. FX continues to prove they are not just the home of movies but excellent tv. Shogun provides a true experience to old Japan and it's culture; the sets are beautiful, the cast is intentional with every word and movement, the director provides a depth and understanding to each characters feelings and thoughts yet can still leave one guessing. The old culture shows us that everything we do is meaningful and how much weight a single word or stare actually means. Also, I'm a sucker for flashbacks and when they are used correctly it brings so much more depth to characters and situations. This show allows us to watch as if we were listening to an audio book, and they are illustrating what's happening as we listen. I would like more action as the true action Stan I am but they provide realism to how battles occur, they take time and planning.	tell niece also watch show slow still great take back house card every moment tense important masterclass act direct fx continue prove home movie excellent tv shogun provide true experience old japan culture set beautiful cast intentional every word movement director provide depth understand character feel thought yet still leave one guess old culture show we everything meaningful much weight single word stare actually mean also sucker flashback use correctly bring much depth character situation show allow we watch listen audio book illustrate happen listen would like action true action stan provide realism battle occur take time plan

1	I was bored for the first three episodes. Kind of like the game, the lameness of vault life and the initial leaving of the vault is slow. The story did a good job of building up the mystery of the vault experiments. I loved the ghoul character (props to Walton Gibbens). They did a really good job of sticking to the source materials (the games). I almost felt like I was playing the next fallout game while watching. The lead did an amazing job of being both the naive vault dweller and a capable survivor. My only advice to the team is to speed up things a bit. I am looking forward to the next season!	bore first three episode kind like game lameness vault life initial leave vault slow story good job build mystery vault experiment love ghoul character prop walton gibben really good job stick source material game almost feel like play next fallout game watch lead amaze job naive vault dweller capable survivor advice team speed thing bite look forward next season
1	"What they did was using a B&W version of a classic story well filmed with the best cast possible is not compelling enough to surpass the Talented Mr Ripley. All three characters just falls short to present a engaging game of manipulation, deceit and intense thriller which is the underlying foundation of the story.With the aforementioned story filmed in Positano which demonstrated the allure and beauty of an Italian town was perfecto for the original story. Then they tried to shoot Ripley in Atrani with an equally quaint setting but fails to capture the story using B&W only. I struggled to find this captivating in the first three episodes. You can try shoot the blue of ocean as hard as you like but you'll never capture the azzura of the blue Italian coast using black & white. You can clearly see the difference when equally shown how it was done with The Eqauliser with Denzel Washington and Fanning shot in almost exactly the same location but in colour. Even the white of the settings aren't as well done.However from episode 4 it starts to make sense when city shots in Rome and the various architecture in the big cities presented the dramatic story and the darkness of Tom Ripley. But it still didn't come across as convincing as the Matt Damon. The three just didn't gel for me in Ripley.Italian cast and cinematography in big cities were excellent in most scenes. I really just wanted to see the ending by this point and hoped it was just a ""who done it"" crime story but no, they leave you hanging a bit for perhaps season 2."	use b w version classic story well film well cast possible compel enough surpass talente mr ripley three character fall short present engage game manipulation deceit intense thriller underlie foundation story aforementione story film positano demonstrate allure beauty italian town perfecto original story try shoot ripley atrani equally quaint set fail capture story use b w struggle find captivate first three episode try shoot blue ocean hard like never capture azzura blue italian coast use black white clearly see difference equally show do eqauliser denzel washington fan shoot almost exactly location colour even white setting well do however episode start make sense city shot rome various architecture big city present dramatic story darkness tom ripley still come across convince matt damon three gel ripley italian cast cinematography big city excellent scene really want see end point hop do crime story leave hang bite perhaps season
1	I like Nathan Fillion. Everybody likes Nathan Fillion. He was the star of the legendary tv show, Firefly and the movie it spawned, Serenity. Great stuff.But this show is lame and filled with cliches. None of these actors are believable cops. And I can see that the shills are out and handing out 10's like they're going out of style. lolThe police procedural all police procedurals need to be measured against is Southland. And this one is not even close.	like nathan fillion everybody like nathan fillion star legendary tv show firefly movie spawn serenity great stuff show lame fill cliche none actor believable cop see shill hand like go style lolthe police procedural police procedural need measure southland one even close
1	I'm only two episodes in so bear with me, but the thing I've noticed so much is the smoking. There seems so much of it at a time where in the UK less than 20% of the population smokes, much lower the younger you are, and definitely not in any type of workplace. It makes London feel quite Sandmanish. Apart from that I agree that the main character seems unable to express real emotions other than a uniform aggrieved look. I will continue to watch as I have been drawn in a bit, the video game does seem an interesting addition to the plot, and clearly a winking universe has some value, but I'm still going to guess that the average cigarette lighting per episode will continue at a mark of four plus.	two episode bear thing notice much smoke seem much time uk less population smoke much lower young definitely type workplace make london feel quite sandmanish apart agree main character seem unable express real emotion uniform aggrieve look continue watch draw bite video game seem interest addition plot clearly wink universe value still go guess average cigarette light per episode continue mark four plus
0	"It's missing all of the mistery, intrigue and thrill of the books. The characters, if they aren't removed they have different personalities and roles that are just worse. Here we have a group of ""academics"" that act more like teens from stranger things and dress like NY models and are all basic arquetypes. The sarcastic one, the reluctant hero, the clown, the sensitive one, the cynic... Really, you could take these characters and throw them in Stranger Things, or bring those here and they would fill each other's roles perfectly. It would be better with those characters here. At least the stranger things characters are deeper. In this show none of the characters have actual development.The pacing is just bad, there is no buildup for anything so the reveals all fall flat. It feels like if the creators thought that everyone had already read the books so there was no need for mistery or intrigue. The story seems to be on a rush, but they certainly have time for bad melodrama, gotcha moments and unfunny ""funny"" scenes. The science is butchered, simplified, instead of showing theories creatively they literally have people do exposition like a professor at physics 101.Of course Netflix did The Three-Body Problem lite for teens, that's their target audience. What a disappointment. At least this show led me to discover the chinese adaptation, which is miles better and has respect for the source material, not just its characters, but its ideas and atmosphere."	miss mistery intrigue thrill book character remove different personality role bad group academic act like teen strange thing dress like ny model basic arquetype sarcastic one reluctant hero clown sensitive one cynic really could take character throw strange thing bring would fill role perfectly would well character least strange thing character deep show none character actual development pace bad buildup anything reveal fall flat feel like creator think everyone already read book need mistery intrigue story seem rush certainly time bad melodrama gotcha moment unfunny funny scene science butcher simplify instead show theory creatively literally people exposition like professor physics course netflix three body problem lite teen target audience disappointment least show lead discover chinese adaptation mile well respect source material character idea atmosphere
2	Having not read the book prior to watching this is probably an advantage. While it retains many of the cultural revolution parts, the main bits are in the UK. Purists may not like this but I think for western viewers it makes sense.It is really well shot, the moral and scientific conundrums are good and while Westernised it doesn't have the usual Western tropes of good guys and bad guys, everyone is a bit of each and each has it's own perspective and rationality.The story goes along at a good pace, and most of the characters are interesting and well acted. The only one so far I have little interest in is Saul.What helps is both the pacing but also some unexpected turns, well unexpected for me.It is definitely more cerebral than most sci-fi these days, and as much as I liked the peripheral, this is a lot better.So I am sure purists won't like some of the transition to the wrst, Incel scifi nerds will do their head in at the multicultural/diverse cast and your average viewer will probably struggle with the fact you have to think and the fact no one is clean skin, it is definitely one of the best new shows of 2024.Hell it has even got me to buy the books, though I will read after watching, so as not to ruin both with preconceptions.	read book prior watch probably advantage retain many cultural revolution part main bit uk purist may like think western viewer make sense really well shoot moral scientific conundrum good westernise usual western trope good guy bad guy everyone bite perspective rationality story go along good pace character interest well act one far little interest saul help pace also unexpected turn well unexpected definitely cerebral sci fi day much like peripheral lot well sure purist like transition wrst incel scifi nerd head multicultural diverse cast average viewer probably struggle fact think fact one clean skin definitely one good new show hell even get buy book though read watch ruin preconception
2	Having read the original book, and remembering the original TV miniseries, this has so far done a really credible job. Location are great stand ins, actors are doing an incredible job. It does not move overly fast and not to many confusing flash backs. However, just a few things keep it from the 10, I would love to get it. Unlike the original series the show is dark, not as bright in coloring if that makes sense. The other problem is the subtitles. While the teen in movies is to use native language with subtitle, having to read the almost all the time, distracts from being able to sit back and enjoy the film itself. If you lie having to read your shows, it's perfect.	read original book remember original tv miniserie far do really credible job location great stand in actor incredible job move overly fast many confuse flash back however thing keep would love get unlike original series show dark bright color make sense problem subtitle teen movie use native language subtitle read almost time distract able sit back enjoy film lie read show perfect
1	It's been said before but Game of Thrones is Outstanding... That is for the first four series and part of the fifth.If you have not seen this series ever, a quick word of warning! Unless you enjoy watching programs that are so powerfully portrayed that they become a passion only to then have it all torn away in a rushed and totally disappointing series finale then Game of Thrones is the series for you.I honestly could not enjoy the first five series anymore, I was truly passionate about it and devoted weeks to the program, I read the books and purchased the merchandise and now I wish I hadn't of bothered.The worst is that the characters that I had spent eight years getting to know became caricatures of themselves.The cast is fantastic, it's truly acted well, the production was fantastic if a little poor with its use of CGI towards the final series but unfortunately this is a series that was plagued with poor writers (D&D) that seem that they could not escape fast enough.Series eight is abismal. Anyone who hasn't seen it I would warn away, if you need to then act as if series 5 was the finale, otherwise the outcome will just make you angry	say game throne outstanding first four series part fifth see series ever quick word warn unless enjoy watch program powerfully portray become passion tear away rush totally disappoint series finale game throne series honestly could enjoy first five series anymore truly passionate devote week program read book purchase merchandise wish bother bad character spend eight year get know become caricature cast fantastic truly act well production fantastic little poor use cgi towards final series unfortunately series plague poor writer seem could escape fast enough series eight abismal anyone see would warn away need act series finale otherwise outcome make angry

When asked about the very hot scene she had with Patrick Dempsey she said ""he is like a brother to me. I just wanted the kiss and the scene to be over with as quickly as possible."" I cannot believe her unprofessional thoughtlessness in saying those words. Doesn't she know that her romance with Mcdreamy is a huge draw for the show? How could she ruin that fantasy for all the viewers? Now, I cannot think of any scene between them as real. So I hope their tryst ends once and for all this third season. I sincerely hope the network has strong words with her for her careless comments. In fact, I wish I had never seen that interview and or that her comments were cut. For me, it has ruined her credibility as an actress. I expected better of her. I am extremely disappointed in her as a star."	absolutely horrify see ellen interview candid moment season finale air ask hot scene patrick dempsey say like brother want kiss scene quickly possible believe unprofessional thoughtlessness say word know romance mcdreamy huge draw show could ruin fantasy viewer think scene real hope tryst end third season sincerely hope network strong word careless comment fact wish never see interview comment cut ruin credibility actress expect well extremely disappoint star
0	A piece of garbage. Four episodes featuring improbable video games made with a $30 graphics engine, personal telenovelas, and the official declaration that the new enemy to denigrate is the Chinese. Episodes 5 and 6 are not bad, but then it falls into oblivion. Stereotyped characters, clichéd lines, questionable acting, and clichés everywhere. The good, the bad, the ugly, the professional.The story itself could be interesting, with some novel aspects, but the format is indecent. Entire episodes focus on the characters' family affairs, reminiscent of Friends. If you don't have the budget, don't attempt science fiction. Eight hours wasted, with only three or four interesting moments. Too few for seven hours.BTW a lot of smoking people.

1	"The series is pretty good, and I like some of the characters a lot (Nathan Fillion is great) but the problem I have with most of it is they bend over backwards to make the male characters kinda okay but ALL of the female characters are badass, perfect, and right all the time. They pretty much all come off like the same character. There's one who is a little different, but she's still somehow magical in all things.New girl who isn't a cop? Don't worry, she's probably a navy seal, mathematics genius, artistic savant.It's actively distracting from the quality of the show. Realistically dialing back the preaching and social commentary and the show would rocket up to 8-9.Here's an example which isn't really too spoilery: Guy gets shot, woman has baby, they check with one another and he says something innocuous and she says ""The correct response is that childbirth wrecks havoc on a woman's body and is very traumatic"" Then the scene basically ends. There's no point to that kind of commentary other than to point out that women can be badass and have it all and need to correct men at all costs. I can't actually recall a SINGLE time where a man and a woman disagreed and the man was right (according to the writers)Then you have well rounded characters who grow with the show and some interesting plot lines which aren't all just recycled from other shows. I keep remembering how much I like the show, then a new season comes out and it's somehow even MORE preachy than the last one and I slog through it for the good parts."	series pretty good like character lot nathan fillion great problem bend backwards make male character kinda okay female character badass perfect right time pretty much come like character one little different still somehow magical thing new girl cop worry probably navy seal mathematic genius artistic savant actively distract quality show realistically dial back preach social commentary show would rocket example really spoilery guy get shoot woman baby check one another say something innocuous say correct response childbirth wreck havoc woman body traumatic scene basically end point kind commentary point woman badass need correct man cost actually recall single time man woman disagree man right accord writer well round character grow show interest plot line recycle show keep remember much like show new season come somehow even preachy last one slog good part
2	"I am a massive fan of the game. And have gone through New Vegas more times than I should admit. But, the embodiment and spirit is alive and well through the eyes of Lucy McLean (Ella Purnell) a vault dweller who hasn't had to experience real adversity in life.If you've seen ""Blast From The Past"" (1999) a lot of this will be familiar. Though not as dark, it took the simple sweet naive character of Brendan Fraser and put him in real world Los Angeles. Same here. Except MUCH darker.The humor is dark as well. What director Jonathan Nolan did so well is to incorporate a sense of futility in the lives, similar to game play.The lighting and camera work are spot on to the game. You can tell they REALLY studied it. A lot of places, if you've played the game, will seem very familiar. But also, it's just different enough where you don't roll your eyes thinking it's all fan service. He integrates small things like Cram and Nuka Cola with such ease, it's almost like the meme where Leo DiCaprio keeps pointing at the screen to get your attention.The eye popping primary colors of the 50's/60's era is in full swing. If you can't tell the difference between film and digital, this puts your eyes to ease. Clearly this was a film shot movie. Glossy in texture, they lean into the fringe edges.Not that any viewer would intellectually care, but you really feel the Wasteland.Again, if you played the game, you know how many worlds they can explore here.' Actress Ella Purnell plays the wide-eyed vault child perfectly. She's sweet and wholesome in a newly brutal world. Similar to Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Leona Huxley in ""Demolition Man"" Though not necessarily excited for a bygone era.The characters she encounters only beefs up the idea of how over her head she's gotten herself into.The setup does feel a little rush. It begins with just absolute brutality. Yes, this is introduced. But, it really plays like the game. Where violence is dismissed quickly. If you haven't played, it's going to be a little off-putting. But it does make sense. It took me off guard for a moment. The idea is to get that open world feel and this series does it perfectly.This is one of the video game series I am absolutely excited to see continue.

1	The show was complex and hard to watch. Just as a fellow human you don't want anyone to go through mental illness. Personally I also hate the amount of abuse suffered by the main character as well. Why though he does he just keep making bad choice after bad choice? A lot of it blamed on his want of something more and what he was willing to endure to get it but I'm not sure I buy it. It feels like something else is just under his surface. Maybe in time he will reveal more of his story. I do applaud his keeping his stalker's identity a secret and allow her to try and get the help she so desperately needs. I would be curious to know more of her back story and why she became so obsessed with other people. The first 4 episodes were, for me, the best of the series.	show complex hard watch fellow human want anyone go mental illness personally also hate amount abuse suffer main character well though keep make bad choice bad choice lot blame want something will endure get sure buy feel like something else surface maybe time reveal story applaud keep stalker identity secret allow try get help desperately need would curious know back story become obsess people first episode good series

Have they actually read the book?Ripley himself is meant to have charm, the quality of a good conman, sadly he has none. It's totally unbelievable that Dickie would invite this man to lunch, never mind stay with him. Whilst I loved Andrew Scott's character in Fleabag, so he's clearly a good actor but totally wrong for this part.The fridge in Dickie's apartment has more charisma than either Dickie himself or Marge and don't get me started on Freddie. I can't say whether it was bad casting, scriptwriting, acting or directing, but it was just wrong. Do we really have so few talented actors with abit of swagger to pull ""Freddie"" off?Now, I'm sure some other reviewers will claim to be cinephiles and wax lyrical about the ""dark symbolism"" of the series, but surely the point of a series is to entertain and this didn't.I wanted to like it I really did, but sadly the cast was completely wrong, the script boring and cinematography a crime."	actually generous give starswell hour life get back whist appreciate dark storyline drab bore also italy central character plot ripley like miscast every single character director actually make italy look glamorous grimsby offence grimsby cast director actually read book ripley mean charm quality good conman sadly none totally unbelievable dickie would invite man lunch never mind stay whilst love andrew scott character fleabag clearly good actor totally wrong part fridge dickie apartment charisma either dickie marge get start freddie say whether bad cast scriptwrite act direct wrong really talente actor abit swagger pull freddie sure reviewer claim cinephile wax lyrical dark symbolism series surely point series entertain want like really sadly cast completely wrong script bore cinematography crime
1	Just finished watching final of 3 body problem. Bit of a crap cliff hanger ending. And how annoying was that young Latino actress who played the nano tech scientist. The worst actress I've seen in years. All she did was pout her lips and look like a bored plank of wood. She must have been sleeping with the director to get that part. Maybe spend more of the budget on better actors, than on expensive locations and cgi.Some of the cast seemed too young for the roles and weren't totally believable. The cgi was good though and the seasoned British cast's characters were likeable and believable.Otherwise it held my attention and hopefully season 2 will improve.	finish watch final body problem bite crap cliff hanger end annoy young latino actress play nano tech scientist bad actress see year pout lip look like bore plank wood must sleep director get part maybe spend budget well actor expensive location cgi cast seem young role totally believable cgi good though season british cast character likeable believable otherwise hold attention hopefully season improve

Do they really exist? Is it all a ""scam""? Are we playing into their hands?The ""humans being humanities best ally and worst enemy"" is quite on target as well.It is nice to have to actually think about motives, players, actions, and ""hints"" dropped along the way. Also, it's nice to think about these creatures in a non-humanoid way and really stretch the mind of what they could be. Bi-pedal humanoids is so last decade...Do the aliens exist? Can they not lie?

2	This is the 6th reiteration of the absorbing fictional story of Tom Ripley. Of the 5 earlier versions, I was able to watch The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) starring Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow.This film is a series which gives it ample time to explore the complicated character that is Tom Ripley. And Andrew Scott totally inhabits his role as Ripley, a really talented conman. Scott delivers the goods, so to speak.It's a mesmerizing crime thriller helped a lot by its beautiful locales: from Atrani in the Amalfi Coast, to Rome, Palermo and Venice.It's also interesting, casting-wise, that John Malcovich, who started in Ripley's Game (2002) plays a cameo role as Reeves Minot, a questionable art dealer and forger.Dakota Fanning and Johnny Flynn play crucial supporting roles, not to mention the Italian detective Mauricio Lombardi who's effective in his role as the determined Pietro Ravini.This is an excellent movie which is binge-worthy on a particularly hot weekend.	th reiteration absorb fictional story tom ripley early version able watch talente mr ripley star matt damon gwyneth paltrow film series give ample time explore complicate character tom ripley andrew scott totally inhabit role ripley really talented conman scott deliver good speak mesmerize crime thriller help lot beautiful locale atrani amalfi coast rome palermo venice also interest cast wise john malcovich start ripley game play cameo role reeve minot questionable art dealer forger dakota fan johnny flynn play crucial support role mention italian detective mauricio lombardi effective role determine pietro ravini excellent movie binge worthy particularly hot weekend
1	I was a big fan of Game of Thrones ever since it first aired on HBO. However, after waiting for two years, I (as probably also a lot of others) felt that the season didn't rise up the rest of the show. I believe the writers and producers didn't do the show justice and rushed the story. In these 6 episodes and pretty much destroyed most of the major character lines. It took 7 seasons for these complex story lines to evolve, just to be shattered in 2 episodes. That being said, taking in consideration that season 8 is a part of GOT, I don't believe anymore that the show deserves the 9.5 stars.	big fan game throne ever since first air hbo however wait two year probably also lot other feel season rise rest show believe writer producer show justice rush story episode pretty much destroy major character line take season complex story line evolve shatter episode say take consideration season part get believe anymore show deserve star
2	This masterpiece of a series is completely unique from the movie, and really elicits its own distinctive film noir vibe both in cinematography and dialogue. Purposeful yet subtle performances by all involved; Andrew Scott is absolutely perfect for this role.I haven't seen a TV series interpreted from a film source this well since Hannibal, where Mads Mikkelsen was also perfectly cast and gave an unforgettable performance.What else can be said about this series? A bit of a slow burn, but the pacing is completely suitable, and allows for a bit more fleshing out and development of the characters. Although I love the vibrant colors along the coast of Italy as much as anyone, I feel the choice to use a monochromatic palette here really enhanced the mood and atmosphere of the story.Top notch production in all aspects!	masterpiece series completely unique movie really elicit distinctive film noir vibe cinematography dialogue purposeful yet subtle performance involve andrew scott absolutely perfect role see tv series interpret film source well since hannibal mad mikkelsen also perfectly cast give unforgettable performance else say series bite slow burn pace completely suitable allow bite flesh development character although love vibrant color along coast italy much anyone feel choice use monochromatic palette really enhance mood atmosphere story top notch production aspect

1	I love this show but I have to be honest, the quality has been dipping since the start of series 4. Afton Williamson, who played Officer Bishop, left suddenly before season 2 aired and she was written off on that seasons first episode. At the start of season 4, Titus Makin Jr who played Officer Jackson suddenly left and so his character was killed off with an extra standing in. That's two black actors who left without fully explaining why. It's very worrying.The show itself is fantastic but the quality is dropping during season 4. It feels like it's been made by a totally new team and the exceptional actors are suffering. Bad storylines and annoying side characters (The annoyingly perfect Simone Clark because she was a Guidance Councillor).The first three seasons are amazing. I hope season 5 saves it.	love show honest quality dip since start series afton williamson play officer bishop leave suddenly season air write season first episode start season titus makin jr play officer jackson suddenly leave character kill extra stand two black actor leave without fully explain worry show fantastic quality drop season feel like make totally new team exceptional actor suffer bad storyline annoy side character annoyingly perfect simone clark guidance councillor first three season amaze hope season save
2	Have played the games since #1 and I think it hits the right tone and aesthetic. The games have shifted and evolved with time, but I'm surprised at how many other commentators claim the series isn't dark enough or too funny. All the Fallouts were weird *especially* the original isometric ones (1 and 2). The Brotherhood of Steel, the vault dwellers, raiders, and quirky side characters are all true to the games. The over the top gonzo violence and the retrofuture dystopia are also straight from the game. The series song choices of 50s crooners set to a new context also is true to the game. The weird macguffin story setting the vault dwelling protagonist out on a quest to the surface (a quest she really doesn't understand the context for) is also totally fallout.So it works. This is fallout. They nailed the vibe spot on and the story and characters are well cast.	play game since think hit right tone aesthetic game shift evolve time surprise many commentator claim series dark enough funny fallout weird especially original isometric one brotherhood steel vault dweller raider quirky side character true game top gonzo violence retrofuture dystopia also straight game series song choice crooner set new context also true game weird macguffin story set vault dwell protagonist quest surface quest really understand context also totally fallout work fallout nail vibe spot story character well cast

2	It's no secret that the show has maybe dropped in recent seasons however, I think a big reason for this is because a lot of the original cast were gone after S11. People grew an attachment to these actors and the characters they portrayed but I still believe that the show is very good and has become very in touch with real life problems!The actual show itself is incredible right after episode 1 you realise how good a show Shonda has created and she still continues to do so. So emotional you will laugh, cry and be pissed but you will fall in love with it, no doubt.The show hasn't yet deterred me away and I have stayed interested enough to rewatch it several times.

It's dissapointing to see a how good it had began in the first season and how boring it went in the second season.I did like the effects and the settings. The actors do a good job, but the writers are uncreative and waste the talent of the actors.So kurzgesagt: The main story is an interessting idea but the stories for the episodes are just copied from other serieses. A lot of convenience plotpoints and a lot of dumb decisions of the character. You can basically watch, how the characters do stuff to help the plot 🙄 The actors, the effects and settings are good.	bore episode copy series dissapointing see good begin first season bore go second season like effect setting actor good job writer uncreative waste talent actor kurzgesagt main story interesste idea story episode copy seriese lot convenience plotpoint lot dumb decision character basically watch character stuff help plot actor effect setting good

1	Not really sure why this show get a rating of 8 here on IMDB.The show is pretty entertaining but most of the characters are really unlikeable. Arrogant and annoying.Angela constantly feels the need to show off her position of power by behaving extremely arrogant towards her ''boot''.Jackson starts off the first episode making sure his superiors know from the beginning his dad fills an important function in the hopes of creating some kind of advantage.Tim is a downright annoying bully who abuses his position as a police officer and trainer.In one of the first episodes he degrades and cusses out a bunch of immigrants in front of his ''boot''.He involves his ''boot'' into personal problems and in a moment of anger he decides to provoke a bunch of bikers so they'll give him a reason to punch a few of then so he can get rid of his anger, once again, in front of his ''boot''. Absolutely toxic, which only makes his arrogance more misplaced.Such a shame that Rookie Blue (a similar tv show with way more likeable characters) got cancelled, only to get replaced with a show like this.This show reminds of me How To Get Away With Murder; an ok (but cliche) show but too much annoying characters to fully enjoy it. Shame.	really sure show get rat imdb show pretty entertain character really unlikeable arrogant annoy angela constantly feel need show position power behave extremely arrogant towards boot jackson start first episode make sure superior know begin dad fill important function hop create kind advantage tim downright annoy bully abuse position police officer trainer one first episode degrade cuss bunch immigrant front boot involve boot personal problem moment anger decide provoke bunch biker give reason punch get rid anger front boot absolutely toxic make arrogance misplace shame rookie blue similar tv show way likeable character get cancel get replace show like show remind get away murder ok cliche show much annoy character fully enjoy shame
1	"On its own merits this is a decent show. We'll developed world, well developed characters, truly excellent production values and good actors. Where it majorly falls down is in being a Fallout show.Transitioning anything from an interactive to a passive medium never really works, but this only has the veneer of the fallout universe. It ignores all the lore, and everything that would make it more ""fallouty"". Ghouls don't sound like ghouls, established lore is ignored or contradicted and nothing is added to justify it.If this was a totally new franchise it would be a solid 8 out of 10. The associations to fallout drag it down significantly, as the tv and the games can't be judged independently. When the TV claims to steer so close to the source material its total disregard for it needs to be factored in.Watch it if you've never played the games, and watch it if you have but just pretend it's not fallout."	merit decent show develop world well develop character truly excellent production value good actor majorly fall fallout show transition anything interactive passive medium never really work veneer fallout universe ignore lore everything would make fallouty ghoul sound like ghoul establish lore ignore contradict nothing add justify totally new franchise would solid association fallout drag significantly tv game judge independently tv claim steer close source material total disregard need factor watch never play game watch pretend fallout

0	I had to create an account to express my anger at this adaptation. I will applaud it on its visuals, but I cannot give a dime for its writing nor canonicity. If you've never played a Fallout game before, or casually played Fallout, then yes, I can safely recommend this show for you as, on its own, is entertaining and is capable of being a satisfying watch, excluding some of the bad writing which could bother you. However if you are one of those people who've been interested in Fallout's world for a long time then there's a high chance you'll be disappointed by how Bethesda changes Fallout's west coast lore to retcon levels.Onto my criticisms. I mentioned the bad writing, of which I can tell you two cases of, one in episode 1 and another in 2. The first problem I had is with its introduction to our trouble. Apparently Vault 32's inhabitants had been all killed by a group of raiders who then dressed as them and yet nobody in Vault 33 was able to recognize during their trading session that these people looked nothing like the original inhabitants of the people they frequently contacted for trade? And in episode 2, alongside with its depiction of the Brotherhood accepting outsiders into its ranks (which it never did outside of Fallout 3 and even they had a major problem with it), the plot becomes suspiciously convenient by having the Brotherhood Knight act like a brutish idiot and land in the middle of nowhere just so they could stumble upon the leftovers of one of the other main characters. Onto the canonicity of the show, its egregious. The NCR is destroyed, for some reason in 2277 even though it was shown in New Vegas the NCR was still alive and well in 2281. And now their remnants have turned into a crazed cult. Ghouls are, once again, depicted as being able to survive without needing to drink or eat, I blame Fallout 4 for this. The Brotherhood, for some reason, conscripts outsiders whilst simultaneously being religious technology hoarders. And they no longer act isolationist, this is not okay because these guys aren't some excommunicated off shoot of the Brotherhood, they are the HEAD of the organization.Seriously, I would've given this show a 6/10 if I didn't care so much about the original games, but because I hate Bethesda so much I cannot give an ounce of support to this series. In my eyes, it failed.	create account express anger adaptation applaud visual give dime write canonicity never play fallout game casually play fallout yes safely recommend show entertain capable satisfy watch exclude bad write could bother however one people interest fallout world long time high chance disappoint bethesda change fallout west coast lore retcon level onto criticism mention bad write tell two case one episode another first problem introduction trouble apparently vault inhabitant kill group raider dress yet nobody vault able recognize trade session people look nothing like original inhabitant people frequently contact trade episode alongside depiction brotherhood accept outsider rank never outside fallout even major problem plot become suspiciously convenient brotherhood knight act like brutish idiot land middle nowhere could stumble upon leftover one main character onto canonicity show egregious ncr destroy reason even though show new vegas ncr still alive well remnant turn craze cult ghoul depict able survive without need drink eat blame fallout brotherhood reason conscript outsider whilst simultaneously religious technology hoarder long act isolationist okay guy excommunicate shoot brotherhood head organization seriously would give show care much original game hate bethesda much give ounce support series eye fail
2	What a rollercoaster. We were glued to it from the first episode and then came episode 4. Was not expecting that!!! Ended up watching every episode, had to watch every episode.It's so raw and funny... really funny!! And then heart breaking, uncomfortable viewing that you can't help but watch and try to understand.The characters are relatable, the acting is spot on and the story just keeps twisting and turning.It almost makes you want your own stalker but then at the same time gives you the absolute fear that a stalker would choose you.Life is tough and my life is better for watching this.Need to watch it again. You need to watch this now!! Be prepared though. Especially episode 4. You are not prepared. You have been warned.	rollercoaster glue first episode come episode expect end watch every episode watch every episode raw funny really funny heart break uncomfortable view help watch try understand character relatable act spot story keep twist turn almost make want stalker time give absolute fear stalker would choose life tough life well watch need watch need watch prepare though especially episode prepare warn
1	The first episode okay...then it just got into the story of a gay guy in denial. I mean you are dating a transwoman...you might be gay. You meet a guy that I guessed was gay before they finished their first dialogue in the bar. Then he knows the guy is basically raping him while he is drugged out and keeps coming back...gay much? Yeah the plot at this point just got boring...drugs, gay guys, rape, drugs gay guys rape...wash rinse repeat. I couldn't get through the entire third episode. I mean if you are gay with a rape fetish...then this is the show for you!

0	So let's start by stating that I've never played the games so I'm writing this as someone who is coming in cold to this world and these characters.I thought that I could watch Walton Goggins in anything, but after half of one episode then had to revise that idea.These observations are mild spoilers for the first half hour, but not for the season.So, the first five minutes where nobody in the house notices the intense flash of a nuclear bomb detonating was odd since it was pretty damned bright.Then a raid where the victims were still reacting with surprise 5 minutes after it started.Then another few scenes in a training camp leading up to a completely baffling promotion.Finally some poorly scripted cartoon like villains digging up Goggins.Maybe there's a reason that this seemed so poorly written and directed that fans of the game might understand, but it seemed like a very amateurish attempt to wring something from a bit of gore and a bit of lore that has completely escaped me.Shame, because I'm a big fan of cartoon like gore and also science fiction.Maybe this will do it for you but it certainly didn't do anything for me.	let start state never play game write someone come cold world character think could watch walton goggin anything half one episode revise idea observation mild spoiler first half hour season first five minute nobody house notice intense flash nuclear bomb detonate odd since pretty damn bright raid victim still react surprise minute start another scene train camp lead completely baffle promotion finally poorly script cartoon like villain dig goggin maybe reason seem poorly write direct fan game might understand seem like amateurish attempt wre something bite gore bite lore completely escape shame big fan cartoon like gore also science fiction maybe certainly anything
1	This is outrageous, how come the Japanese speak their language and then when comes to speak Portuguese they speak English?I am Loving the story, quite interesting visuals and costumes but by not speaking português makes the show not an accurate story and lazy production.I can't wait to see what's coming up but I doubt it will get any Portuguese language at all.What struck me is that nowadays there is so much tension about multiracial and equality and now we see this happening it's a kind of offence by not speaking the right language. Can you imagine if the British spoke American? Or the other way around?	outrageous come japanese speak language come speak portuguese speak english love story quite interest visual costume speak portugu make show accurate story lazy production wait see come doubt get portuguese language strike nowadays much tension multiracial equality see happen kind offence speak right language imagine british speak american way around

2	Shogun stands out as a rare gem in today's television landscape. Gone are the days of sprawling epics that delve deeply into a foreign culture. This series is a magnificent exception, weaving a masterful narrative rich in the tapestry of Japanese customs and traditions. It's not just about sword fights (though there are some!), but rather a captivating exploration of leadership, loyalty, and the intricate dance between those who rule and those who serve. Be prepared to be surprised by the lengths some will go to in the pursuit of power and the unwavering dedication of others. If you crave a show that goes beyond the clash of steel and offers a deeper, more nuanced story, then Shogun is a must-watch.	shogun stand rare gem today television landscape go day sprawl epic delve deeply foreign culture series magnificent exception weave masterful narrative rich tapestry japanese customs tradition sword fight though rather captivate exploration leadership loyalty intricate dance rule serve prepare surprise length go pursuit power unwavere dedication other crave show go beyond clash steel offer deep nuance story shogun must watch

After nine episodes just to have a major character sacrifice herself for nothing and we never learn what happens to anyone else. That's just weird. Why would they stop it there? I've never read the book -- is that how it ends? I might never have started watching if it was going to end so cimpletely inconclusively. I mean all those other hostages in the locked room and that's it. I just don't get why they stopped there. It's like a dirty trick on the audience. Who lived, who died, what happened, who cares???

2	I don't really write reviews, I'm a lurker. But I grew up with Fallout and I have somewhat dreaded what this series could end up being. I did not like Fallout 4. I ignored Fallout 76. But I shall speak my piece for those who care to partake.First, I have some issues with the presentation visually. It feels quite plastic. There are parts that feel so CGI that it grinds my gears. Secondly, some character choices seem convenient rather than logical. Thirdly I would have liked further development of some.But in the end I surrender. They did this the way it should be done. This show does Fallout in a way that games as a medium should not, they actually made a show that added to the universe in a pleasant way. I'm not here to spoil anything, so I won't elaborate further. But if you like the games, and we're talking 1 to New Vegas, you should se this. At least, you should know that you needn't woory about doing so.Yeah. It's the bomb.And I had a blast.	really write review lurker grow fallout somewhat dread series could end like fallout ignore fallout shall speak piece care partake first issue presentation visually feel quite plastic part feel cgi grind gear secondly character choice seem convenient rather logical thirdly would like development end surrender way do show fallout way game medium actually make show add universe pleasant way spoil anything elaborate like game talk new vegas se least know woory yeah bomb blast
1	3 body problem is a passable series to watch but can also leave you a little frustrated.The acting from the older actors, Wong, Chao, Pryce and Cunningham are excellent and steal the scenes. Jess Hong does a decent job too. But, the others, not so much.The other characters I found dull and irritating. I didn't care for them and I didn't enjoy their stories. I didn't feel any empathy for them and this can only attributed to one of two reasons, the acting or the writing/adaption from the books.Some episodes are okay, one is fantastic, but most felt like fillers.When I saw it was the writers from Game of Thrones who infamously butchered the show and ruined it, I was hesitant to watch this new series.The finale is very underwhelming and left me feeling that I just wasted my time on all the episodes. It was not fulfilling, or left me on a cliffhanger or begging for a season 2.If you got time to kill, it's an okay series.	body problem passable series watch also leave little frustrate act old actor wong chao pryce cunningham excellent steal scene jess hong decent job other much character find dull irritate care enjoy story feel empathy attribute one two reason act write adaption book episode okay one fantastic feel like filler see writer game throne infamously butcher show ruin hesitant watch new series finale underwhelme leave feel waste time episode fulfil leave cliffhanger beg season get time kill okay series
1	"I came into this without any expectations. Having watched The Talented Mr Ripley so long ago that I barely remembered it, I took the story as it was told without comparison to the movie or the books.The acting was great, the black and white cinematography very striking, and the understated humor many scenes didn't go unnoticed.I got to the last episode, prepared for an interesting conclusion and waiting to see how he would pull this next con off. But then came the most disappointing part of the entire series. Not only didn't the inspector recognize him through a very thin disguise, using the same voice and mannerisms as ""Richard Greenleaf"", but he also failed to recognize THE SAME ASHTRAY! It put me right off the series at that point.Still, 7/8ths of the series was good, so I rated it a 6 overall."	come without expectation watch talente mr ripley long ago barely remember take story tell without comparison movie book act great black white cinematography strike understate humor many scene go unnoticed get last episode prepare interest conclusion wait see would pull next con come disappoint part entire series inspector recognize thin disguise use voice mannerism richard greenleaf also fail recognize ashtray put right series point still ths series good rat overall
0	...but didn't stay. Possibly the biggest problem is that the trailer gives the idea this is a comedy at any level. It even feels like one, for a little while in the beginning. I couldn't handle it beyond one and a half episodes, it was just getting worse and worse in terms of how disturbing the story is. Three stars for great acting. Minus seven stars for Netflix misdirection. It may be good, but not for me (or really for anyone who wants to be entertained or stay in a good mood.) Perhaps the perfect choice if I was looking for a story of how bad one's life can turn out when one makes the worst possible decisions in any given situation. I wasn't looking for that.	stay possibly big problem trailer give idea comedy level even feel like one little begin handle beyond one half episode get bad bad term disturb story three star great act minus seven star netflix misdirection may good really anyone want entertain stay good mood perhaps perfect choice look story bad one life turn one make bad possible decision give situation look
2	This is actually an incredibly good show with a good solid storyline that keeps viewers entertained and engaged. Now with that said I really kind of hate shows and movies with the whole retro future type thing it really kind of annoys my senses. I'm pretty much all future futuristic all the time still what they did with this show is nice. It's enough gore to keep people satisfied with some what real world challenges(if the world was post apocalyptic/post war) kind of a way the writers did an excellent job telling Fallouts story and the actors played they're parts brilliantly there was no cheeky over acting and the roles that some of the actors had were done pretty well they had dark comedy and enough guts and mayhem to have a good melody. It's not jump out of your seats action with huge expensive explosion(that I like too) it's just good cinema.	actually incredibly good show good solid storyline keep viewer entertain engage say really kind hate show movie whole retro future type thing really kind annoy sense pretty much future futuristic time still show nice enough gore keep people satisfy real world challenge world post apocalyptic post war kind way writer excellent job tell fallout story actor play part brilliantly cheeky act role actor do pretty well dark comedy enough gut mayhem good melody jump seat action huge expensive explosion like good cinema
2	"I have been watching faithfully this new series just out of curiosity at first, then out of a sort of devotion even. It really jumped out at me though on the last episode to question exactly what sort of category this program fits into. I felt mostly all along that it fit into the drama/comedy category, but a few things along the way and especially the season finale made me wonder if the show is not intended as a ""farce"" or ""spoof"" or at least leaning that direction in its comedic aspects. Consider all the professional lines the characters cross in every episode--easily several times each episode. Examples are obvious, such as talking about their personal business when patients are being treated (fully conscious patients too!); or the constant sexual involvements besides Meredith's and Dr. McDreamy. But the final episode bordered on hilarity with the conclusion of the interns being put on time-out, lined up in the hall like so many school children, and being put to task planning a PROM of all things, like any hospital could ever have time for THAT! The patient whose doctor had pledged to marry him but missed being at his death bed while trying on different prom dresses, and who ultimately lays in bed beside him after he died, was SO over the top, and so FAR across every boundary, I had to conclude that I was supposed to be laughing at this. In fact I did. My mother and sister, however, fell for it all and boo-hooed. I would be curious to know if anyone else thought the final episode was meant to be funny, or was I just in some strange state of mind? sawznhamrs@sbcglobal dot net to me!

The build up of the Whitewalkers war fizzled into nothingness. I am Up to episode 4 ,It seems that the story is just appers to be a vehicle for femisim, the Dragon Queen doesnt want to let John Snow (The rightfull heir to the throne ) have the top job, he crumbles and like a besotted child gives all up for love, how ridiculous! Arya Stark (another woman) stabs the Head Whitewalker and kills him, whitewalkers gone......that was a letdown. Now because John Stark tells his sisters the truth and says swear not to tell a souls, why? because we are family???? They aren't family, hes the rightfull heir to the Targarian Clan. This story is rubbish. Oh and then we switch to Cersei (KIngslayers girlfriend/sister) another strong and powerful woman, is going to destroy them all to get the Iron Throne! Killing all her innocent subjects in the process....how dumb. Oh and Kingslayer is riding back to be by his sisters side after doing the Big chick who he Knighted????????

1	"In today's law enforcement shows are becoming to be more politics and less real police work, in many of the shows sometimes you feel you are watching tv lecture and not tv drama. The tv writers today don't know how to write it well. In ""The Rookie"" it feels different, we still have the idea that cop work in the 2020's is different than it used to be but it feels natural and not preaching. There is dealing with race and over policing but it feels the writers don't show it in black and white they give us the gray area. There is good and bad in everything. Nathan Fillon is great as a 40 years old rookie, he can do comedy and drama well with the rest of the cast. The plots are good up until the season 4 opening (the action in Guatemala was ridiculous) but the rest is good.Also need to say that when two of the lead actresses got pregnant the writers just wrote in the show and didn't try to hide it with coma and other ridiculous stories that other tv shows do stupidly."	today law enforcement show become politic less real police work many show sometimes feel watch tv lecture tv drama tv writer today know write well rookie feel different still idea cop work different use feel natural preach deal race police feel writer show black white give we gray area good bad everything nathan fillon great year old rookie comedy drama well rest cast plot good season open action guatemala ridiculous rest good also need say two lead actress get pregnant writer write show try hide coma ridiculous story tv show stupidly
2	The original series (in Chinese) have always been criticized for its character building but it's exceptional in terms of setting up such a fascinating concept about universe and captivating story plot. At least in the first season, this show corrected the shortcoming of the book and made the characters way more relatable and genuine, Meanwhile appealed to a wider audience while kept its essence. Great job. The story is way bigger than earth, human and our universe. And I agree with most reviews, the visual shows the budget. Can't wait for the second season. I hope Netflix continues this series.	original series chinese always criticize character build exceptional term set fascinate concept universe captivate story plot least first season show correct shortcoming book make character way relatable genuine meanwhile appeal wide audience keep essence great job story way big earth human universe agree review visual show budget wait second season hope netflix continue series
2	The beauty of the book is it enables the reader to imagine the scenes, how different character will look like, sound like. Agree that this is far from what i imagined but it gots the right ingredients, and ive to say, comparing to other sci-fi tv show, the story and the scope of this story is truly extrodinary.One major issue is that things seem to be moving too fast, the wallfacer suddenly announced at the end might be confusing for audiences who haven't read the book (it is again, a very unique concept and one might mind it quite counter-intuitive: giving so much power to 3 person); i think the cast is alright, nth too extraordinary for the Ox 5 but i really love Wade's character.Hope there will be season 2 and it can show the real scope of the book with a little bit slower pace.	beauty book enable reader imagine scene different character look like sound like agree far imagine got right ingredient I ve say compare sci fi tv show story scope story truly extrodinary one major issue thing seem move fast wallfacer suddenly announce end might confuse audience read book unique concept one might mind quite counter intuitive give much power person think cast alright nth extraordinary ox really love wade character hope season show real scope book little bite slow pace

0	"First of all I understand that this show isn't exactly how police do their jobs, it's not a reality show or documentary, it's a TV series/show.Still the first 2 seasons were promising and very well casted, scripted and filmed.The last 1-2 seasons the show got derailed and I read more reviews of people who agree.The Bradford and Chen (who gained a lot of weight btw, check her outfits this season and then compare it with the first 2 seasons) angle is so predictable. They had a moment in the previous season when Officer West passed away and they always seem to end up together but the ""undercover"" operation with two (not one but TWO) lookalikes is lazy writting in my opinion.I am sad to see the show going downhill. The mistakes they make in how the police approaches certain situations changed a lot, more and more procedures are being violated and where is the IA (Internal Affairs) when you really need them?Maybe it's for the best that IA (Internal Affairs) isn't there anymore otherwise nobody would keep their jobs, especially after Guatemala.Cops who got shot at aren't protected anymore (as opposed too the first two seasons) but the strangest thing for me is that people who have been through so much together still feel the need to lie to each other or withhold information. Like seriously? That's just too easy to use as a way to create a situation that could easily be avoided.(for example the whole Wesley/Angela/Elijah situation).It was sad to see Jackson getting killed and written off the show like that. He was a cool and likable person.What I also noticed is the whole woke introduction, which I don't mind but sell it better, make it more believable. Hell, even put a transgender cop in there, I don't care, as long as it's believable.The two-parter with FBI agent Simone is a perfect example of how this show changed and it was also the first time I skipped through a couple scenes. If this were to be a comedy show I would probably not watch it but at least it would be believable. Her introduction wasn't that bad but when she stepped in the meeting like that, came too late, opened her mouth with all those people there, higher ranked officers was unrealistic.It made me sad to see the show this sloppy. When you look at the show in season one and two, there is no way anyone would get away with something like that, she would get suspended and as a trainee/rookie, you are off the force.Because of episodes like in the last season it's hard to see what Nolan, Chen and Jackson had to go through in the first 2 seasons to make it as a cop and be taken seriously. With all the amazing arrests, human lives saved, advices given and cases solved those three still had a hard time becoming a P2 cop. And now.... well, now it's lost it's value to become a cop.The show has 3 options here;-needs to go back to the well written, acted and filmed series it was (my favourite option)-cancel the show-rename it because this is not The Rookie from season one and two, this way you are just fooling the audience."	first understand show exactly police job reality show documentary tv series show still first season promise well cast script film last season show get derail read review people agree bradford chen gain lot weight btw check outfit season compare first season angle predictable moment previous season officer west pass away always seem end together undercover operation two one two lookalike lazy writting opinion sad see show go downhill mistake make police approach certain situation change lot procedure violate ia internal affair really need maybe good ia internal affair anymore otherwise nobody would keep job especially guatemala cop get shoot protect anymore oppose first two season strange thing people much together still feel need lie withhold information like seriously easy use way create situation could easily avoid example whole wesley angela elijah situation sad see jackson get kill write show like cool likable person also notice whole wake introduction mind sell well make believable hell even put transgender cop care long believable two parter fbi agent simone perfect example show change also first time skip couple scene comedy show would probably watch least would believable introduction bad step meet like come late open mouth people high rank officer unrealistic make sad see show sloppy look show season one two way anyone would get away something like would get suspend trainee rookie force episode like last season hard see nolan chen jackson go first season make cop take seriously amaze arrest human live save advice give case solve three still hard time become p cop well lose value become cop show option need go back well write act film series favourite option cancel show rename rookie season one two way fool audience

1	It's not a bad series with some interesting writing and casting. But, also some very boring writing and ridiculous casting.Liam Cunningham is great! Benedict Wong is absolutely fantastic! And, Jess Hong is also pretty good in her role.However, Eiza González is an absolutely terrible actress. Constant scenes with her poor, ridiculously forced acting of her crying or moping with her buck teeth hanging out, lips gaping open waiting for the insects to fly into her mouth. She so poor that it's just shameful casting with how good Cunningham and Wong are. Just a terrible casting for one of the meaningful, important characters in the storyline.	bad series interest write cast also bear write ridiculous cast liam cunningham great benedict wong absolutely fantastic jess hong also pretty good role however eiza gonz lez absolutely terrible actress constant scene poor ridiculously force act cry mop buck tooth hang lip gap open wait insect fly mouth poor shameful cast good cunningham wong terrible cast one meaningful important character storyline
2	"There are many things done right in this show - the casting, the story, the attention to the details, the following of the already developed concepts and ideas. Take, for instance, one of the main characters of the show: the power armor; it's designed to look and behave just as in the games, so it has a real feel of a heavy force and slow-but-lethal feel to it (also, seeing Kyle MacLachlan in it is a sheer treat) - and there's many similar concepts taken ""as they were"": robotics, vaults, suits, guns, medication etc.Speaking of the story, it is perhaps not the most engaging one overall, but at the same time it's only the first season, and it's also engaging enough.Speaking of actors and characters, I think everyone's great and right where they belong in this show - I wouldn't focus the attention on anyone in particular as I think the whole ensemble is what really gets it going. And a special thanks to the people who built (or animated) the power armour - if I were to dedicate the praise to one character, that'd be it.With all the greatness, there's a surprising number of goofs: endless rounds in a six-shooter guns, lack of lights on power armours (when even pip-boys have them), unclear difference between some vaults etc. It doesn't spoil the show, but it's odd given it's based on video games where all these aspects are at the core of the gameplay/storytelling.Overall, I've enjoyed the show - it's gory, cooky, bizzare, infantile, peculiar and vivid. It's great."	many thing do right show cast story attention detail follow already develop concept idea take instance one main character show power armor design look behave game real feel heavy force slow lethal feel also see kyle maclachlan sheer treat many similar concept take robotic vault suit gun medication etc speak story perhaps engage one overall time first season also engage enough speak actor character think everyone great right belong show focus attention anyone particular think whole ensemble really get go special thank people build animate power armour dedicate praise one character greatness surprise number goof endless round six shooter gun lack light power armour even pip boy unclear difference vault etc spoil show odd give base video game aspect core gameplay storytelle overall enjoy show gory cooky bizzare infantile peculiar vivid great
0	"Remember ""Another life"", the abysmal netflix show where a supposedly handpicked space expedition had its characters display the mental state, intelligence, tropes and team dynamics of a random group of college freshmen sharing a flat? Well, the netflix ""Three Body Problem"" will bring you the exact same experience, somewhat propped up by a much larger budget and sometimes using the source material. This time though, we have a bunch of characters with the dynamics of a generic soap opera who are supposedly world-leading physicists.Ultimately, even as a stand-alone source, the show is passable at best. Characters are extremely flat, dialogues feel from forced to outright cringeworthy in how much they mismatch the characters and their delivery. The ""streamlined"" story feels overloaded with irrelevant points at the expense of the main storyline, which seems to minimise the ""science"" in ""science fiction"" It's insulting the intelligence of audience with its avoidance of anything remotely beyond the most basic science. ""The Expanse"" showed you can make a great show and still introduce physics concepts to the viewers, who will love it. Whether by incompetence or indifference, the Netflix ""3BP"" seems to be unable to do it. The source material means it's still an Ok watch, but if you sleep through half an episode, you probably won't miss anything.As an adaptation the show is terrible. The plot has been butchered with the key message and theme completely missing, replaced with soap opera nonsense.The character swaps by themselves aren't good or bad. The should could have been a great opportunity to represent a female lead in a male-dominated field like physics, like ""Queen's Gambit"" was for chess. But the lazy fashion in which the swap was made, combined with poor acting means that this opportunity was missed."	remember another life abysmal netflix show supposedly handpicke space expedition character display mental state intelligence trope team dynamic random group college freshman share flat well netflix three body problem bring exact experience somewhat prop much large budget sometimes use source material time though bunch character dynamic generic soap opera supposedly world lead physicist ultimately even stand alone source show passable good character extremely flat dialogue feel force outright cringeworthy much mismatch character delivery streamline story feel overload irrelevant point expense main storyline seem minimise science science fiction insult intelligence audience avoidance anything remotely beyond basic science expanse show make great show still introduce physics concept viewer love whether incompetence indifference netflix bp seem unable source material mean still ok watch sleep half episode probably miss anything adaptation show terrible plot butcher key message theme completely miss replace soap opera nonsense character swap good bad could great opportunity represent female lead male dominate field like physic like queen gambit chess lazy fashion swap make combine poor act mean opportunity miss
1	Very good series but super annoyed that every series has to have some sort of lgbtq character, it's not even realistic to have a female trying to be a male character in a apocalyptic series , the show is supposed to portray fallout not modern times 👎 I hope that in the future tv can go back to being entertainment and not propaganda for the left or right party. Americans do not watch tv to gain political perspective and tv today is so centered on this it makes it super hard to get into a series that is good , such as this , good tv show but gotta deal with the bs modern times politics , seperate it from entertainment it's not that crazy!	good series super annoy every series sort lgbtq character even realistic female try male character apocalyptic series show suppose portray fallout modern time hope future tv go back entertainment propaganda leave right party americans watch tv gain political perspective tv today center make super hard get series good good tv show get ta deal bs modern time politic seperate entertainment crazy
0	"The remake of the 80s series ""Shogun"" presents a compelling portrayal of feudal Japan, yet falters in its casting decisions. While the storyline remains captivating, the actor portraying Blackthorne lacks the depth and authenticity of the original.My main issue with this series is cultural representation, notably in its depiction of Portuguese characters. Despite every other actor (Spanish, English or Japanese) speaking their native languages (a hurdle to keep up sometimes), the Portuguese speak English. A terrible portrait of what was the biggest empire of the time. Additionally, the cultural mismatch detracts from the overall immersion of the narrative."	remake series shogun present compel portrayal feudal japan yet falter cast decision storyline remain captivate actor portray blackthorne lack depth authenticity original main issue series cultural representation notably depiction portuguese character despite every actor spanish english japanese speak native language hurdle keep sometimes portuguese speak english terrible portrait big empire time additionally cultural mismatch detract overall immersion narrative
2	Wow, this is actually really good!I have to start my review by saying i never played the game so I entered with zero expectations, so im telling you when i binged this entire thing my mind was blown away. This is wonderfully done, shot, written and directed!First episode if you're like me unaware of the game wouldn't make a lot of sense, but when you go further you'll get attached to each character and the story itself. About the story, I've watched dozens of apocalyptic works and even games, not so much time ago the show Silo nearly had thhe same idea but surely different potentials. What I found interesting in Fallout is the philosophy about the apocalyptic world they're living in, how in an a capitalist society we well always end up like this, and the motivation behind each character to still live this awful life and their narratives is what singled out Fallout for me!	wow actually really good start review say never play game enter zero expectation I m tell binge entire thing mind blow away wonderfully do shoot write direct first episode like unaware game make lot sense go get attach character story story watch dozen apocalyptic work even game much time ago show silo nearly thhe idea surely different potential find interest fallout philosophy apocalyptic world live capitalist society well always end like motivation behind character still live awful life narrative single fallout
0	This remake of Clavells Shogun is inferior to the previous incarnation with Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune is every way. In the first Mini Series the writers followed the Novel exactly all the way through. In this version they deviated, beginning with Rodriguez going overboard, and then washing up on an Island, found and rescued by Kasigi Yabu after he washed up on the rocks.Then when Toranaga puts Blackthorne in prison, he meets Friar Domingo, who very briefly tells him of the black ship but not it's importance and the writers leave out all the detail and his learning Japanese is left out completely. The way he leave prion is totally different and his instruction of Toranaga into the partition of the world by the Pope in the Treaty of Zaragoza is glossed over so quickly that it's importance on the story is lost. Blackthorne's desire to pursue the Black ship is lost. In the book that is the thread that ties the entire plot line and all the characters together into a wonderful novel. The assassin from the Tong that comes in the night is after Toranaga in the current version whereas in the Novel and mini series he, now a she, was after Blackthorne.	remake clavell shogun inferior previous incarnation richard chamberlain toshiro mifune every way first mini series writer follow novel exactly way version deviate begin rodriguez go overboard wash island find rescue kasigi yabu wash rock toranaga put blackthorne prison meet friar domingo briefly tell black ship importance writer leave detail learn japanese leave completely way leave prion totally different instruction toranaga partition world pope treaty zaragoza glos quickly importance story lose blackthorne desire pursue black ship lose book thread tie entire plot line character together wonderful novel assassin tong come night toranaga current version whereas novel mini series blackthorne

Like a typical morality tale each episode may highlight a lesson in life but I can tell they can dig a little deeper with the through lines in the plot. A lighthearted show with a few dark spots here and there to deepen the connection with the characters.	lot humor lot heart one nathan fillion could carry show reveal different kind police people empathy like typical morality tale episode may highlight lesson life tell dig little deep line plot lighthearte show dark spot deepen connection character
2	"EPISODE 01 - ANJIN:""Shogun"" dives headfirst into feudal Japan in its premiere episode, ""Anjin."" Lush visuals and intricate costumes transport viewers to 1600, while the story unfolds through the eyes of both a powerful warlord and a shipwrecked English pilot.The episode masterfully establishes the complex power dynamics and cultural clashes at play. Lord Toranaga navigates political intrigue, while John Blackthorne, an outsider, struggles to adapt to Japanese customs.While the pacing might be slow for some, the deliberate approach allows for nuanced character development. The episode doesn't shy away from portraying the realities of the time, and a thought-provoking closing monologue challenges viewers' perspectives. ""Anjin"" sets the stage for an epic journey with its captivating story, stunning visuals, and intricate writing.9.05/10.EPISODE 2 - SERVANTS OF TWO MASTERSWhile not quite reaching the heights of the premiere, ""Shogun's"" second episode, ""Servants of Two Masters,"" continues to build the complex world and political intrigue of feudal Japan.The episode focuses heavily on exposition, laying out the motivations and alliances of various characters. While this can feel clunky at times, with characters delivering lengthy explanations, it ultimately provides a deeper understanding of the power struggles at play.One of the episode's highlights is the revelation of the Portuguese Jesuits' influence. Their control over trade and their willingness to manipulate for personal gain adds a layer of complexity to the political landscape.We also see the first signs of John Blackthorne becoming more than just a pawn. His knowledge about the Portuguese and their secret gun-running base proves valuable to Lord Toranaga.The episode isn't without its flaws. The pacing feels slow at times, and some of the dialogue comes across as overly explanatory. However, the episode is saved by strong performances, particularly from Tadanobu Asano, who steals the show as the cunning and conflicted Yabushige.Overall, ""Servants of Two Masters"" is a solid, albeit slightly uneven, episode that builds upon the foundation laid in the premiere. It leaves viewers eager to see how the various factions will clash and how Blackthorne will find his place in this intricate web of power and intrigue.8.975/10."	episode anjin shogun dive headfirst feudal japan premiere episode anjin lush visual intricate costume transport viewer story unfold eye powerful warlord shipwreck english pilot episode masterfully establish complex power dynamic cultural clash play lord toranaga navigate political intrigue john blackthorne outsider struggle adapt japanese custom pace might slow deliberate approach allow nuanced character development episode shy away portray reality time think provoke close monologue challenge viewer perspective anjin set stage epic journey captivate story stun visual intricate write episode servant two masterswhile quite reach height premiere shogun second episode servant two master continue build complex world political intrigue feudal japan episode focus heavily exposition lie motivation alliance various character feel clunky time character deliver lengthy explanation ultimately provide deep understand power struggle play one episode highlight revelation portuguese jesuit influence control trade willingness manipulate personal gain add layer complexity political landscape also see first sign john blackthorne become pawn knowledge portuguese secret gun run base prove valuable lord toranaga episode without flaw pace feel slow time dialogue come across overly explanatory however episode save strong performance particularly tadanobu asano steal show cunne conflict yabushige overall servant two master solid albeit slightly uneven episode build upon foundation lie premiere leave viewer eager see various faction clash blackthorne find place intricate web power intrigue

0	This rating is purely for the well acted but ultimately unsatisfactory and frankly unworthy Season 8 Episode 6 Finale of GoT. Not sure if it was D&D's intention to deviate away from or stick as closely as possible to GRRM's ending. Either way, for many - including myself - what had been a magnificent, game-changing series came to a rather sorry and mundane end. Rather like a magic carpet ride that ends in a nondescript industrial estate in the middle of nowhere. These beloved (and loathed) characters deserved a whole lot better.So, in order to cheer-up disappointed fans, HBO should forget about plans for prequels and spin-offs and announce immediate plans for a comedy remake of GOT with an entirely new cast.For starters, here are a few lead actor suggestions:Matt Berry as Jon Snow, Dawn French as Daenerys, Miranda Hart as Cersei, Kathy Burke as Tyrion. The dragons and direwolves, so excellent in the original version, would now have an opportunity to display their comic range.You can decide other casting choices amongst yourselves!	rat purely well act ultimately unsatisfactory frankly unworthy season episode finale get sure intention deviate away stick closely possible grrm end either way many include magnificent game change series come rather sorry mundane end rather like magic carpet ride end nondescript industrial estate middle nowhere beloved loathe character deserve whole lot well order cheer disappoint fan hbo forget plan prequel spin off announce immediate plan comedy remake get entirely new cast starter lead actor suggestion matt berry jon snow dawn french daenery miranda hart cersei kathy burke tyrion dragon direwolve excellent original version would opportunity display comic range decide cast choice amongst

1	"I've been a big fan since the start of the show. But have disappointed lately.To sum up Season 5 in one word, it would be disjointed. The season started off with a lot of promise, carrying over from a great finale in season 4. The Rosalind Dyer storyline was great and was expecting the serial killer angle to continue. The first 10-11 episodes of this season were well written, tight, and continuous.The second half of the season came across like a hastily written mess. What happened to Rosalind's ""assistant?"" Who shot her? I probably missed an episode of ""Rookie - Feds."" I was also expecting more about Chris, the jilted ADA (who I think will come back as a bad guy).Storylines from earlier in the season seemed to be forgotten or diminished. Even the ""Chenford"" angle fizzled. That was very surprising. The two most popular characters (at least on social media), just became part of the ensemble.It was nice to see the growth of Celina's character and finally have some resolution, but Aaron seems to have gotten lost in 2023. More comic relief than drama. Same with Angela and Wesley. Also, lots of peripheral characters (husbands, kids, etc.) just disappeared from the show in the past few months. Belt tightening?The finale was good, viewed as a standalone. But it should tie back to the season. Not seeing that. Glad to see Aaron get in on the drama again. I believe he will be back next season.In fairness, the show that does a lot pf location shooting, the weather in SoCal probably played a big part in the season's diminished episodes. Hopefully everyone was okay. Lots of studio shoots in the final episodes. The looming writers' strike did not help either. I am sympathetic to that and totally understand. But my expectation was too high.The writing team is awesome. So, I'm setting high expectations again. Hoping for a ""back to basics,"" great season 6. 😊"	big fan since start show disappoint lately sum season one word would disjoint season start lot promise carry great finale season rosalind dyer storyline great expect serial killer angle continue first episode season well write tight continuous second half season come across like hastily write mess happen rosalind assistant shoot probably miss episode rookie feds also expect chris jilt ada think come back bad guy storyline early season seem forget diminish even chenford angle fizzle surprise two popular character least social medium become part ensemble nice see growth celina character finally resolution aaron seem get lose comic relief drama angela wesley also lot peripheral character husband kid etc disappear show past month belt tighten finale good view standalone tie back season see glad see aaron get drama believe back next season fairness show lot pf location shoot weather socal probably play big part season diminish episode hopefully everyone okay lot studio shoot final episode loom writer strike help either sympathetic totally understand expectation high write team awesome set high expectation hop back basic great season

His acting in this is also some of his greatest I've seen him do but I cannot believe in 1960 a bunch of people in their late 30s are running around Europe spending their parents money... I also had a really hard time seeing Tom Ripley's love, infatuation or obsession with Dicky or Dicky's life. I think the writing is at fault here and not the acting because as I have mentioned above, Adam Scott can do no wrong. Overall I felt disengaged, disenchanted and disappointed. Such a shame.	look beautiful well shoot act good show disservice age actor please get wrong love adam scott wrong act also greatest see believe bunch people late run around europe spend parent money also really hard time see tom ripley love infatuation obsession dicky dicky life think write fault act mention adam scott wrong overall feel disengage disenchant disappoint shame
1	Is it bad? No. Far from it to be honest, but the little things I don't like it about it really get to me. The first and main thing I dislike is the character Maximus, he almost makes it unwatchable. He's a liar, a hypocrite, and somehow has the best luck, with essentially zero skill. I honestly hope they kill him off. Another thing I dislike is the cringy humor that happens every so often. Some of the humor is good, but other times it feels similar to Marvels attempt at jokes. I hope the humor gets darker the next season. Other than that, it's a great show, excellent set design, music is perfect, action is great.	bad far honest little thing like really get first main thing dislike character maximus almost make unwatchable liar hypocrite somehow good luck essentially zero skill honestly hope kill another thing dislike cringy humor happen every often humor good time feel similar marvel attempt joke hope humor get dark next season great show excellent set design music perfect action great
0	"I have not read the novels, so this review comes from watching the series with no foreknowledge or expectations beyond hoping for a good show.And, maybe 1.5 episodes in I realize that I'm just... bored. Things are happening, from a random suicide, some graphics about weird particle flights from an accelerator that are apparently wrong and a 'winking' night sky.... but nothing makes any sense and there's no sense of tension or character development. I decide to cut my losses because my instincts are telling me that this will be all form, no substance that is going to make me frustrated.I couldn't quite put my finger on what bothered me and thought that perhaps the novels just aren't for me.And then I saw that the Chinese version was available on Amazon. I watched just the first episode of the Chinese (Tencent) version and I was spellbound. The language is almost always Mandarin and the subtitles can come pretty quickly at first. But, I was completely drawn in. There may be some fancy special effects in later episodes but I will take plot and character and tension any day over ""Wow! Look what I can do with CGI and Chat GPT!""The Tencent version has tension and character development. The scientist suicides are presented and clearly communicated as an international crisis and it's compelling and feels like a completely different story.I was finally able to figure out what was so wrong with the Netflix adaptation. It violates the fundamental rule of writing: ""Show. Don't tell"". The Netflix version is constantly telling us what's happening and telling us that something must be important... but it doesn't show why. It doesn't convey the story as anything but some kind of paint-by-numbers multimillion dollar special effects extravaganza.If they had spent a fraction of the money and just dubbed the Tencent version it would be 100X better for 1,000X less money."	read novel review come watch series foreknowledge expectation beyond hop good show maybe episode realize bore thing happen random suicide graphic weird particle flight accelerator apparently wrong wink night sky nothing make sense sense tension character development decide cut loss instinct tell form substance go make frustrate quite put finger bother think perhaps novel see chinese version available amazon watch first episode chinese tencent version spellbind language almost always mandarin subtitle come pretty quickly first completely draw may fancy special effect later episode take plot character tension day wow look cgi chat gpt tencent version tension character development scientist suicide present clearly communicate international crisis compel feel like completely different story finally able figure wrong netflix adaptation violate fundamental rule write show tell netflix version constantly tell we happen tell we something must important show convey story anything kind paint number multimillion dollar special effect extravaganza spend fraction money dub tencent version would x well x less money
1	As a person who played every fallout game to completion, including Tactics, this series has done a great job. But there are some cringe moments.In the game, sex was there, but the act itself was an abstraction. It was a PC game with a content rating. In this series, Lucy just outing and asking anyone for sex was weird. Maximus not knowing what sex was, but describing an erection he once had as a pimple was bizarre. A group of female dwellers unzip their vault suits to the waist exposing themselves during a ceremony. I laughed because it was so stupid I couldn't believe they just threw that scene in there. Checking off adult rating boxes could actually derail the story if the writers are not careful.Some errors in mismatched sets. Entering a vault through a building then exiting back into an arid desert. The Goul entering a 2 story farm house and exiting back through a different looking building. Sloppy...Overall the story is good enough and I recommend to watch if you were a fan. If fallout is new to you, then you have to go with there are no Integrated circuit Chips, yet alien fusion tech just showed up in this analog universe. And it does make sense.	person play every fallout game completion include tactic series do great job cringe moment game sex act abstraction pc game content rat series lucy out ask anyone sex weird maximus know sex describe erection pimple bizarre group female dweller unzip vault suit waist expose ceremony laugh stupid believe throw scene check adult rat box could actually derail story writer careful error mismatch set enter vault build exit back arid desert goul enter story farm house exit back different look build sloppy overall story good enough recommend watch fan fallout new go integrate circuit chip yet alien fusion tech show analog universe make sense
0	Disappointing. This had the potential to be so good. The plot is very interesting but the unconvincing acting and poor editing make this unwatchable for me. I made it through three eps before I had to say no more. I understand that not every actor in a show is going to give an award winning performance, but this is really bad. I was literally cringing during some scenes.It truly baffles me how there are so many good reviews. I can't be the only person who sees how lacking in quality this show is. Because it's not just the acting. Some scenes are too long (like a panning shot that should have been half the screen time). A lot of scenes contain (unintentional) uncomfortable pauses between characters that could have been helped by a decent score, but nope. Not this show.I'll stick with the books on this one.	disappoint potential good plot interest unconvincing act poor edit make unwatchable make three eps say understand every actor show go give award win performance really bad literally cringe scene truly baffle many good review person see lack quality show act scene long like pan shoot half screen time lot scene contain unintentional uncomfortable pause character could help decent score nope show stick book one
1	To coin a colloquialism...it was all boot and no cowboy.Brilliant production values. Very good acting all around. The cinematography is frankly, mind blowing. Every scene was directed pretty much exactly right. So what's the problem?The story was basically stalled for half the series. The first half of the series was full of adventure, warfare, cunning and intrigue to set the stage. Ok..I'm totally in...let's have the payoff.Then no payoff....and more no payoff...and the series ends with still no payoff.Good job getting me to watch to the end but bloody hell, the last 3 or 4 episodes was one long, slow, cliffhanger. Not cool, man...not cool.Nothing happened. Yeah, some stuff happened but nothing to move the plot along. Nothing was settled. The last two episodes were especially disappointing but I could kind of see this coming. There was way too much to do and not enough time to do it.I prepared myself for this but it didn't help. It still sucked. It's not the waiting for next season thing that bugs me. It's the having needlessly wasted my time for 3 or 4 hours that bugs me.You can only spend so much time looking out the window at a beautiful tableau. That's what this felt like. It was a pretty picture, not a story.	coin colloquialism boot cowboy brilliant production value good act around cinematography frankly mind blow every scene direct pretty much exactly right problem story basically stall half series first half series full adventure warfare cunne intrigue set stage ok totally let payoff payoff payoff series end still payoff good job get watch end bloody hell last episode one long slow cliffhanger cool man cool nothing happen yeah stuff happen nothing move plot along nothing settle last two episode especially disappoint could kind see come way much enough time prepare help still suck wait next season thing bug needlessly waste time hour bug spend much time look window beautiful tableau feel like pretty picture story

2	I was surprised when someone told me this series received only mixed review. Hmmm, it's made me wonder what the hell people want from sci-fi these days. The show definitely has a brain and is definitely striving to have a heart; but it doesn't have to travel far to find its soul. Superficially concerned with First Contact it's more about the lifespan of humanity and whether we deserve to inhabit our beautiful world and as the first season closes in on its ending the question looms larger sending its tentacles to every aspect human life. The actors are committed and the production values fit the proceedings and I'm looking forward to the resolution of some plot questions which give the show its propulsion. Keep going folks. Most of us are with you all the way!	surprise someone tell series receive mix review hmmm make wonder hell people want sci fi day show definitely brain definitely strive heart travel far find soul superficially concern first contact lifespan humanity whether deserve inhabit beautiful world first season close end question loom large send tentacle every aspect human life actor commit production value fit proceed look forward resolution plot question give show propulsion keep go folk we way
0	Why westernize it? The good thing about the book is that it makes sense, it is contextually linked. We cannot identify with these characters, everything is too rushed, too cramped. The dialogues are BAD. Noone feels real. And can Netflix writers form two consecutive sentences without using the F word? Yes you are cool we get it, but it just sounds vulgar nothing else.Oxford five is a group of losers, these are not scientists at all.

0	There was a lot of attention for the release of this new series. After watching the first episode, I noticed that they stress the use of their Axon body worn cameras, and it's like watching a horrible version of Southland. The main Officer, John Nolan looks like Ed Helms from the Hangover movies.	lot attention release new series watch first episode notice stress use axon body wear camera like watch horrible version southland main officer john nolan look like ed helm hangover movie
2	It should be a perfect 10 out of 10 however as anyone who is a fan of the series will tell you after season 6 there was a pretty aggressive decline in writing quality. Season 8 was so bad that it literally destroyed any hope of rewatching the series at all, as all of it amounts to nothing now. Dan and Doug should never be allowed to write anything ever again for what they did to one of the greatest shows ever on television.	perfect however anyone fan series tell season pretty aggressive decline write quality season bad literally destroy hope rewatche series amount nothing dan doug never allow write anything ever one great show ever television

2	D&D proved to us that they can make a good adaptation if the source material is exists. The problem starts if it's not completed yet (looking at you, GOT season 6-9) Luckily, the 3 body problem from Cixin Liu is a complete trilogy, and I think so far it's good. The story is somewhat simplified, and moving less characters to keep the focus, but it's understandable. I do not like every change they made, but I still think that they made a good job.The characters are good, I liked Da Shi (the officer) the most, he is almost exactly how I imagined him.Maybe this will be a redemption arc for D&D. I'm rooting for them.Netflix, let the 2nd and 3rd part happen.	prove we make good adaptation source material exist problem start complete yet look get season luckily body problem cixin liu complete trilogy think far good story somewhat simplify move less character keep focus understandable like every change make still think make good job character good like da shi officer almost exactly imagine maybe redemption arc root netflix let nd rd part happen
0	I couldn't finish the first two episodes and quit. They created a world, but the world has literally our modern culture with some sci-fi/fantastic creatures. The characters are stupid, and the writing is so off. In the first episode, they don't want to touch or be around outsiders, and in the second episode, the main girl walks around and wants to shake strangers' hands. All characters are literally stupid, but they look like they tried creating funny/goody characters, but it's an epic fail. Time wasting. I wish I could get my time back. Whoever voted this series high is the reason for my wasted time.	finish first two episode quit create world world literally modern culture sci fi fantastic creature character stupid write first episode want touch around outsider second episode main girl walk around want shake stranger hand character literally stupid look like try create funny goody character epic fail time waste wish could get time back whoever vote series high reason waste time
0	I loved Nathan Fillion in Castle, as the Octopus in Resident Alien. I loved season 1 and even 2. I loved when he reconnected with his first love and thought it stupid when she dumped him to go back to her loser husband. It really went down hill when he dates & asks his firefighter girlfriend to marry him. Her character is too unbelievable. She tells paramedics who to do their job. She runs into Nolan while fighting fires all over the city. Not only that but when Nolan has to go to an Army base, who's there and kicking bad guys butts? Yep firefighter girlfriend. And Chen hooking up with her former TO! I miss Nolan's old multimillionaire bed friend. I stopped watching midway through season 3.	love nathan fillion castle octopus resident alien love season even love reconnecte first love think stupid dump go back loser husband really go hill date ask firefighter girlfriend marry character unbelievable tell paramedic job run nolan fight fire city nolan go army base kick bad guy butt yep firefighter girlfriend chen hook former miss nolan old multimillionaire bed friend stop watch midway season
0	As a Vietnam era veteran I could not wait to see this series. After viewing 1/2 hour of episode 1, I turned it off. Just terrible. The acting, the actors, it had nothing to do with war. I felt there should have been scenes that depicted a military camp or soldiers. It just didn't make sense to me. What was it about? Maybe I'm getting too old but I just couldn't follow the scenes or the actors. What they said made no sense to me. I expected a lot more from the individuals that put this together. The whole Vietnam era is very touchy with americans. I thought this would be made with A Touch of Class.Robert Downeys makeup was a joke. The other reviewers loved it. I will watch it one more time.

2	Overall the show looks good and sounds good. The tone is perfect with all characters being ridiculous. I grew up with FO1 and FO2 and the show is more in line with later games but it's fineIt's starts to fast introducing everyone in 1st episode and then continues with weird cuts to different characters.The characters and not particularly likable with except for Walton Goggins, he is great. Lucy is like a mormon that never seen and outside world - the problem is that it is rarely funny. Maximus on the other hand is not relatable, why does he do what he do - what people hurt him and what revenge he wants to tak. Perhaps it is a set up for later reveal but right now he is somehow bland - is he good, bad, opportunistic. He seems exactly like Star Wars black trooper who was there but is not remembered because he wasn't well written character or really relevant to the story.Some people complained that many game locations are absent or destroyed. I guess they are right, there is a missed opportunity for many references.Same with the Brotherhood / Enclave. Looks a bit like like both factions were merged into one, but perhaps, again, it is a set up for later seasons.One glaring aspect of the show is ultra violence. Its a trend lately (The Boys, Gen V, Invincible and probably more). The game was never so bloody (although there were occasional decapitations). It doesn't really add to the show that much.Fallout is a really well made adaptation, it capture many aspects of the game. Its just overall the show doesn't make you care about its characters. Character motivations are unconvincing. The Last of US show managed it better. But still I hope next Fallout season will be better.	overall show look good sound good tone perfect character ridiculous grow fo fo show line later game fineit start fast introduce everyone st episode continue weird cut different character character particularly likable except walton goggin great lucy like mormon never see outside world problem rarely funny maximus hand relatable people hurt revenge want tak perhaps set later reveal right somehow bland good bad opportunistic seem exactly like star war black trooper remember well write character really relevant story people complain many game location absent destroy guess right miss opportunity many reference brotherhood enclave look bite like like faction merge one perhaps set later season one glare aspect show ultra violence trend lately boy gen v invincible probably game never bloody although occasional decapitation really add show much fallout really well make adaptation capture many aspect game overall show make care character character motivation unconvincing last we show manage well still hope next fallout season well
1	I don't know why other people like mysteries or thrillers, but I like a lot of them because they have relatable characters. They aren't rich, living in worlds I have no interest in. I really despise the excesses we're supposed to admire. I hate it. I want to see worlds where real average people are represented. Not some millionaire ahole, no. The British know how to create human stories, because as many issues they have with class divisions they at least examine these issues in their shows. But not American creators. Nope. The directors and show runners that actually get funded for projects here really want to shove a certain kind of lifestyle down our collective throats. I just really miss seeing human stories set in the US, about average people. Preferring shows shot on location with little green screen. This is not worth my time, but some people will enjoy this. It's not for me. I didn't think the character development was the least bit interesting, nor was the shooting style or yge world any of them inhabit.	know people like mystery thriller like lot relatable character rich live world interest really despise excess suppose admire hate want see world real average people represent millionaire ahole british know create human story many issue class division least examine issue show american creator nope director show runner actually get fund project really want shove certain kind lifestyle collective throat really miss see human story set we average people prefer show shoot location little green screen worth time people enjoy think character development least bite interest shoot style yge world inhabit

GoT team seemed to have just gone on a massive bender throughout the whole of season 8. Squeezed it all in 6 episodes, probably cos they just wanted it over with. They got all their success and thought ""who cares dude, we're done"".

1	"Seasons 1-4, I cannot argue with. There was always something going on that kept me at the edge of my seat, and I thoroughly enjoyed that. However, as the show progressed, I couldn't help but grow tired of the repetition. It's more of a soap opera now, which, if that's what you enjoy, go for it. I grew less and less interested in the ""who's kissing who"" aspect and just wanted to know what happens next in the facility. Overall, it starts off strong, but it's definitely being stretched out far too long."	season argue always something go keep edge seat thoroughly enjoy however show progress help grow tire repetition soap opera enjoy go grow less less interest kiss aspect want know happen next facility overall start strong definitely stretch far long

2	"I finished watching ""Ripley"" on Netflix. Wow, what an excellent mini-series! It is a new take on Patricia Highsmith's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"". Filmed digitally in crisp black and white, the cinematography is fantastic and a wonderful choice for the period. As for the acting, it is good all round, but Andrew Scott as Tom Ripley is the highlight - I cannot say enough about his performance, he is likely to win an Emmy. Dakota Fanning is good as Marge. Johnny Flynn as Dickie is OK, but he certainly lacks the charisma and charm of Jude Law from the movie - there is zero chemistry between him and Ripley or Marge for that matter. I certainly enjoyed Maurizio Lombardi's performance as Inspector Pietro Ravini and the rest of the Italian cast. Watch for Sting's child Eliot Sumner as Freddie Miles (not as enamored of this casting choice, it made me miss Phillip Seymour Hoffman from the movie). But this series overall is a must watch for Scott's performance along with the great visuals! Very highly recommended. 9/10 (I deducted one point for the casting choices of Flynn and Sumner)."	finish watch ripley netflix wow excellent mini series new take patricia highsmith talente mr ripley film digitally crisp black white cinematography fantastic wonderful choice period act good round andrew scott tom ripley highlight say enough performance likely win emmy dakota fan good marge johnny flynn dickie ok certainly lack charisma charm jude law movie zero chemistry ripley marge matter certainly enjoy maurizio lombardi performance inspector pietro ravini rest italian cast watch ste child eliot sumner freddie miles enamor cast choice make miss phillip seymour hoffman movie series overall must watch scott performance along great visual highly recommend deduct one point cast choice flynn sumner

0	I have to clarify that the 1 atar given is only for Andrew Scott's acting which was the only surprisingly good thing in this series in addition to the fact that it was black and white.It is so painfully slow, every action, head turn, foot turn, him putting on shoes, him putting on coat for the 200th timo, every step pacing from one room to other, even Andrew breathing is shown. I am so surprised they did not show him wiping his a** in the toilet. You can easily skip episodes and not miss a thing. You feel like you are aging alongside the series.They have shown for 15mins, him taking body down the elevator...it is that painstakingly slow. Did they forget about something called editing and just decided to use whole footage?It could have made a good movie, the storyline is good although not something you haven't seen before....it is very predictable or very surprisingly stupid at times. But it ihas been annoyingly streched so long tht I am sure it has put a dent in time.People who have given it 9*, have a very different taste and way too much time at their hands.1* for good acting, lighting, location and clothing, 0 for direction, music, editing, and pretty much everything else.I wish i had not believed the rating. Watch at your own risk.	clarify atar give andrew scott act surprisingly good thing series addition fact black white painfully slow every action head turn foot turn put shoe put coat th timo every step pace one room even andrew breathe show surprise show wipe toilet easily skip episode miss thing feel like age alongside series show min take body elevator painstakingly slow forget something call edit decide use whole footage could make good movie storyline good although something see predictable surprisingly stupid time iha annoyingly streche long tht sure put dent time people give different taste way much time hand good act light location clothe direction music edit pretty much everything else wish believe rat watch risk
0	First episode has really turned me off from wanting to watch more.Why is this show done as if it's a horror movie? Weird fish-eye lense camera's, shake cam's, strange, dark atmosphere with horror movie music and characters doing lines like they're trying to be weird about it. Everythign is dark, rainy, misty, dreary as if it's all a vague, unnerving nightmare.This is supposed to be an adventure of discovery, of culture clashes, not this depressing nightmare.It's so...off, so weird.The old mini-series was fantastic. It had great and renowned actors, some of them movie legends like Chamberlain and Mifune. I'm sorry to say I know nobody who is in this show. All these plastic faces, perfectly sculputed by the best of cosmetic surgeons make these characters feel unreal and unnatural. They are too perfect, adding to it all an unauthentic feeling. They don't feel like regular people, they feel like beautiful, perfect actors.The direction is like a strange, ungodly mix of the worst overdramatized parts of both Western and Japanese movie-making. In the first episode, event after event just happens like ticking boxes on a list, it's so unnatural without any feeling of connection. That the scenes seemed to often be so short didn't help at all. Remember when lord Yabu gets introduced in the old mini-series? That's quite the scene. It's in no hurry. None of that in this new show, none of it, everything has to happen quickly and you never get to just sit and enjoy a long scene with good drama.The way the language barrier was represented in the old mini-series was very good, perhaps brought on by the fact that there was a genuine language barrier for the cast that made it all that more believable. They truly were a different class of actors.	first episode really turn want watch show do horror movie weird fish eye lense camera shake cam strange dark atmosphere horror movie music character line like try weird everythign dark rainy misty dreary vague unnerve nightmare suppose adventure discovery culture clash depress nightmare weird old mini series fantastic great renowned actor movie legend like chamberlain mifune sorry say know nobody show plastic face perfectly sculpute good cosmetic surgeon make character feel unreal unnatural perfect add unauthentic feel feel like regular people feel like beautiful perfect actor direction like strange ungodly mix worst overdramatize part western japanese movie make first episode event event happen like tick box list unnatural without feel connection scene seem often short help remember lord yabu get introduce old mini series quite scene hurry none new show none everything happen quickly never get sit enjoy long scene good drama way language barrier represent old mini series good perhaps bring fact genuine language barrier cast make believable truly different class actor
1	The first season was great, second still good, third began going off the rails. The 4th was filled with cringe worthy moments. The one great actor of the show Nathan is almost like an extra in some latter episodes. And what's with Jenna Dewan's character? Superhero firefighter military? Is she also an fbi cia interpol agent that we don't know? Extremely irritating. Also, who thought that the bounty hunter character was remotely funny or that the new character simone wasn't completely ridiculous... season 4 was really hard to watch. I haven't begun the 5th and I'm really not looking forward to it. If the show was cancelled now I couldn't agree more - in fact, if someone told me now that the cast and writers knew the show was already cancelled, I'd immediately say: oh, that's why nobody involved in the show is caring. Yep, that would about explain it. Shame. I love seeing Nathan and hope they get decent writers back into the game like in the 1st season.	first season great second still good third begin go rail th fill cringe worthy moment one great actor show nathan almost like extra latter episode jenna dewan character superhero firefighter military also fbi cia interpol agent know extremely irritate also think bounty hunter character remotely funny new character simone completely ridiculous season really hard watch begin th really look forward show cancel agree fact someone tell cast writer know show already cancel immediately say oh nobody involve show care yep would explain shame love see nathan hope get decent writer back game like st season
1	Well, it's over. This review is spoiler-free.I spent almost a decade with Game of Thrones. I have seen the first few seasons 5 or 6 times.If you are the type of viewer that enjoys the ride, and you don't really care where it is taking you, then Game of Thrones is a10/10.It has some of the best production quality, acting, and cinematography not just on the small screen, but in all of cinema.However, it does not stick the landing.Seasons 7 and 8 are very rushed and poorly written resulting in a whimpering finale that leaves dozens of plot holes unfilled while also leaving a dry, poor taste in your mouth.I'm not exaggerating. DOZENS of plots are simply forgotten. The most interesting things in the show mean nothing at all. The intrigue goes nowhere. You can ignore at least 75% of the interesting lore and characters, since they mean absolutely nothing.But, it LOOKS amazing, which is why it gets a 6.Also, if you are a student of acting, all of the actors and actresses are really spot-on, and the sound and music are unparalleled.Overall, Game of Thrones is a massive disappointment. It will go down as one of the most controversial and divisive series of all time. Its last two seasons are incomprehensibly rushed, and those seasons betray almost every theme and plot that the books spent decades refining.Even after all that, it is quite a journey getting there. If that's what interests you, then I cautiously recommend Game of Thrones with a warning that it has very little payoff.	well review spoiler free spend almost decade game throne see first season time type viewer enjoy ride really care take game throne good production quality act cinematography small screen cinema however stick land season rush poorly write result whimper finale leave dozen plot hole unfille also leave dry poor taste mouth exaggerate dozen plot simply forget interest thing show mean nothing intrigue go nowhere ignore least interest lore character since mean absolutely nothing look amaze get also student act actor actress really spot sound music unparalleled overall game throne massive disappointment go one controversial divisive series time last two season incomprehensibly rush season betray almost every theme plot book spend decade refine even quite journey get interest cautiously recommend game throne warn little payoff
0	Shogun way back, the first televised version, had far more elegance and detail than this version. Shogun 2024 is a darker, more mean-spirited version of the origanal book and TV series. It is also racing through the story, this version, omitting so much detail of the story of an English pilot findinh himself in an inter-clan Japanrse war. They have also changed the origiunal story line into a much more violent one than the original. The cast for the most part is outstanding, but not as exciting as the earlier TV version. They are duller, meaner, and darker. The absolute square man playing Anji-san is terrible in this part, the most impotant guy in the story. He is dull, excessively masculine and without an ounce of humor or grace. He is a blunt object, in this version, placed between warring ego-maniacs. Though lavishly produced, there is no grace to the photography or the staging. There are so many subt,le scenes in the original that are entirely missed here. Interesting certainly, but deeply flawed.	shogun way back first televise version far elegance detail version shogun darker mean spirit version origanal book tv series also race story version omit much detail story english pilot findinh inter clan japanrse war also change origiunal story line much violent one original cast part outstanding excite early tv version duller meaner darker absolute square man play anji san terrible part impotant guy story dull excessively masculine without ounce humor grace blunt object version place war ego maniacs though lavishly produce grace photography stag many subt le scene original entirely miss interest certainly deeply flaw
2	For the first 8 dozen seasons it was brilliant wish-fulfillment fantasy for nearly-braindead women. No other show could match the ingenious concept of having average to unattractive females hooking up with buff, gorgeous male doctors. Ka-ching!Then after the writhers finally got tired of beating that concept to death, with the smoothness of a popped-clutch they transitioned to preachy faux progressive hectoring in every episode. But that's fine, because the hook was already set deep into the maws of the landwhale audience.Really, even after 56 years on air, Gray's Anatomy is Hollowood at it's best.	first dozen season brilliant wish fulfillment fantasy nearly braindead woman show could match ingenious concept average unattractive female hook buff gorgeous male doctor ka ching writher finally get tire beat concept death smoothness pop clutch transition preachy faux progressive hector every episode fine hook already set deep maw landwhale audience really even year air gray anatomy hollowood well
0	Why is the only character I liked the one that is about to die? He seems like the only one that does not act like a child, but he can't because he has cancer. He does not have many speaking parts... maybe that is why I liked him.It also seemed like they were more worried about diversity of ethnicity than they were a coherent story. It was very choppy at times. Then there were other times where they were trying to be mysterious, but it turned out to just be annoyingly cryptic... I would watch a scene over and over again not able to figure out what was going on. Then 5 minutes later they would introduce a completely different factor and connect it to that cryptic scene and leave you more confused than ever. I wish they would have focused on older actors... it would have made this far more suspenseful... a good story is better than a bringing political correctness into a film. The detective has a kid and they had to make a point to tell the audience that the kid was gay... how did that move the story along? It did not... no one cares about how characters prefer their sexual proclivities, especially when it is a character that does not even have a story line. It's like they just needed to check the box... gay character, check. If sexual preferences are not needed to further a story line, then please don't bring them up to check a box. It's not that being gay is bad in a movie, it's just annoying that they spend all this time checking boxes when they need to be explaining the cryptic PLOT AND STORY! This is what is so frustrating about art nowadays... it can't bring you into the art without trying to pound specific views or narratives in your head... like we need lessons from Hollywood of all places.Anyway, there is not much that made sense here. Had SO MUCH potential if they would have just stuck to the source material and followed it. Instead, they wanted to check boxes. We should have an inclusive art industry no doubt, but it shouldn't be done like this. This is insulting to the author, the viewer, the fans of the books, and even the actors... because some of them are getting ripped apart for being miscast. Why does it hurt to stay with the source material and what works. Not every show has to have a gay person in it. Not every show has to have a white, black, Hispanic, or Asian person in it. Not every show needs to have a woman or man in it. We have SO MANY GREAT STORIES in this world to make, stories of brave, kind, funny people from every back ground... so why take those stories away from them and force them into stories they don't fit into (based on the source material, not superficial things).The Aliens make no sense. They lied themselves. Now they hate liars? They allowed people to call them Lord. They knew they were not a Lord. The original one said they were a pacifist and that the rest of them were violent, yet the ones speaking to the cult leader said they are ALL ONE and know what each other are thinking, so they cannot lie. So how is this pacifist Alien separate from the rest of them if they are all ONE?The writers and directors should have focused on STORY instead of checking boxes and they would have caught all this stuff.My favorite characters in the show was Marlo Kellys. She acted like a psychopath very well and I really wanted her to be successful in her endeavors. The way she uses her eyes reminds me a lot of Aubrey Plaza, who is an amazing actress. I think we will be seeing a lot more of Marlo Kelly in the future.	character like one die seem like one act like child cancer many speak part maybe like also seem like worry diversity ethnicity coherent story choppy time time try mysterious turn annoyingly cryptic would watch scene able figure go minute later would introduce completely different factor connect cryptic scene leave confuse ever wish would focus old actor would make far suspenseful good story well bring political correctness film detective kid make point tell audience kid gay move story along one care character prefer sexual proclivity especially character even story line like need check box gay character check sexual preference need story line please bring check box gay bad movie annoy spend time check box need explain cryptic plot story frustrate art nowadays bring art without try pound specific view narrative head like need lesson hollywood place anyway much make sense much potential would stick source material follow instead want check box inclusive art industry doubt do like insult author viewer fan book even actor get rip apart miscast hurt stay source material work every show gay person every show white black hispanic asian person every show need woman man many great story world make story brave kind funny people every back grind take story away force story fit base source material superficial thing alien make sense lie hate liar allow people call lord know lord original one say pacifist rest violent yet one speak cult leader say one know think lie pacifist alien separate rest one writer director focus story instead check box would catch stuff favorite character show marlo kellys act like psychopath well really want successful endeavor way use eye remind lot aubrey plaza amaze actress think see lot marlo kelly future
0	The beginning was great - that's until the writers decided to kill of every character. I started watching a few years ago and it soon became my favourite show. I'd spent countless nights binging shows while waiting for the next season, and now the show is a complete MESS. I'm upset with how all the characters either got killed off or moved away, especially the latest with Alex running and starting a family with Izzie. Like are you kidding me? The show spent 15 YEARS developing his character with last three developing his love story with Jo. They were soul mates and now after helping her with treatment and worked hard to get her to know that he loves her, he RUNS.WORST SHOW EVER AND ITS A WASTE OF TIME. YOUR FAVOURITE CHARACTERS WILL MOST LIKELY GET KILLED OFF OR TOSSED. It's also become stupid like characters sleeping with almost the whole hospital. Every character is linked through people they've slept with. I'm done watching and I'm disappointed greatly. I would love to go back in time so I wouldn't have even given a thought to watch this stupid show in the first place.Characters die or get tossed, they all sleep together, and make stupid decisions that doesn't match themselves. If you're into medical dramas that are on the more realistic side of things, this show isn't the one for you.	begin great writer decide kill every character start watch year ago soon become favourite show spend countless night binge show wait next season show complete mess upset character either get kill move away especially late alex run start family izzie like kid show spend year develop character last three develop love story jo soul mat help treatment work hard get know love run bad show ever waste time favourite character likely get kill toss also become stupid like character sleep almost whole hospital every character link people sleep do watch disappoint greatly would love go back time even give think watch stupid show first place character die get toss sleep together make stupid decision match medical drama realistic side thing show one
1	I have to say I don't usually like police shows, especially ones that have a new weekly case that get solved in the episode. However this has such fun and interesting characters with development arcs that run through the series that keeps you interested. Also the cases usually have an integral part in the arcs.Nathan Fillion is as always brilliant and the rest of the cast really fill this out.I find myself laughing out loud every episode, usually at Fillion's bad luck.I hope this gets a following and doesn't get dropped as it is quite different to anything about at the minute.	say usually like police show especially one new weekly case get solve episode however fun interest character development arc run series keep interest also case usually integral part arc nathan fillion always brilliant rest cast really fill find laugh loud every episode usually fillion bad luck hope get follow get drop quite different anything minute

Not gonna lie the first three episodes were very promising, the characters were very talented and well suited for their roles.

1	"What I like most is the cast, the acting, and the production. Especially the Japanese actors shine in their roles (I had some difficulties with the characterization of the ""new"" Blackthorne). The story is, of course, well-known - if you have read the original book by James Clavell or watched the first adaptation for TV starring Richard Chamberlain. Additionally, if you know ""The Last Samurai"" with Tom Cruise, you will recognize many similarities. Regardless, Shogun is legitimate and a solid, well-made piece, good enough to kill some spare time. Conclusion: a good show, but it's definitely not the masterpiece that many other reviewers claim it to be. At least, that's my opinion."	like cast act production especially japanese actor shine role difficulty characterization new blackthorne story course well know read original book jam clavell watch first adaptation tv star richard chamberlain additionally know last samurai tom cruise recognize many similarity regardless shogun legitimate solid well make piece good enough kill spare time conclusion good show definitely masterpiece many reviewer claim least opinion
1	"To make it short: The Rookie is an entertaining crime/police show and it keeps you watching, even if it leaves mixed feelings...On one hand, the producers are trying to show realistic police work, including authentic lingo and procedures/rituals, on the other hand, this is exaggerated by inexperienced cops having more shootings and high-profile operations in their first year than most real cops in their lifetime. At least, I hope a real LAPD department doesn't run like that, even for senior officers like Tim Bradford.Once you get over that, it is an entertaining mixture of action, drama, personal issues of the main characters involved and some comedic elements, held together by a motivated and diverse cast you can mostly root for. The Rookie puts you somewhere between action popcorn cinema and Friends, you just have to put your expectations right.The main weak point is the script, with cases way above the paygrade of patrol officers, things often happening too fast too easy and kafka-esque moments that would keep a show like Prison Break running for a season (or at least several episodes) usually resolve in 40 minutes of an episode. Some characters are written out of the series in the worst kind of way after their actors left the show and the tone changes in seasons 2-3 where the storyline revolves a bit too much around racism, police brutality and community policing to organically integrate into the plot. Research tells this was demanded by the actor of Officer West who is of color and wanted the storyline to reflect more on this matter, which is fine, it is as legit as making this a good-clean-fun police advert, if it is done right - but it sometimes just feels as if the story elements are there to make a statement, the social media human rights activist is just too much of a cliché, dealing with 5 jobs and your daily yoga sessions, etc...However, the biggest problem is that The Rookie loses the (relative) realism of the first season. There is an element of vulnerability in the season #1 that vanishes as the rookies move up the ranks. The chance of making career-ending mistakes adds to the drama but as soon as everybody passes their exam, they become pretty much unbeatable superheroes, casually surviving gunfights, even off-duty against several enemies. Nolan's first gun incident causes a major investigation, suggesting he was at fault, later on he shoots people in the dozen and no questions are asked at all. Taking away the ""beginner"" element also takes away a lot tension that can't be compensated, even by the sheer amount of over-the-top storyline. At some point, every character was involved in a major conspiracy, blackmailing or other type of major crime. Just out of their freshmen year, they can become whatever they want, undercover agents, training officers... even established cops in their ranks for years start to change positions and move up the career ladder after Nolan, Chen and West hit the scene.Another thing is how character build-up works, here... The mainstream characters are well-introduced and built up, but on the other end, just dumped by the of a season, I mean West is one of the main character for 3 seasons, then gets killed without further explanation and there's not even a funeral scene. Perhaps there was some personal struggle on set but I still feel there is too much lazy writing.Now this review sounds largely negative but the rest is actually enjoyable, character interaction is good and there is definitely chemistry between some couples on-screen and I like the comedy element. Production value and visual esthetics are top-notch, too.I'll keep watching but I wish the authors would aim for a little less than everything for the upcoming seasons and give The Rookie a more human tone, again."	make short rookie entertain crime police show keep watch even leave mix feel one hand producer try show realistic police work include authentic lingo procedure ritual hand exaggerate inexperienced cop shoot high profile operation first year real cop lifetime least hope real lapd department run like even senior officer like tim bradford get entertain mixture action drama personal issue main character involve comedic element hold together motivate diverse cast mostly root rookie put somewhere action popcorn cinema friend put expectation right main weak point script case way paygrade patrol officer thing often happen fast easy kafka esque moment would keep show like prison break run season least several episode usually resolve minute episode character write series bad kind way actor leave show tone change season storyline revolve bite much around racism police brutality community police organically integrate plot research tell demand actor officer west color want storyline reflect matter fine legit make good clean fun police advert do right sometimes feel story element make statement social medium human right activist much clich deal job daily yoga session etc however big problem rookie lose relative realism first season element vulnerability season vanish rookie move rank chance make career end mistake add drama soon everybody pass exam become pretty much unbeatable superhero casually survive gunfight even duty several enemy nolan first gun incident cause major investigation suggest fault later shoot people dozen question ask take away beginner element also take away lot tension compensate even sheer amount top storyline point every character involve major conspiracy blackmail type major crime freshman year become whatever want undercover agent train officer even establish cop rank year start change position move career ladder nolan chen west hit scene another thing character build work mainstream character well introduce build end dump season mean west one main character season get kill without explanation even funeral scene perhaps personal struggle set still feel much lazy write review sound largely negative rest actually enjoyable character interaction good definitely chemistry couple screen like comedy element production value visual esthetic top notch keep watch wish author would aim little less everything upcoming season give rookie human tone
2	I love the plot and story line of this series. I feel like there are so many possibles with story lines about life beyond Earth, and sadly there is just not enough of them.That's why I am loving the plot of this series. However, I feel like we were just getting into the story and now we have to wait over a year for a second season, if that even happens?It feels like half a season to set up the next season, which just shouldn't cut it. A season should be good enough stand alone, without relying on future seasons.I don't see why Netflix always seems to cap seasons at 8 episodes... insanely short.	love plot story line series feel like many possible story line life beyond earth sadly enough love plot series however feel like get story wait year second season even happen feel like half season set next season cut season good enough stand alone without rely future season see netflix always seem cap season episode insanely short
2	I wasn't sure about casting Colin Farrell as an old style Phillip Marlow detective before watching this series but have been pleasantly surprised. He is following in some big shoes though really makes this his own. The self referencing clips from old black and white film noir are excellent and reinforce the style of this series. This script isn't as predictable as many are and has a pleasing amount of twists to keep you watching week to week. Pacing myself has never been a strong point and I'm glad I've been made to wait otherwise I would have binged all episodes by now.I hope this gets more series as the chemistry is good and I know by the end I'll be left wanting more. No.	sure cast colin farrell old style phillip marlow detective watch series pleasantly surprise follow big shoe though really make self reference clip old black white film noir excellent reinforce style series script predictable many please amount twist keep watch week week pace never strong point glad make wait otherwise would binge episode hope get series chemistry good know end leave want
0	The potential of the Fallout property is huge and this series is marred with poor writing, visual fx, timing, and acting.I've been a fan of the games for a long time and had immediate mixed feelings upon discovering a series was in the works. On the one hand, I was excited to be pulled back into the post-apocalyptic, war torn wasteland and reintroduced to my favourite characters and creatures. However, I immediately understood this could be another cash grab series, designed to meet the bare minimum for fans and simultaneously draw in a larger audience of new admirers. After watching the first season, the latter has been confirmed.There's are many times the dialogue is uninteresting and poorly timed, only exasperated by the lacklustre acting. The fight scenes are rubbish and remind me of a 1950s budget movie where the punches are feet away from the target. Moreover, the vfx and staging are so uninspired, it feels you're watching actors on a set.It does not feel like a show set in the Fallout universe.I would much rather no series at all than this poor excuse of a Fallout show.	potential fallout property huge series mar poor write visual fx time act fan game long time immediate mix feel upon discover series work one hand excite pull back post apocalyptic war tear wasteland reintroduce favourite character creature however immediately understand could another cash grab series design meet bare minimum fan simultaneously draw large audience new admirer watch first season latter confirm many time dialogue uninteresting poorly time exasperate lacklustre act fight scene rubbish remind budget movie punch foot away target moreover vfx stag uninspired feel watch actor set feel like show set fallout universe would much rather series poor excuse fallout show

1	It started great. Nice stories. Funny. Exciting. Good show to watch to pass some time. Interesting characters I actually like and / or are interested in.A just about middle age guy (perhaps a bit better looking than most, but that's just Hollywood) goes through some trouble and thinks he should shake up his live. Goes to the police academy and becomes a cop. The show starts there. He does cop stuff, wins some loses some.Then ... it seems they hired a few horrible writers that nixed anything positive in the show other than the acting. It starts to be not about entertainment, it's all about sending a message in season three. Never mind stories, never mind the narrative or the characters. I just stopped halfway through an episode and never bothered to watch another episode.	start great nice story funny excite good show watch pass time interest character actually like interest middle age guy perhaps bite well look hollywood go trouble think shake live go police academy become cop show start cop stuff win lose seem hire horrible writer nix anything positive show act start entertainment send message season three never mind story never mind narrative character stop halfway episode never bother watch another episode
1	"Well I only wrote once something about something here (2012 - stupid movie) so this is my second ""personal opinion and review"" .. After marathon watching this TV show 7 seasons in 15 days I had to write and share something.. I wanted to do it from season one but, too lazy..for so long I did not want to watch this, but finally I took a shot.. All in all show is not bad at all.. There are some really interesting characters, great situations, good acting.. BUT.. Reason why I had to write this is review is ""Main character"" and the TV shows name GREYS anatomy..This show could be SOOO MUCH better without this ugly, repulsive, annoying, irritating creature - Ellen Pompeo.. My god !! What where producers thinking ?!?!?! I am saying again - 7 SEASONS I am trying so hard to like her, trying to find at least ONE good thing about her and her appearance/acting but useless.. I don't understand..I really don't, so if someone can explain to me why this ""actor"" is irritating people for 7 seasons please answer me.. So many good actors in the show which I really enjoy to watch and this idiot has to ruin it all whit her- trying to act, ugly face and terrible voice... ufffffI can bet that 95% of people (women) here would be SO much better in this role than she is !! I don't know what else to say and not to repeat myself, how much she is terrible and that I hope that I will NEVER again have to see this retard on any TV screen again..I apologize to everyone here if I am ""over the line"" but I had to say (at least one more time) what retard she is and she is a ""lead role"" in show...

2	Cinematography is gorgeous. Costumes are great. Main character is an English pilot of a Dutch Merchant ship, who arrives in Japan in 1600. I really appreciate an American production being set in Japan, having a Japanese cast that acts out their lines in Japanese. As far as representation goes, I think this is the only right choice.However, they decided not to do the same with the other languages. When people are speaking in Portuguese, Spanish and even Dutch, the actors speak English. And as an American production, you do not want to have a series that is ALL subtitles. The series is made by and for an English speaking (and maybe Japanese) audience after all. I see a lot of people being salty about the amount of reading they have to do, or the lack of Portuguese being spoken. In my opinion, making a bilingual English/Japanese show is the best choice, ensuring the least amount of subtitles. They are able to reach a wide audience, ensure quality of performances in these two languages, and be respectful of the country it is set in. Would have been fun if it were a Portuguese production for accuracy, but is not.So, TL;DR. Looks and sounds great! Hope they keep up the quality. If reading buggs you, this show is not for you.	cinematography gorgeous costume great main character english pilot dutch merchant ship arrive japan really appreciate american production set japan japanese cast act line japanese far representation go think right choice however decide language people speak portuguese spanish even dutch actor speak english american production want series subtitle series make english speak maybe japanese audience see lot people salty amount read lack portuguese speak opinion make bilingual english japanese show good choice ensure least amount subtitle able reach wide audience ensure quality performance two language respectful country set would fun portuguese production accuracy tl dr look sound great hope keep quality read buggs show

I appreciated it as a stand-alone show independent of the earlier film, though it was a bit hard not to draw comparisons.Scott was too old for a credible swap to be viable. He was also a very untalented criminal to be able to pull off what he did. Fanning did a good job but what on earth were they thinking with Freddy? What a flat, dull character, devoid of personality.I didn't mind the black and white but combined with the artsy camera angles, long stares, dark shadows and mysterious animals, it landed on me like someone is angling to be labelled ""the new Hitchcock"". Worth watching but didn't blow me away."	try hard appreciate stand alone show independent early film though bite hard draw comparison scott old credible swap viable also untalente criminal able pull fan good job earth think freddy flat dull character devoid personality mind black white combine artsy camera angle long star dark shadow mysterious animal land like someone angle label new hitchcock worth watch blow away

2	"Let me start by saying I love game of thrones, absolutely love the characters and world that it presents. The acting is INCREDIBLE, the cinematography is UNBELIEVABLE, and the writing (up until season 8) was FANTASTIC. However, this show is basically broken up into two different shows: game of thrones seasons 1-6, and game of thrones seasons 7-8.Seasons 1-6 were breathtaking and addictive. I never watched the episodes live, I would wait a few weeks and binge watch them on HBOgo. This was the best way to watch in my opinion because the show was son addictive that I would spend 5+ straight hours just laying in bed watching it. This show could do no wrong in these seasons, it was 100% the greatest show of all time.But then comes seasons 7 and 8. Don't get me wrong season 7 was still good, but it was easy to see that the writing was getting sloppier and it was slipping. The show spent less time on dialogue and story, and more on action and fast pace. Season 7 also set up the disaster that was season 8. What the hell happened in season 8? I won't spoil anything but let's just say that characters don't act like themselves, they make stupid decisions and act like they did in season 1. None of them grew to end in a spot that they deserved to be in. There's also too much time spent on nothing, literally in this season you will watch characters getting dressed, staring into space, sitting there with a blank face, or weird montages of characters walking. Seriously this show is about deceit, dialogue, and the ""game"" that is game of thrones. But nope they abandon it all in this last season just to rush the ending and try to shock you.Overall this show is fantastic if you ignore seasons 7 and 8. Even with them it's still a good show, but I can never rewatch it knowing that it leads to the conclusions it did"	let start say love game throne absolutely love character world present act incredible cinematography unbelievable write season fantastic however show basically break two different show game throne season game throne season season breathtaking addictive never watch episode live would wait week binge watch hbogo good way watch opinion show son addictive would spend straight hour lie bed watch show could wrong season great show time come season get wrong season still good easy see write get sloppy slip show spend less time dialogue story action fast pace season also set disaster season hell happen season spoil anything let say character act like make stupid decision act like season none grow end spot deserve also much time spend nothing literally season watch character get dress star space sit blank face weird montage character walk seriously show deceit dialogue game game throne nope abandon last season rush end try shock overall show fantastic ignore season even still good show never rewatch know lead conclusion

1	Visually and comedically spot on.This series hits every note that identifies it as a Fallout story. The characters are quirky and colourful, the landscape equally so.There are plenty of Easter eggs to keep die hard fans happy.HoweverThis series feels like it had several directors, writers and creators fighting over it, the result therefore makes for a somewhat jarring viewing experience.A lot of the comedy misses the mark and falls flat with characters saying some very odd things at odd times.Most of the scenes in Vault 4 make no sense at all.It's definitely one of the better video game to screen adaptations however could have been a lot neater around the edges.	visually comedically spot series hit every note identify fallout story character quirky colourful landscape equally plenty easter egg keep die hard fan happy howeverthis series feel like several director writer creator fight result therefore make somewhat jar view experience lot comedy miss mark fall flat character say odd thing odd time scene vault make sense definitely one well video game screen adaptation however could lot neater around edge
0	So on Episode 5 the big reveal happens, the big plot twist is shown, and the best candidate for would-be villain gets killed. After that, the show devolves into a soap opera that only cares about the fee-fees of the characters.One of the characters is secretly in love but nobody cares because he's dying. Another character has hang-ups about decisions that kill other human beings but nobody cares because it's a war and that's just what happens. One character who is an actual nobody gets an offered unprecedently high position in the military out of nowhere and, again, nobody cares because nobody in the audience believes it makes any sense.Benioff & Weiss continue the Hollywood trend of failing upwards, after ruining game of thrones they come to ruin another series of books. Their touch shows in the blood bath that happens mid-season and tries to be Game of Thrones 2.0. And Just like in GoT, they failed miserably here.By the way, I'm writing this while episode 8 is playing in the background because I'm so bored of this show.	episode big reveal happen big plot twist show good candidate would villain get kill show devolve soap opera care fee fee character one character secretly love nobody care die another character hang up decision kill human be nobody care war happen one character actual nobody get offer unprecedently high position military nowhere nobody care nobody audience believe make sense benioff weiss continue hollywood trend fail upwards ruin game throne come ruin another series book touch show blood bath happen mid season try game throne like get fail miserably way write episode play background bore show
1	I was afraid this would happen - the series tries to be more accessible and interesting even for the average, 'dumb' audience. However, it doesn't work. The source material isn't Game of Thrones with twists and epic moments at the end of each chapter. So inevitably, it comes out flat and uninteresting because what the book excels at - its scientific side and detail for realism - is missing here. The viewer doesn't have time to properly like any character, so even if they all died, nobody would shed a tear for them. Music below average. What's especially bad is that despite Netflix's huge budget for the series, some scenes look cheap.	afraid would happen series try accessible interest even average dumb audience however work source material game throne twist epic moment end chapter inevitably come flat uninteresting book excel scientific side detail realism miss view time properly like character even die nobody would shed tear music average especially bad despite netflix huge budget series scene look cheap
1	The classic idea that aliens are invading the earth is put to the test in the modern era of physics series. The concentration on physic theory is mediocre but the collision with anti-physic movement in 1960s is well played. How does this lead to a alien invasion? Well, it turns out to be a rebellion against humanity by a victimized physisist of the anti-physic movements. The communication with a alien intelligence occurs and once they learn of our co-existence, they create a push to invade. It's that simple but there is a catch to the equation. The Aleins will take 400 years of space travel to reach Earth. Once it's conceived by human society, the series just feels dumber. 400 years later...etc.	classic idea alien invade earth put test modern era physics series concentration physic theory mediocre collision anti physic movement well play lead alien invasion well turn rebellion humanity victimize physisist anti physic movement communication alien intelligence occur learn co existence create push invade simple catch equation alein take year space travel reach earth conceive human society series feel dumber year later etc

That said, I've nothing to compare this 2024 production to.I found the series seldom entertaining, but when it was, it hit the mark. Parts of ""Ripley"" were painfully long, boring and I struggled to keep from fast forwarding past those scenes or completely cease watching the series altogether.Mr Scott's Irish accent occasionally slips through, obliterating any idea that Tom Ripley is an American. I suppose one could imagine Ripley being raised as a second generation American born to Irish immigrants, but that bridge is a bit too far for me.The idea that modern filming in black and white can add an air of nostalgia has come and gone.

Some episodes are simple stupid.2) All men in this show are either dumb or macho. All women are tough, smart, strong, wise and know everything - in each and every episode. Also men are constantly apologizing: ""Yes, Ma'am. I'm so sorry Ma'am."", ""You are right of course. Thank you Ma'am. I wasn't listening."". ""I want to apologize Ma'am."", and so on. The tough women fight convicts twice their size, have all the answers to all problems in the universe, and help men beeing less dumb - and of course help them apologize.This is a police show made by women, for women, where men act like in a woman's fairy tale - women lecture men in regards to romance, life, work, and generally everything else - like the former soldier female Chief - while wearing red high heels...Too much unrealistic emancipation in this show for me.Thank you Ma'am."	rookie entertain fast pace could great police show two thing spoil success many mistake regard police procedure really shame could easily fix episode simple stupid man show either dumb macho woman tough smart strong wise know everything every episode also man constantly apologize yes sorry right course thank listen want apologize tough woman fight convict twice size answer problem universe help man beee less dumb course help apologize police show make woman woman man act like woman fairy tale woman lecture man regard romance life work generally everything else like former soldier female chief wear red high heel much unrealistic emancipation show thank
0	I prefer cinema over novels, but hearing about the budget of this show, and seeing the results, I can only assume that most of the budget went into getting certain actors on board. John Bradley's performance was cheesy af, any parts with cgi were cheap looking. The show felt low budget, but it's still worth a watch. Especially if you enjoy this genre, regardless of the films misgivings, I enjoy the questions and thoughts such a show brings to my mind. I have a sneaky feeling I'd love the books. Some casting seemed perfect, others felt forced, special effects department definitely didn't get any access to the shows huge budget. I watched it to the end, if we get a season 2, I hope they hand it over to someone else to take care of.	prefer cinema novel hear budget show see result assume budget go get certain actor board john bradley performance cheesy af part cgi cheap look show feel low budget still worth watch especially enjoy genre regardless film misgive enjoy question thought show bring mind sneaky feel love book cast seem perfect other feel force special effect department definitely get access show huge budget watch end get season hope hand someone else take care
1	First two seasons had well written characters. Casting decisions seems to a solid positive and The interactions between characters were fun to watch. Show knew when to be funny and when to be serious moment and had me binge watch the first 2 seasons in a couple of days. Nathan fillion is amazing and has his usual charm.I recommend people to watch the first 2 seasons as these are actually good.Unfortunately from season 3 on wards show starts its decline. I don't really understand why every show from Hollywood now a days has to show the people of color as some sort of victims. As each episode progresses the show becomes less about cop show and more about pushing political messages.I was hoping this show wouldn't start virtue signalling. But after watching season 3 i was clearly wrong. And after reading some of ratings for season 4 , i realised that I should have stopped watching after season 2.	first two season well write character cast decision seem solid positive interaction character fun watch show know funny serious moment binge watch first season couple day nathan fillion amaze usual charm recommend people watch first season actually good unfortunately season ward show start decline really understand every show hollywood day show people color sort victim episode progress show become less cop show push political message hop show start virtue signal watch season clearly wrong read rat season realise stop watch season
1	Why did the first Matrix movie become a phenomenon? Well, for all the storytelling and character buildup reasons that this thing lacks. An actor doesn't have much to go with if the dialogue is speedily written with the help of AI with no attempt to allow a personality to shimmer through the text. Lots of misplaced cursing and joyless wording of stale lines dominate almost every interaction. How did movies like Matrix pull off the girl boss or the wise captain etc. With a mixed cast way before its time? I bet they could have written this one well, had they allowed more imagination and personality when creating these characters. Cursing and smoking doesn't make one look tough. Rather a boring cliché comes to mind.	first matrix movie become phenomenon well storytelle character buildup reason thing lack actor much go dialogue speedily write help ai attempt allow personality shimmer text lot misplace curse joyless word stale line dominate almost every interaction movie like matrix pull girl boss wise captain etc mix cast way time bet could write one well allow imagination personality create character curse smoke make one look tough rather bore clich come mind

Knight) who should've been the main character, and Christina (Sandra Oh), an acerbic and ambitious person - and of their struggle through life as a doctor.Um... no.It's a soap opera, and a very badly written one at that; I like some characters (Alex, George, Addison, Christina, Mark) and keep watching to see what happens to them, but the show is really over-the-top, repetitive and laughable (Code Black - the Superbowl episode - was mind-numbingly bad, as an example), and worse, in a lot of moments sounds like a teenage fanbrat's bad!fic (hold a radio over my head outside your window kind of love?

2	Up until season 17 grey's anatomy was 🔛🔝 it is such a good show and I recommend it, if you love medical/romantic shows, grey's anatomy is for you. I really enjoyed grey's cuz it's mixed with the study of medicine and romance it shows us Meredith and how her life is like and why she became a surgeon it also showed support for the LGBTQ+ by having a lesbian couple (Arizona and Callie) and there are ALOT of tragedies like the plane crash the shooting episode etc, this is literally a COMFORT show, and it also shows us how people can change I honestly changed after I finished watching grey's anatomy, tho I stopped watching it after season 17 because all of my favorite characters either left or died, but overall it's such a great show and I really recommend it.	season grey anatomy good show recommend love medical romantic show grey anatomy really enjoy grey cuz mix study medicine romance show we meredith life like become surgeon also show support lgbtq lesbian couple arizona callie alot tragedy like plane crash shoot episode etc literally comfort show also show we people change honestly change finish watch grey anatomy tho stop watch season favorite character either leave die overall great show really recommend
1	"Saying the f word every 3 words does not make your show edgy and cool. Swearing is not replacement for dialogue. Anyways,I've been a hardcore fan of the games for many many years and played everything from three to 76 and fallout shelter lol. I really really wanted to like that show but considering it was on Prime and the serious failure of other video game to TV adaptions I didn't have much hope and I really wasn't surprised when it was not that great and then happily surprised when it blossomed after episode 3. The show is excessively violent in the first episodes,to the point where it's not enjoyable to watch. It's a lot different playing a fake cartoonish looking video game and knowing that everything that you're doing in it is not real, and video game violence doesn't have the same visual and emotional impact as seeing a real life person's head exploding. That may be the world that they live in but there's no reason to watch it as ""entertainment"", it's just savage.. Not to mention it's an extremely lame excuse for not writing good stories and dialogue and just being like oh we'll just have them explode or be gutted that'll be fun right? Umm no.. Don't get me wrong the props,stages ,CGI and the power armor are great and accurate. Why is the brotherhood only men? Why is the brotherhood only men, it's not in the game. Why is there no trace of vault girl? I like the lead woman as she's so innocent and derpy that it's very comical and I like the ghoul, he's complicated ,he used to be good but he's turned so bitter/evil after living so long , being mangled,losing his family and knowing the truth. There's also the dark humor which I appreciate because that is a large part of fallout ,although it could be more dark funny and less goofy, but at least it's there. Maximus,siiighhhh. It's funny but he's also so annoying. The giant sack they haul around really made me laugh, over encumbered! They also made a mistake with the animals because they aren't bald /mutated but I do like the fact that they used real animals rather than animating them but they aren't accurate. If the second season is like episodes 4-8 then I'll watch it."	say f word every word make show edgy cool swear replacement dialogue anyways hardcore fan game many many year play everything three fallout shelter lol really really want like show consider prime serious failure video game tv adaption much hope really surprise great happily surprise blossom episode show excessively violent first episode point enjoyable watch lot different play fake cartoonish look video game know everything real video game violence visual emotional impact see real life person head explode may world live reason watch entertainment savage mention extremely lame excuse write good story dialogue like oh explode gutte fun right umm get wrong prop stag cgi power armor great accurate brotherhood man brotherhood man game trace vault girl like lead woman innocent derpy comical like ghoul complicate use good turn bitter evil live long mangle lose family know truth also dark humor appreciate large part fallout although could dark funny less goofy least maximus siiighhhh funny also annoy giant sack haul around really make laugh encumber also make mistake animal bald mutate like fact use real animal rather animate accurate second season like episode watch
0	The trailers gave me hope as the books when I read them years ago were a globe spanning scifi thriller with unique themes taking place across the years.The book itself created a universe where you didnt really need to change anything yet you would still get a global cast of characters and a cool story.Sadly that is not what we get here, in the first episode you get race and gender swapped characters sitting in a lesbian bar talking about how smart and independent they are followed by all of the usual DEI tripe that gets shoved into modern tv.The interesting stuff in china gets completely overshadowed by the inclusive and boring writing layered ontop of what could have been an interesting show.. Even the suspense around the fates of the scientists is downplayed in lieu of talking about how smart and independent the female minority leads are... good one guys.	trailer give hope book read year ago globe span scifi thriller unique theme take place across year book create universe do not really need change anything yet would still get global cast character cool story sadly get first episode get race gender swap character sit lesbian bar talk smart independent follow usual dei tripe get shove modern tv interest stuff china get completely overshadow inclusive bore write layer ontop could interest show even suspense around fat scientist downplay lieu talk smart independent female minority lead good one guy
2	This is quite difficult to watch sometimes and it's quite unpalatable but it's so fantastically well acted and written. It's compelling and everybody should watch it.The premise of a stalker interlinked with vulnerability and abuse. It's dark but real and a part of this which we would all identify with. Sometimes when it's uncomfortable, you have to continue and I didn't expect a binge watch five episodes at once but I've save the last episode for another day as I can imagine it I'll be disturbing and emotional but it will resonate with me and other people that take the time out to watch this brilliant series.	quite difficult watch sometimes quite unpalatable fantastically well act write compel everybody watch premise stalker interlink vulnerability abuse dark real part would identify sometimes uncomfortable continue expect binge watch five episode save last episode another day imagine disturb emotional resonate people take time watch brilliant series
0	During the first couple of episodes, the story deviated somewhat to the book although I didnt like, I understood.But cmon! The last two episodes is like throwing away the book and make a whole new story, great moments left out, Anjin never learns Japanese, the Mariko and Anjin relationship erased, they almost took out the Catholic plot line, the dead of Toranaga's son, and lastly Hiromatsu sepukku. All of those made me really dislike the show. If it works don't fix it, 1980 was far superior in the plot and acting, the book is a must for every fan of Feudal Japan, but this is an atrocity towards the book and so inferior to its predecessor.	first couple episode story deviate somewhat book although do not like understand cmon last two episode like throw away book make whole new story great moment leave anjin never learn japanese mariko anjin relationship erase almost take catholic plot line dead toranaga son lastly hiromatsu sepukku make really dislike show work fix far superior plot act book must every fan feudal japan atrocity towards book inferior predecessor
0	Seasons 6-7 were very bad but season 8 was beyond terrible. It's like they deliberately made it bad.Acting was great but the writing from season 6 went downhill. When you start a story with so many characters and mystical intricacies, you better have some kind of plan how they generally make sense at the end of the story. Maybe G Martin didn't and that's why he can't finish the books.The tv writers didn't for sure, after writing the tragic comedy of s8. Such a shame and preventable because even without the books and decent tv writer should be able to come up with a better last season than they have.	season bad season beyond terrible like deliberately make bad act great write season go downhill start story many character mystical intricacy well kind plan generally make sense end story maybe g martin finish book tv writer sure write tragic comedy shame preventable even without book decent tv writer able come well last season

1	"I remember my grandmother saying to me: I don't care what they tell you in school, Shogun was black. /s""Shogun"" is a riveting television series that breathes new life into the timeless tale of cultural clash and political intrigue set in feudal Japan. Released in 2024, this adaptation brings James Clavell's epic novel to the screen with a modern sensibility, offering a fresh perspective on the classic story.From its opening scenes, ""Shogun"" captivates audiences with its stunning visuals and meticulous attention to detail. The production design is nothing short of spectacular, transporting viewers to 17th-century Japan with breathtaking authenticity. From the ornate palaces of the samurai lords to the bustling streets of Edo, every aspect of the show's world-building is meticulously crafted to immerse viewers in the sights and sounds of feudal Japan.At the heart of ""Shogun"" are its characters, brought to life by a talented ensemble cast. In the role of John Blackthorne, the English navigator shipwrecked in Japan, viewers are treated to a nuanced and compelling performance by Cosmo Jarvis. His journey from outsider to insider, as he navigates the treacherous waters of Japanese politics and culture, forms the emotional core of the series. Alongside him, Anna Sawai delivers a standout performance as the enigmatic Lady Mariko, whose wisdom and strength serve as a guiding light for Blackthorne amidst the chaos of feudal Japan.What sets this adaptation of ""Shogun"" apart is its willingness to delve deeper into the complexities of cultural exchange and understanding. While the original novel and previous adaptations focused primarily on Blackthorne's perspective, this series offers a more balanced portrayal, giving voice to the Japanese characters and their experiences. Through their eyes, viewers gain insight into the rich tapestry of Japanese society - its customs, traditions, and underlying tensions - and come to appreciate the depth and complexity of the culture that Blackthorne encounters.In addition to its cultural themes, ""Shogun"" also delivers plenty of suspense and intrigue. The political machinations of the samurai clans, the rivalry between the wily Lord Toranaga and his ambitious rivals, and Blackthorne's own struggle for survival all combine to create a gripping narrative that keeps viewers hooked from episode to episode.Despite its sprawling scope, ""Shogun"" never loses sight of its central themes or characters. The pacing is brisk, the storytelling is tight, and each episode builds upon the last to create a cohesive and compelling narrative arc. Whether you're a fan of historical drama, political intrigue, or character-driven storytelling, ""Shogun"" offers something for everyone.In conclusion, ""Shogun"" is a triumph of television storytelling. With its stunning visuals, stellar performances, and thought-provoking themes, it transports viewers to a fascinating and exotic world while also offering profound insights into the nature of cultural exchange and understanding. Whether you're familiar with the story or experiencing it for the first time, ""Shogun"" is not to be missed."	remember grandmother say care tell school shogun black shogun rivet television series breathe new life timeless tale cultural clash political intrigue set feudal japan release adaptation bring jam clavell epic novel screen modern sensibility offer fresh perspective classic story open scene shogun captivate audience stun visual meticulous attention detail production design nothing short spectacular transport viewer th century japan breathtaking authenticity ornate palace samurai lord bustle streets edo every aspect show world build meticulously craft immerse viewer sight sound feudal japan heart shogun character bring life talente ensemble cast role john blackthorne english navigator shipwreck japan viewer treat nuance compel performance cosmo jarvis journey outsider insider navigate treacherous water japanese politic culture form emotional core series alongside anna sawai deliver standout performance enigmatic lady mariko whose wisdom strength serve guide light blackthorne amidst chaos feudal japan set adaptation shogun apart willingness delve deep complexity cultural exchange understand original novel previous adaptation focus primarily blackthorne perspective series offer balance portrayal give voice japanese character experience eye viewer gain insight rich tapestry japanese society customs tradition underlie tension come appreciate depth complexity culture blackthorne encounter addition cultural theme shogun also deliver plenty suspense intrigue political machination samurai clan rivalry wily lord toranaga ambitious rival blackthorne struggle survival combine create grip narrative keep viewer hook episode episode despite sprawl scope shogun never lose sight central theme character pace brisk storytelle tight episode build upon last create cohesive compel narrative arc whether fan historical drama political intrigue character drive storytelle shogun offer something everyone conclusion shogun triumph television storytelle stun visual stellar performance think provoke theme transport viewer fascinate exotic world also offer profound insight nature cultural exchange understand whether familiar story experience first time shogun miss

1	It's really a tacky adaptation to let the fanatical follower kill Jack. Immediately let this story slide to the Strange Thing level. If I want to watch the Strange Thing, I will watch the Strange Thing directly. // Why should the scriptwriter write about a romantic relationship between Wenjie Ye and Evans?? Does the big villain have to be crazy? This is very Netflix // After that (the plot progress exceeds the Chinese version) a few episodes are not bad. Xin Cheng's performance is too realistic, lifelike Virgin Mary. The rhythm is smooth, so as the plot progresses, and it is much more refreshing than the Chinese version.	really tacky adaptation let fanatical follower kill jack immediately let story slide strange thing level want watch strange thing watch strange thing directly scriptwriter write romantic relationship wenjie ye evans big villain crazy netflix plot progress exceed chinese version episode bad xin cheng performance realistic lifelike virgin mary rhythm smooth plot progress much refresh chinese version

0	Never read the book but had some friends who did and were excited about these series.So I watched the show on Netflix and my own impressions were: a) Didn't feel at all like a $20M/episode budget that they spent. Where did the money go?B) Overall OK and somewhat interesting, mainly due to lack of other new Sci-Fi shows with some level of originality.C) Lots of plot holes, logical issues, bad science that's basically magic, some facts magically appearing without taking time to solve problems and mysteries, lack of answers to many questions, and other issues that made me assume that the book was quite bad.D) Too much DEI, with the show not driven by pure talent but by the need to satisfy political requirements.But then I've decided to watch the Chinese series based on the same book, playing on Amazon Video. And that's when I realized how much better the Chinese version is at only $1M/episode. That one does feel like little lower budget but not big much. And is is very slow-paced at 30 episodes (for Season 1), but it does have much better story with actual mysteries being discovered and then solved, vs magically appearing facts and problems in the American/Netflix version.Now I've lost all respect for this Netflix show, just by knowing how much better, logical and mysterious it could be. Basically I'm very disappointed with Netflix screwing this show so badly.	never read book friend excite series watch show netflix impression feel like episode budget spend money go b overall ok somewhat interest mainly due lack new sci fi show level originality c lot plot hole logical issue bad science basically magic fact magically appear without take time solve problem mystery lack answer many question issue make assume book quite bad much dei show drive pure talent need satisfy political requirement decide watch chinese series base book play amazon video realize much well chinese version episode one feel like little low budget big much slow pace episode season much well story actual mystery discover solve vs magically appear fact problem american netflix version lose respect netflix show know much well logical mysterious could basically disappoint netflix screw show badly
2	Look I might be biased. In fact, I am biased because I have read the three books of the series and I think they are one of the best thing I have read in a long long time.When it comes to adaptations I am always skeptical because you never know how it would turn out. When I heard that the producers of Game of Thrones were behing the series I had hope, I thought they were going to do some justice to the source material, but I am glad to inform that they have surpase all my expectations.The one scene regarding an oil tanker (I will say no more), it was not done just right, it was freaking glorius, they pull it off and them some.I know they took some liberties regarding the nationality of the characters nut I understand the decisions that were made.The production was top notch, money well spend Netflix.The adaptation to the books (this first season included material from the first two books) was faithful as far as I remember.Acting was very good (special mention to the head of intellegence), cinematography and special effects were on point. You can tell they pull all the stops.I just can't wait for second season, peaple who has not read the books just do not know what they have in store for them.These books are not about the plot (in my humble opinión), they are about ideas, they introduce you to new and very interesting concepts about physics, game theory and even human nature in a way that is just mesmerizing, the wallfacer concept, just wow.I am sure this is a hit for Netflix and second season is already on the works.	look might bias fact bias read three book series think one good thing read long long time come adaptation always skeptical never know would turn hear producer game throne behe series hope think go justice source material glad inform surpase expectation one scene regard oil tanker say do right freak glorius pull know take liberty regard nationality character nut understand decision make production top notch money well spend netflix adaptation book first season include material first two book faithful far remember act good special mention head intellegence cinematography special effect point tell pull stop wait second season peaple read book know store book plot humble opini n idea introduce new interest concept physics game theory even human nature way mesmerize wallfacer concept wow sure hit netflix second season already work
1	"There is nothing science about this science fiction. The premise is intriguing but from there goes downhill faster than Game of thrones from season 6 to 8.The suspense is revealed very early on and after that it is like independence day/ Armageddon or any other 90s alien invasion movie you can think of.The supposedly greatest scientist characters are so unnatural that it is painful to watch. Same with one British cop who is calling the shots on everything about a war that is more than global.Even the aliens are pretty naive. They talk with human SPOC for decades before realising that we ""lie"" and then decide to eradicate us?Really? The hell were you listening for tens of years?Every twist takes it one step away from intelligent science fiction.

2	I was skeptical when I first started watching the show but its so good. Jessica Gunning is such a great actor and really portrays the stalker as crazy as they can be.It really delves into the mind of someone who has suffered from abuse and how a simple hello can lead to drastic consequences. It is one of the best mini-series that I have watched and has just the right amount of episodes.It has many twists and turns and keeps the viewer gripped. It's not really for young kids to watch but I would definitely recommend it for adults. There is some scenes in it that are viewer sensitive but overall a really great series.	skeptical first start watch show good jessica gun great actor really portray stalker crazy really delve mind someone suffer abuse simple hello lead drastic consequence one good mini series watch right amount episode many twist turn keep view grip really young kid watch would definitely recommend adult scene viewer sensitive overall really great series

1	I cannot understand why this show has such a high IMDB rating. It is ponderously slow with not a lot happening. I loved this book but this version isn't a patch on the book or the previous version. It's beautifully filmed with stunning scenery and amazing set design and settings but that's about its only positive.One of the major problems is that the actor playing the main character can't act. He delivers his lines in a tedious monotone showing little expression. This has had a huge impact on the entire production. His name is Cosmo Jarvis, they would have been better off with Cosmo Kramer.I have watched 6 episodes hoping it would get better but I won't be persisting any more. There is too much good stuff around.This is ridiculously overrated and isn't in the same class as numerous other shows with similar scores.	understand show high imdb rat ponderously slow lot happen love book version patch book previous version beautifully film stun scenery amaze set design setting positive one major problem actor play main character act deliver line tedious monotone show little expression huge impact entire production name cosmo jarvis would well cosmo kramer watch episode hop would get well persist much good stuff around ridiculously overrate class numerous show similar score
0	The show is so uneven and uninteresting. I'd go as far as saying it's one of the most unengaging series I've seen in a very long time. The actors are terrible, except for one actor who gets killed off in the first few episodes. Some of the acting is just plain wooden (for instance the Navy officer). There are a 2-3 thrilling VFX scenes but apart from that the show is very dialogue heavy and a lot of it is just badly written. There are so many scenes that are stretched out for no reason and you could easily fast forward the whole series and still not miss any crucial plot points. Honestly I watched it because of all the hype, that's 8 hours of my life I'll never get back!	show uneven uninteresting go far say one unengage series see long time actor terrible except one actor get kill first episode act plain wooden instance navy officer thrill vfx scene apart show dialogue heavy lot badly write many scene stretch reason could easily fast forward whole series still miss crucial plot point honestly watch hype hour life never get back

It is all so Helter-Skelter... a moment of craziness from the distant past. 9/11 flashbacks??? Really?? 21 years later? Talk about postponing dealing with a terrible event! I get having flashbacks this far in the future, but where did this all go in the intervening years? I'm sorry...but is just all too bizarre...the Meredith, Deluca, Derrick (etc etc) psychic/psychotic episodes. If it was just all dealing with Meredith's psyche due to her condition...but everyone seems to be struggling here! Are we really supposed to accept that it all derived from the Covid fiasco? Really? Come on!The good: seeing Derrick again.

But jon was provoked to kill the queen but no one has even uttered his name to make him as king. He is the only person who has the concern and mercy for the people yo be the king.3rd what quality does the bran has to be the king? 3 persons sacrificed themselves to save him, but bran doesnt even has any sympathy for them, he was carried along by the mercy and love of others. He can be made as kings(Jon) hand.Please re do the final season, we invest our time for this, we do deserve a better ending.	well good last season esp final two episode take away fame thin air hour investment think deserve well end st jon would never kill person like accord character develop nd jon snow person look king quality king jon provoke kill queen one even utter name make king person concern mercy people yo king rd quality bran king person sacrifice save bran do not even sympathy carry along mercy love other make king jon hand please final season invest time deserve well end
1	Greed. There you go! I could end it right here.It's pretty much common knowledge that the creators of the show were offered a deal with Disney to make Star Wars content.Yet when they decided to prematurely rush the end of the show, in order to pursue their changing career goals, they never even considered handing the reigns to someone motivated and talented, to allow the story beats their necessary breathing room. We're talking at least 3 seasons.No way! They had to be the ones to close the book and take all the credit.After the dust settled, and people picked themselves up from the trauma of witnessing the utter annihilation of their beloved characters identities and arcs, they cried out in unison to have these blasphemers vanquished.Which resulted in them becoming known as the murderers of what could have been one of the greatest and most impactful shows of all time.Unfortunately, because of the show's structure, the damage is beyond repair. Most of the characters lead nowhere. Most of the story leads nowhere. Most of the setups shrivel and die before your very eyes.Because of their actions motivated by greed, there is barely a reason to watch Game of Thrones in its entirety. Not unless you don't mind watching a parody of the show you just viewed for tens of hours to close out the experience.There are some episodes that work great in isolation. There are some great scenes and some great spectacle. Maybe if you prepare yourself for immense disappointment it might be digestible.The only satisfaction, for me at least, is knowing that the creators lost their Star Wars deal and became branded as greedy hacks who thrived on some truly talented people's hard work and still managed to fu** it all up.	greed go could end right pretty much common knowledge creator show offer deal disney make star war content yet decide prematurely rush end show order pursue change career goal never even consider hand reign someone motivate talented allow story beat necessary breathe room talk least season way one close book take credit dust settle people pick trauma witness utter annihilation beloved character identity arc cry unison blasphemer vanquish result become know murderer could one great impactful show time unfortunately show structure damage beyond repair character lead nowhere story lead nowhere setup shrivel die eye action motivate greed barely reason watch game throne entirety unless mind watch parody show view ten hour close experience episode work great isolation great scene great spectacle maybe prepare immense disappointment might digestible satisfaction least know creator lose star war deal become brand greedy hack thrive truly talented people hard work still manage fu

0	Imagine a Medical show where you take out the wit of Scrubs, the excitement of E.R., and the drama of St. Elsewhere, and you'll start to get the feeling of what this show is all about. From the bland acting of Ellen Pompeo, to the pseudo-indie rock (Portions for Foxes by Rilo Kiley) that blares through every scene, this show is definitely aimed at the 18-35 year old demographic who happen to have penchants for over-acting and scripts filled with melodrama. I can't get over how everyone seems to be enthralled with a show that basically comes up with the worst catchphrases in the world, AND THEN RUNS WITH THEM. Why does America tune in every week for a show that makes The O.C. look like it was written by James Joyce. Mcdreamy? Mcsteamy?

0	I was very surprised to see that in the low-rating reviews people often complained about the multitude of sex scenes, but nobody about the sequences that show explicit acts of murder, violence, aggression, rapes, animal cruelty... I agree, there is too much sex and naked women, but hey, are we already so desensitized as human beings, that those disgusting scenes are not a problem? My stomach is still confused. I had to cover my eyes at every 2 scenes. If children grow with this kind of evening movies it is just wrong. Also, the characters were developed superficially, in a poor manner. They were childishly divided between extremely good and extremely evil. If the movie is very accurate and realistic, why these non-realistic people? My two stars go for the costumes and settings.	surprise see low rat review people often complain multitude sex scene nobody sequence show explicit act murder violence aggression rap animal cruelty agree much sex naked woman hey already desensitize human be disgust scene problem stomach still confuse cover eye every scene child grow kind even movie wrong also character develop superficially poor manner childishly divide extremely good extremely evil movie accurate realistic non realistic people two star go costume setting

0	The pace of this series is way to fast! The Chinese version, though deleted so much content about Cultural Revolution, however it's pace is alright, the story unravels slowly and mystery being solved one at the time so it always got you attracted to the story.The biggest problem of this series is very similar to many Netflix series: They poured lot's of money in it, but there seems no quality control, so the scripts are always unchecked and nobody knows where the director comes from and then it always feels like the series is used for making quick cash and they never intended to make a sequel to this series, so the quality is always not so good and the rating is always quite low.	pace series way fast chinese version though delete much content cultural revolution however pace alright story unravel slowly mystery solve one time always get attract story big problem series similar many netflix series pour lot money seem quality control script always unchecked nobody know director come always feel like series use make quick cash never intend make sequel series quality always good rat always quite low

Season 1/2 were normal right wing then in season 3 the writers start introducing woke themes and just keep going.

2	"Baby Reindeer has been receiving some great reviews, and I am going to add to that body of opinion.It was written by, and stars, Richard Gadd but with a supreme supporting performance by Jessica Gunning as Gadd's stalker Martha. In the stage shows, which provided the inspiration for this 7 part Netflix series, Gadd makes it crystal clear that it is an autobiographical story, in the TV adaptation this is less apparent. But it is all trueWe saw the Edinburgh Festival Fringe productions of Monkey See Monkey Do in 2017, at Summerhall, and Baby Reindeer in 2019, also at Summerhall but in the Roundabout.My wife is not always the most likely to join a standing ovation at a theatre show but at Monkey See Monkey do she was the first on their feet. I gave both productions five stars and this nearly gets the same, apart from the fact that Gadd as a stage performer, telling his life story, is arguably better than Gadd as an actor playing a character, based on him, but actually is him, Donny Dunn. This subtle change takes some of the edge off his performance and requires him to act rather than perform. They are different things. I'm niggling though.A big difference is that the stage shows were both one man monologues, albeit with AV back up, whereas he is graced with a supporting cast here, not least the miraculous performance by his stalker Martha who inhabits this sweet-as-sugar character with a dangerous she-devil interior that only raises its head when she's not getting her way, and her way would be to own and ravish Gadd.Gadd's second nemesis is the theatre impresario Darrien played impeccably by Tom Goodman-Hill who subjects Gadd to massive trauma and was the main antagonist in Monkey See Monkey Do.The combination of Darrien and Martha, and their collective trauma, create a stultifying inability for Gadd to do anything about his situation. His pathetic attempts at stand up comedy make any positive interest, from anyone, yes anyone, appealing at a subconscious level to Gadd and that may be why he rolls with the punches for so long against enemies that seem, to the viewer, so obviously easy to unlock himself from - but this is the way poor mental health and low self esteem can manifest themselves.Whilst most of us could easily disassociate ourselves with these two monsters Gadd simply cannot and finds himself descending into blacker and blacker territory.His only escape is through the fourth key character, the Mexican trans-actress Nava Mau, who plays Gadd's sort of girlfriend, although it's not easy. Gadd's sexuality is so confused that he simply doesn't know what he's looking for and it makes for a pretty challenging relationship.It's billed as a black comedy and there are comedic moments, and yes, Gadd, is a professional comedian. But don't come to this looking for laughs. It's a profound, original and true exploration of the stultifying impacts of poor mental health and it's performed with sensitivity and great skill.Surely the year will end up with this on all the top ten lists, in much the same way that ""I May Destroy You"" did.It's quite simply brilliant."	baby reindeer receive great review go add body opinion write star richard gadd supreme support performance jessica gun gadd stalker martha stage show provide inspiration part netflix series gadd make crystal clear autobiographical story tv adaptation less apparent truewe see edinburgh festival fringe production monkey see monkey summerhall baby reindeer also summerhall roundabout wife always likely join stand ovation theatre show monkey see monkey first foot give production five star nearly get apart fact gadd stage performer tell life story arguably well gadd actor play character base actually donny dunn subtle change take edge performance require act rather perform different thing niggle though big difference stage show one man monologue albeit av back whereas grace support cast least miraculous performance stalker martha inhabit sweet sugar character dangerous devil interior raise head get way way would ravish gadd gadd second nemesis theatre impresario darrien play impeccably tom goodman hill subject gadd massive trauma main antagonist monkey see monkey combination darrien martha collective trauma create stultify inability gadd anything situation pathetic attempt stand comedy make positive interest anyone yes anyone appeal subconscious level gadd may roll punch long enemy seem view obviously easy unlock way poor mental health low self esteem manifest whilst we could easily disassociate two monster gadd simply find descend blacker blacker territory escape fourth key character mexican trans actress nava mau play gadd sort girlfriend although easy gadd sexuality confuse simply know look make pretty challenge relationship bill black comedy comedic moment yes gadd professional comedian come look laugh profound original true exploration stultify impact poor mental health perform sensitivity great skill surely year end top ten list much way may destroy quite simply brilliant
0	Firstly, the writing is all over the place and this is affecting the overall narrative which staggers and stumbles from one scene to the next.There is no pacing whatsoever, no flow to the story. It's as if somebody chopped semi-random parts from the book and filmed them.Not sure why some people are rating it so highly, I naturally realise that tastes differ but what is so appealing about this mess of an adaptation? For me at least there's just nothing to like. The acting is often weak, the casting for the main characters is mostly poor and why is everything so dull and gloomy? Of course, it was filmed in Canada ......Now compare and contrast to the 1980 miniseries - fantastic flow to the story, pretty much perfect casting and it also looks great, you can actually SEE the scenery, the buildings, the characters. AND it was all filmed in Japan.Of course, thanks to the power of the media this new adaptation will get a lot of accolades, but it really doesn't deserve them.I was looking forward to this but I'm extremely disappointed.	firstly write place affect overall narrative stagger stumble one scene next pace whatsoever flow story somebody chop semi random part book film sure people rat highly naturally realise taste differ appeal mess adaptation least nothing like act often weak cast main character mostly poor everything dull gloomy course film canada compare contrast miniserie fantastic flow story pretty much perfect cast also look great actually see scenery build character film japan course thank power medium new adaptation get lot accolade really deserve look forward extremely disappoint
2	Stairs, a lot of stairs, more stairs. Just when you think the scenes involving stairs have concluded, and there's no possibility for more, another set appears. But this repetition makes sense as a beautiful metaphor for life's unfairness, the constant climbs and challenges, mirroring the central character's journey.'Ripley', at its core, features a social climber who is also a sociopath, a forger, a thief, and a murderer. This version of Patricia Highsmith's probably most famous character is darker than Matt Damon's portrayal in Anthony Minghella's 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' - more distant, calculating, and deliberate in pursuing what his social milieu denied him.His queerness is present, yet not as emphasized as in the 1999 film. The object of his obsession - the rich and slothful, utterly talentless Richard Greenleaf, aka Dickie - lacks the charms and attractiveness of young Jude Law's portrayal. This Dickie is merely another wealthy individual who crosses paths with Andrew Scott's Thomas Ripley, setting the stage for inevitable tragedy.The new Netflix series 'Ripley' offers a deep character study, staying truer to Highsmith's original material and vision than the eponymous film. It revels in slow pacing, meticulous attention to details and context. The characters are as crucial as the environments they navigate, the objects they covet, gift, or steal, making every element essential in this chilling narrative. Even Lucio, the Roman cat, becomes an unwitting accomplice in one of Ripley's elaborate crimes.The series' black-and-white aesthetic is as thick and luscious as molasses, adding layers of visual meaning. The clear inspiration from Caravaggio's dramatic chiaroscuro is aptly chosen, reflecting the blurred lines between criminality and artistry that Caravaggio himself embodied, which resonates deeply within the narrative. Who was Caravaggio? Who is Ripley? Can having a criminal mind also be a talent? Is there something inherently criminal in being an artist?Andrew Scott excels in portraying the emptiness within Ripley, akin to a black hole that swallows and crushes anything in its path.In a current landscape filled with mundane streaming content, 'Ripley' stands out as a gasp of fresh air, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in both the beauty and horror of this ever-elusive story.John Malkovich's cameo as a shady art dealer in the final episode set in Venice adds a sublime layer of self-referentiality within the Ripley universe. Malkovich, who portrayed an older version of Ripley in Liliana Cavani's 2002 film 'Ripley's Game', enriches the series with his presence, delighting both film lovers and Highsmith aficionados.Exquisitely diabolical.	stair lot stair stair think scene involve stair conclude possibility another set appear repetition make sense beautiful metaphor life unfairness constant climb challenge mirror central character journey ripley core feature social climber also sociopath forger thief murderer version patricia highsmith probably famous character darker matt damon portrayal anthony minghella talente mr ripley distant calculate deliberate pursue social milieu deny queerness present yet emphasize film object obsession rich slothful utterly talentless richard greenleaf aka dickie lack charm attractiveness young jude law portrayal dickie merely another wealthy individual cross path andrew scott thomas ripley set stage inevitable tragedy new netflix series ripley offer deep character study stay truer highsmith original material vision eponymous film revel slow pace meticulous attention detail context character crucial environment navigate object covet gift steal make every element essential chill narrative even lucio roman cat become unwitting accomplice one ripley elaborate crime series black white aesthetic thick luscious molasse add layer visual mean clear inspiration caravaggio dramatic chiaroscuro aptly choose reflect blur line criminality artistry caravaggio embody resonate deeply within narrative caravaggio ripley criminal mind also talent something inherently criminal artist andrew scott excel portray emptiness within ripley akin black hole swallow crush anything path current landscape fill mundane stream content ripley stand gasp fresh air invite viewer immerse beauty horror ever elusive story john malkovich cameo shady art dealer final episode set venice add sublime layer self referentiality within ripley universe malkovich portray old version ripley liliana cavani film ripley game enrich series presence delight film lover highsmith aficionado exquisitely diabolical

The theme tune for this should be ""Rule Britannia"", It's so pro-british it's unwatchable for me, and has all the usual cliques.

1	Before this season, I would have given this series a 10/10. For several years many fans gave their loyalty to watching this magnificent tv series only to have been so let down in the final season. Every episode of season 8 revealed the inability for these writers to continue to truly deliver the calibre of writing they gave the series to this point in keeping with the books. Unfortunately the writers have totally disenchanted fans to the point that they will not invest the time into any other series they put their pen to, especially any sort of spinoff they may contrive from the GOT series which is sad. I would have followed their work anywhere until this season of GOT aired which showed that they truly needed a book to follow so that they could simply write a script with the ideas already laid out before them. They have proved without a book, they were lost without any imagination as to how the series should end. The actors, and all other staff working on the series should be commended for producing some of the best tv in history as they did a superb job. Truly disappointed in the final season and left feeling like something was missing - yes, in fact there was, George R. R. Martin's book to guide them.	season would give series several year many fan give loyalty watch magnificent tv series let final season every episode season reveal inability writer continue truly deliver calibre write give series point keep book unfortunately writer totally disenchant fan point inv time series put pen especially sort spinoff may contrive get series sad would follow work anywhere season get air show truly need book follow could simply write script idea already lie prove without book lose without imagination series end actor staff work series commend produce good tv history superb job truly disappoint final season leave feel like something miss yes fact george r r martin book guide
1	"Short review: The series are ok, but feels rushed, reduced to a bunch of characters that know each other and to (mostly) a single place on earth. Entertaining, good sci fi ideas, but feels otherwise shallow and small.Long version: Here, we got the trilogy of the scifi chinese novels ""The Three Body Problem"" as a foundation and core ideas of the plot. I read the back half a decade ago, so I had forgotten lots of it, and I saw the series almost as a newcomer to it.I won't spoil plot details, but it is well known the story deals with a future alien threat for humanity. That core idea, and most of the responses to it and the scifi concepts from the book are brought pretty well to the series. And they are done in an entertaining way. All good so far.Now, the problem of the series falls in other areas like the scale, the pace and the characters/casting. All of them, I get the feeling, from a lack of budget.Scale: Remember the magnitude and the feeling of ""epic"" scale scifi tv series like Battlestar Galactica or V ? Where everything was a stake? Where multiple characters from different parts wouldn't meet each other for seasons? That's lost here: 90% of the series happens in London/around London, and it is shot in a way that often feels more like a soap opera than a sci series. The same establishing shots all the time, mostly indoors, barely any extras, when outdoors just small streets. They might as well been shooting in a stage. The book involved a lot more travelling, things happening in parallel in US/Europe/China; giving us an adventure feeling and a bigger scale to it.Pace: most of other series are filled with stuff to drag them longer. This one isn't. But not in a good way that would make the show lean and smooth. In this case just feels like a lack of patience and budget to explain or show things, to know our characters, to let it grow on you: scenes are unconnected, characters jump from emotion to emotion without continuity, stuff just seem to happen. There isn't much character development, there isn't much tension, there isn't any mystery.Characters: truly the novels just had the 3-4 main charactera developed, while the secondary characters were more stereotypes without much deep. The tv series doesn't get much better. It mades things worse by making the main characters old classmates, and losing the more independent timelines and stories that would eventually cross each other in more epic shows.The story could've been slightly slower, with more emphasis on the characters and build the tension and mystery. Things, events and characters should've been given more distance, giving us more scale and variety/diversity of POV and environments. The only exception to this was the flashback storyline in the first 2 episodes, that feels a whole different level and was clearly done with care. Netflix, however, wasn't as confident on the IP's success and didn't made it was well as this could've been. I wonder if that will eventually mean its own demise. Sad. This one could've been great."	short review series ok feel rush reduce bunch character know mostly single place earth entertain good sci fi idea feel otherwise shallow small long version get trilogy scifi chinese novel three body problem foundation core idea plot read back half decade ago forget lot see series almost newcomer spoil plot detail well know story deal future alien threat humanity core idea response scifi concept book bring pretty well series do entertain way good far problem series fall area like scale pace character cast get feel lack budget scale remember magnitude feel epic scale scifi tv series like battlestar galactica v everything stake multiple character different part meet season lose series happen london around london shoot way often feel like soap opera sci series establish shot time mostly indoor barely extra outdoors small street might well shoot stage book involve lot travel thing happen parallel us europe china give we adventure feel big scale pace series fill stuff drag long one good way would make show lean smooth case feel like lack patience budget explain show thing know character let grow scene unconnected character jump emotion emotion without continuity stuff seem happen much character development much tension mystery character truly novel main charactera develop secondary character stereotype without much deep tv series get much well made thing bad make main character old classmate lose independent timeline story would eventually cross epic show story could slightly slow emphasis character build tension mystery thing event character give distance give we scale variety diversity pov environment exception flashback storyline first episode feel whole different level clearly do care netflix however confident ip success make well could wonder eventually mean demise sad one could great
2	I think this is a very good series, during one episode you can feel so many different emotions. I think it's sad that so many characters from the original cast gets killed of or disapears from the show but that's understandable because of the timeline. The show extends like 10 or more years and life change a lot in a few years. I like the current cast as well. The series has so many seasons and everything can't always stay the same. Some people that dies makes the series more exiting and You feel so many different emotions	think good series one episode feel many different emotion think sad many character original cast get kill disapear show understandable timeline show extend like year life change lot year like current cast well series many season everything always stay people die make series exit feel many different emotion
0	***Spoilers Included***Bit late to the party with this show, but where do I even start with it? Never in my life have I seen such an cripplingly depressing programme. It's just one horrible outcome after another between the patients and the lives of the characters. Even when you think a story arc might actually meet a pleasant conclusion, they somehow find a way snatch it away at the death ('death' being the operative word).While this might be presented as a medical drama, ultimately, it is nothing more than a big-budget soap opera. The goings on in the show are so ridiculously far-fetched that it's hard to believe that much of it could be considered as an accurate portrayal of life in a hospital emergency room. The characters are the most self- destructive people imaginable. They refuse to allow any positivity into their lives, and regularly sabotage their own happiness. They're all either sleeping with each other, falling out with each other, or sleeping with each other and then falling out with each other.The death toll in this show is also comical. Don't work at the hospital, you'll die. Don't get admitted to the hospital as a patient, you'll die. Don't even get involved with someone who has been anywhere near the hospital, you will probably die. They've killed off enough main characters to make Game of Thrones blush. There's been plane crashes, gun-toting maniacs, car accidents, and countless other occurrences that have seen a couple of predominant characters get bumped off every season on average (I've seen war films with a higher survival rate). The ones that are lucky enough to survive - at least in the short term - are treated to such joys as seeing loved ones die instead, getting divorced, or miscarrying (wonderful!)In closing - if you want to watch a show that will make you feel utterly horrible for 90%+ of the time you watch it, and has a cast of characters that are hell-bent on repeatedly destroying any chances they might have at happiness, then this is absolutely the show for you.	spoiler include bite late party show even start never life see cripplingly depress programme one horrible outcome another patient live character even think story arc might actually meet pleasant conclusion somehow find way snatch away death death operative word might present medical drama ultimately nothing big budget soap opera go show ridiculously far fetch hard believe much could consider accurate portrayal life hospital emergency room character self destructive people imaginable refuse allow positivity live regularly sabotage happiness either sleep fall sleep fall death toll show also comical work hospital die get admit hospital patient die even get involve someone anywhere near hospital probably die kill enough main character make game throne blush plane crash gun tot maniac car accident countless occurrence see couple predominant character get bump every season average see war film high survival rate one lucky enough survive least short term treat joy see love one die instead get divorce miscarry wonderful close want watch show make feel utterly horrible time watch cast character hell bend repeatedly destroy chance might happiness absolutely show
0	If you watch the tencent series there is little you cannot love. I wish more shows were done like that: faithful and sensible. If you read the books then the Chinese tv series is the thing you were looking for because it captures the detail, spirit and essence of the books. It that had come out of Hollywood it would have cost the namesake: ten cents to the dollar compared to this tripe! But, no! Hollywood says let's make it better by taking two people most famous for massacring the last four seasons of game of thrones which are widely acknowledged to be the most anticlimactic television ever. Why? Because the show runners had run out of book material so they decided to improvise. That's when you see the difference between real writers and wannabes.A good analogy for this show and Hollywood's general attitudes would be to throw money at the wall like talentless social media chefs and see if the spaghetti sticks. It's the trope checklist over quality: every single trope has one representative. One must ask the very basic and stupid question: why do you think you can write better dialogue then exceptional authors like GRR Martin and Liu Cixin? Result: a senseless series which deconstructs everything - dialogue, plot, and characters. Final result? A broken ming vase put together by a blind horse.	watch tencent series little love wish show do like faithful sensible read book chinese tv series thing look capture detail spirit essence book come hollywood would cost namesake ten cent dollar compare tripe hollywood say let make well take two people famous massacre last four season game throne widely acknowledge anticlimactic television ever show runner run book material decide improvise see difference real writer wannabe good analogy show hollywood general attitude would throw money wall like talentless social medium chef see spaghetti stick trope checklist quality every single trope one representative one must ask basic stupid question think write well dialogue exceptional author like grr martin liu cixin result senseless series deconstruct everything dialogue plot character final result break ming vase put together blind horse
1	For a series with this hype, it's incredible to see some historical errors that any amateur historian could solve. 1 - The boats, whether Japanese, Dutch or Portuguese, are not those that appear in the series. 2 - Some costumes, particularly Western ones, don't either. 3 - But even more ridiculous is that we have an English sailor, on board a Dutch ship, who arrives in a small Japanese village where he meets a Japanese translator who only speaks Portuguese but who translates into English. The Portuguese are supposed to be the villains - forgeting the fact that in Japan they were just traders who almost never left the port - but not a word of their language is heard in the entire show or even any correct historic representation of them. Ridiculous. This is a show made for english speaking people with a disney like historical knowlege.	series hype incredible see historical error amateur historian could solve boat whether japanese dutch portuguese appear series costume particularly western one either even ridiculous english sailor board dutch ship arrive small japanese village meet japanese translator speak portuguese translate english portuguese suppose villain forget fact japan trader almost never leave port word language hear entire show even correct historic representation ridiculous show make english speak people disney like historical knowlege
1	"For one thing, in a hospital, surgeons don't do rounding on patients, general doctors do. Surgeons consult the doctors patients. They remain detached from the patients so they can make difficult decisions related to care without emotion being a factor. They consult with the general physicians and nurses on the floor who do the bulk of labor of the hospital. Much of this is over the hospital computer network. Surgical staff have a massive case load and show up sparingly. Many times they don't even speak to the patients.There is no chief of surgery in most hospitals, they simply have surgical departments headed by doctors and a hospital board that consists of doctors. Patients are issued to surgeons by computer and the doctors on call send them cases for consultation. By the time you get to be a surgeon in a major hospital you are pretty much an institution, much bigger than any one hospital.On call rooms are rare, only prevalent in the emergency room areas and are there for the on call trauma doctors and surgeons. You won't find them much in upper floors. Surgeons have their own offices and staff and are rarely on site. Hospital floors are also broken up by purpose. There is a whole floor for surgical prep and if a person is getting scans, that is a whole floor is where he will be. The patient is moved, not the doctors. It isn't a hotel full of rooms with people coming to them.Finally, things in hospitals don't move as fast as this. They take time, drugs are scanned into charts from bar codes on the patient as well as the pharmacy inventory.They don't just grab a syringe out of a drawer and got to town. This would never happen. Nor would any major drugs or syringes be lying around in drawers. This is carefully inventoried by pharmaceutical staff.Charts have been on computer data bases since the mid 1990s with rolling computer carts. I'm not sure where this binder thing comes from.They don't have big rooms of supplies you can pillage. It's all dispensed by pharmacy code. Bar coded and assigned.Also, I love the characters and acting, but the situations and the patient reactions are stupid sometimes. Family members just don't react like this. They don't get upset with medical staff. Surgeons don't have so much pressure on them that they get traumatized by losses and go off to a trailer in the woods to sulk for days or need to have months of therapy to ""handle the pain."" The shows writing on that point is pure idiocy. It just doesn't happen.This show is a TV drama that is supposed to hold a line beyond mere ""soap opera"" standards. Yet this isn't the case. It sacrifices accuracy for direct conflict where there isn't any. It paints a picture of medicine that is also unreal. The speed of the prep for surgery is one thing. Surgery is in many cases a last ditch effort to save a life, this show throws surgery around like it's a trip to the market. Not the case. Prep can take days, emergent surgery is rare. Most surgeons won't ever see one unless it's part of a major trauma and most of those don't survive. They are slow and methodical and deliberate in everything they do.In all, I think a person having watched this show and then being in an actual hospital for even a short period would find this show inaccurate to an embarrassing amount.

1	Does anyone else find him almost impossible to watch? Why is he channeling Dustin Hoffman in Hook, it's distractingly bad and I'm only halfway through episode 1.... I am keeping an open mind for the rest of the series but I really have to say, this guy was so poorly cast for this role. If all the white male actors in Hollywood.Despite this one painfully distracting stubbed toe of a flaw, the rest of the casting is fantastic and it's clearly a good looking series. Well shot, cinematography is on point. The Portuguese turned to English is kind of annoying in this day and age but oh well. Can't have it all.	anyone else find almost impossible watch channel dustin hoffman hook distractingly bad halfway episode keep open mind rest series really say guy poorly cast role white male actor hollywood despite one painfully distract stub toe flaw rest cast fantastic clearly good look series well shoot cinematography point portuguese turn english kind annoy day age oh well

2	I love Nathan Fillion. Firefly is simply awesome, Castle was pretty enjoyable too. But The Rookie is a disappointment. Three episodes into the first season, I see no depth -- about anything. The police cases are universally shallow, not one of them had any intrigue or surprise. The larger narrative arc (middle-aged man joins police force) simply follows preconceptions and stereotypes. The personal relationships have not added to quality story-telling either. Much of it feels action-crammed and rushed. As of today (14 Nov 2018), the show has a rating of 8.0 -- which either vastly overvalues what I have seen or represents highly optimistic hopes for future potential. At this stage, the show is boring and meh. Someone as talented as Nathan deserves far better material, and so does the audience. Rating it 6/10 is pushing it.UPDATE 12/2018: Took a while, but as of episode 7 the quality improved considerably. No more shallow rookie hazing, finally some character depth. People you can and want to relate to. But episode 8 really got it rolling. Interesting perspective on what the job does to you, nicely done. I hope the writers keep giving the cast that kind of material, they must love the opportunity to apply their skills and talent. If this quality is permanent, it's a winner. Upping my rating to 8/10.	love nathan fillion firefly simply awesome castle pretty enjoyable rookie disappointment three episode first season see depth anything police case universally shallow one intrigue surprise large narrative arc middle age man join police force simply follow preconception stereotype personal relationship add quality story tell either much feel action cram rush today nov show rat either vastly overvalue see represent highly optimistic hop future potential stage show bore meh someone talente nathan deserve far well material audience rat push update take episode quality improve considerably shallow rookie haze finally character depth people want relate episode really get roll interest perspective job nicely do hope writer keep give cast kind material must love opportunity apply skill talent quality permanent winner up rat
1	"As someone who has spent countless hours across all the Fallout games, I was very nervous when they announced this project. Videogame adaptations tend to be extremely disrespectful to their source material and try to do their own thing which, almost all of the time, turns out for the worse. So I am very thankful that the Fallout show carefully crafts its original narrative with proper admiration for the source material. Being canon does hurt the overall lore, and depending on how much you liked the stuff it poorly handles, you might loathe the show.The show opens with Cooper Howard, with this one short scene done right before the bombs fell and destroyed the world, it's a very effective scene that gets you invested early on. Right after that they have a short scene introducing Lucy which is a nod to all the skills of the series. A bit after that, they show different vault dwellers interacting, I won't disclose much here as these interactions show how different the residents of every vault can be, which is another thing nicely adapted from the games. I do find the marriage subplot of the opening to be a bit too cringe-worthy for my taste, but hey it is something that feels straight out of Fallout 2. Lastly, they introduce the brotherhood character of the show, Maximus, and they do a really good job with him as well. I think fans of Fallout 1, 2, and 3 would really dig Lucy as the lead. I, myself do find her good but her ""romantic"" side only comes across as cringey to me, plus as much as they try to make her a multi-dimensional character, she remains very plain throughout the story.The production quality always looked immaculate, I was just nervous that they would mess up the narrative, and my concerns only got bigger when we found out that the show was going to be canon to the games. The casting is well done and plenty of the characters, just like the sets in the show, ooze that good old fallout feel; the visuals are the stars of the show for me, It just looks completely immersive and top-notch, they have so many tiny details right, it's unbelievable at times that such care was put into it and, once again, it is, by far, the best aspect of the show.Naturally, the show can't put every single great thing about Fallout in one season but it does a decent enough job and treats the source material with utmost respect while telling its own story in this universe. Once again, I just wish they didn't mishandle what they did, as these are some of the most essential aspects of the games. This show has plenty of potential, so, I hope this keeps improving as we get more and more seasons.Furthermore, the story has some clear pacing issues, and the characters aren't that great either, but it all ends very fittingly and if they can straighten these few sore bumps then we might have an incredible show on our hands by season 2. How it all comes together in the end is quite well done, I wish it happened sooner though, as for most of the show there is no captivating main driving force, the initial ones only work for the first 4 episodes. The writers could've just had Lucy meet some more intriguing characters throughout her journey this could've fleshed out her character far more and kept the overall show far more engaging than it is.Moreover, I believe people will like all three leads, Lucy is a good character who serves as a decent character for the slow introduction of the series to those who have never touched a Fallout game. The Ghoul, Cooper Howard, is a very morally corrupt character who leads most of the action sequences of the show. The Brotherhood newbie, Maximus is also a very likable addition; weirdly enough, to me, he comes across as Finn from Star Wars but is better written. This will bring in so many new fans and I am very much looking forward to their impressions on the games."	someone spend countless hour across fallout game nervous announce project videogame adaptation tend extremely disrespectful source material try thing almost time turn worse thankful fallout show carefully craft original narrative proper admiration source material canon hurt overall lore depend much like stuff poorly handle might loathe show show open cooper howard one short scene do right bomb fall destroy world effective scene get invest early right short scene introduce lucy nod skill series bite show different vault dweller interact disclose much interaction show different resident every vault another thing nicely adapt game find marriage subplot open bite cringe worthy taste hey something feel straight fallout lastly introduce brotherhood character show maximus really good job well think fan fallout would really dig lucy lead find good romantic side come across cringey plus much try make multi dimensional character remain plain throughout story production quality always look immaculate nervous would mess narrative concern get big find show go canon game cast well do plenty character like set show ooze good old fallout feel visual star show look completely immersive top notch many tiny detail right unbelievable time care put far good aspect show naturally show put every single great thing fallout one season decent enough job treat source material utmost respect tell story universe wish mishandle essential aspect game show plenty potential hope keep improve get season furthermore story clear pace issue character great either end fittingly straighten sore bump might incredible show hand season come together end quite well do wish happen soon though show captivate main drive force initial one work first episode writer could lucy meet intrigue character throughout journey could flesh character far keep overall show far engage moreover believe people like three lead lucy good character serve decent character slow introduction series never touch fallout game ghoul cooper howard morally corrupt character lead action sequence show brotherhood newbie maximus also likable addition weirdly enough come across finn star war well write bring many new fan much look forward impression game
2	This was the most intriguing tv series for 2024! Didn't watch original one or read book but can say it depicts the discipline/bushido code accurately . The natural disaster like earthquake has been shown too . Was fan of GOT for political tension , trickery but Shogun is going to replacing that since it looks real and some of the plots matches with history. Hiroyuki Sanada is excellent as usual like he performed in Westworld .And Cosmo Jarvis gets my attention , I am going to watch his other works too. Anna Sawai is delivering very good acting . Thank you Team Shogun for excellent entertainment!	intrigue tv series watch original one read book say depict discipline bushido code accurately natural disaster like earthquake show fan get political tension trickery shogun go replace since look real plot match history hiroyuki sanada excellent usual like perform westworld cosmo jarvis get attention go watch work anna sawai deliver good act thank team shogun excellent entertainment
2	It's hard to think of many TV miniseries that are as accomplished and skilfully executed as Ripley. The pleasures in watching this were so intense we watched the first six hours back to back and would have kept going if the hour hadn't been so late.The first thing to strike the viewer is the exceptional cinematography and lighting, that equal the work of Sven Nykvist and similar masters. The choice of black and white prevents the Italian seaside locales from evoking holiday memories and instead underscore the menace and threat that ripple through proceedings like a deadly undercurrent. As the frailties of the human protagonists become ever more exposed, the mute faces of classical sculptures look on with icy detachment. Shadows recur against walls in finest film noir style, while endless staircases snake across the screen like the complicated web of lies issuing from the resourceful but pitiless Ripley.And speaking of the man himself, Andrew Scott inhabits the character so effortlessly and convincingly that one forgets this is a performance; Scott IS Ripley. Every facial expression, gesture and line of dialogue is delivered with absolute perfection, showing both the emotional intelligence and psychological insight that Scott brings to the roleThe only reservation I have about the film centers on unconvincing plot points that can most likely be laid at the feet of the source material. A sampling:1. A sophisticated con artist like Ripley is unlikely to think that the rich and entitled Dickie Greenleaf would look favourably on the opportunity to smuggle a suitcase of contraband for a local Mafioso;2. It strains credibility that after Ripley reveals himself to be a manipulative and shady character, Dickie would turn down Ripley's offer to move out of Dickie's villa fairly early in the proceedings. Why on earth would Dickie want this interloper of dubious morality to stay?3. When Marge calls Rome to speak to Dickey after Dickey has disappeared, Ripley passes himself off as Dickie on the phone, even though he speaks in his normal speaking voice, which sounds nothing like Dickie;4. It seems unlikely that with the numerous letters Ripley writes to Marge and Dickie's parents pretending to be Dickie, no one notices any difference in the writing style or vocabulary used that would sound unnatural or different from Dickie's normal way of expressing himself.There are a few other similar issues with the plotting, but despite these lapses, one's enjoyment of the series is barely dented. For anyone who appreciates film noir, top flight acting or brilliant cinematography, Ripley is truly must-see viewing.	hard think many tv miniserie accomplish skilfully execute ripley pleasure watch intense watch first six hour back back would keep go hour late first thing strike viewer exceptional cinematography light equal work sven nykvist similar master choice black white prevent italian seaside locale evoke holiday memory instead underscore menace threat ripple proceed like deadly undercurrent frailty human protagonist become ever expose mute face classical sculpture look icy detachment shadow recur wall fine film noir style endless staircase snake across screen like complicate web lie issue resourceful pitiless ripley speak man andrew scott inhabit character effortlessly convincingly one forget performance scott ripley every facial expression gesture line dialogue deliver absolute perfection show emotional intelligence psychological insight scott bring rolethe reservation film center unconvincing plot point likely lie foot source material sample sophisticate con artist like ripley unlikely think rich entitle dickie greenleaf would look favourably opportunity smuggle suitcase contraband local mafioso strain credibility ripley reveal manipulative shady character dickie would turn ripley offer move dickie villa fairly early proceed earth would dickie want interloper dubious morality stay marge call rome speak dickey dickey disappear ripley pass dickie phone even though speak normal speak voice sound nothing like dickie seem unlikely numerous letter ripley write marge dickie parent pretend dickie one notice difference write style vocabulary use would sound unnatural different dickie normal way express similar issue plot despite lapse one enjoyment series barely dent anyone appreciate film noir top flight act brilliant cinematography ripley truly must see view
1	I love Nathan Fillion, and this show did not disappoint. Until the Bailey character was introduced. Dewan is awful, the character is unprofessional and incompetent. And the relationship between Nolan and Bailey comes off as forced and fake. It's almost unwatchable now.Aside from Dewan, the cast is great. Grey is my favourite, a well rounded character. Bradford, Lopez and even Harper, are all fun to watch. The introduction of Aaron was a great boost. Nolan's rookie, Celina, doesn't add much to the show.Hopefully they can get the show back on track in season 6, bring it back to what it was in the first 3 seasons. Fingers crossed.	love nathan fillion show disappoint bailey character introduce dewan awful character unprofessional incompetent relationship nolan bailey come force fake almost unwatchable aside dewan cast great grey favourite well round character bradford lopez even harper fun watch introduction aaron great boost nolan rookie celina add much show hopefully get show back track season bring back first season finger cross
2	The story was quite well known but I was really got shocked by the first 5 mins in the 1st episode. It really showed how people were cold blood in the culture revolution between 1960s and 1970s. I used to watch a lot of movie about that period but none of them could show the badness of these leaders and the madness of the majority people.Moreover, the way of presenting the game about resolving 3 body world's issue is very cool and clear. It was hard for me to understand it when I read the book. Even I understood it later, I did not think it could be presented as much fun as this tv show doing.It is really worth to watch. Great work.	story quite well know really get shock first min st episode really show people cold blood culture revolution use watch lot movie period none could show badness leader madness majority people moreover way present game resolve body world issue cool clear hard understand read book even understand later think could present much fun tv show really worth watch great work
2	"At the beginning, I didn't want to watch this show. I thought it was a second ""ER"" and was not so original. But an evening I had time and I said to myself ""Why not watching ""Grey's Anatomy"" just to see how it is ?"". So I watched it and... I liked it !Actually, it's not a remake of ""ER"". I don't really know how to explain that but it's very different from the successful show of 1994 (that I like very much too). Each character is very endearing, especially George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). And Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is so beautiful, her smile is so lovely... They aren't heroes but just people like you and me who try to be surgeons and to have a good personal life. And it's not always easy...This series is at the same time funny, sad, moving and thrilling. So, a great one !"	begin want watch show think second er original even time say watch grey anatomy see watch like actually remake er really know explain different successful show like much character endear especially george malley r knight izzie stevens katherine heigl beautiful smile lovely hero people like try surgeon good personal life always easy series time funny sad move thrill great one

It's a poor attempt at warming peoples perception of the LAPD, and they won't hesitate to make some BS political points from time to time.From the gun buyback programs that are executed like a commercial for Best Buy customer service, to the govt. subsidies available for struggling black mothers that every beat cop knows all about and is willing to help.This show is garbage."	ever someone act dramatic situation require try emphasize self impose seriousness example director beat cop someone break law tell okay cop bad also wrong everyone like director perfect show try gritty serious gunfight drug use basically gray anatomy badge poor attempt warm people perception lapd hesitate make bs political point time time gun buyback program execute like commercial good buy customer service govt subsidy available struggle black mother every beat cop know will help show garbage
1	Seasons 1-6 are the most phenomenal television I have ever seen, and I will continue to say this is my favorite show. The cast, cinematography, and writing (to be continued) is incredible. These factors leave you greatly invested in the storyline so much that the last two seasons are really a knife to the heart. So much beautiful set up is betrayed by sloppy writing, rushed plots, and corny outcomes: things you would never expect to see in a show of this impecability. However, with the absolute trash writing that comes with season 7 and 8, the cast never loses their touch. One can truly see what a talented bunch of actors are present in this show when they must completely switch their characters without much room for transition. With the boring dialogue and cheesy scenes, these actors maintain their dignity and great work. This show was always ten stars for me but this final season, especially, led me to remove 4 stars and that is being extremely generous. It feels as if all this investment, all the prophecies, all the preparation present in this show was wasted on that ending. The final episode tried so hard to create a twist that it made little sense and tied no loose ends. The only character development and storyline that followed through was Sansa's and that is probably the only part of this season that kept me watching. Very disappointed in how the writers spent so much time delivering a perfect nearly complete gift only to put a silly little bow on top of it before it was even packaged properly.	season phenomenal television ever see continue say favorite show cast cinematography write continue incredible factor leave greatly invest storyline much last two season really knife heart much beautiful set betray sloppy write rush plot corny outcome thing would never expect see show impecability however absolute trash write come season cast never lose touch one truly see talented bunch actor present show must completely switch character without much room transition bore dialogue cheesy scene actor maintain dignity great work show always ten star final season especially lead remove star extremely generous feel investment prophecy preparation present show waste end final episode try hard create twist make little sense tie loose end character development storyline follow sansa probably part season keep watch disappoint writer spend much time deliver perfect nearly complete gift put silly little bow top even package properly
2	If you haven't already. Watch the first episode. The production value alone will get you hooked.So many stories to follow. So many characters to love and to hate and to root for or boo at.It's been a while since I've watched something from the fresh start of its inception, and had to wait a week for the next episode. The wait is always worth it. Its shocking, its funny, it's sad and courageous. The team of writers are on point at keeping you guessing what's going to happen!? Who is that!? What are they going to do!?The cinematography and sets/visuals are beautifully stunning. They have captured a real and wild Japan both in the cities and the countryside, the towns, the buildings, the savagery and the beauty. At times it can be brutally harsh then in an instant vulnerable and soft.If you don't like subtitles at least give it a try. Mainly spoken of Japanese, there are moments of English, though in reality they are supposed to be speaking Portuguese.Disney. You've finally done something good. But I think it was actually FX.	already watch first episode production value alone get hook many story follow many character love hate root boo since watch something fresh start inception wait week next episode wait always worth shock funny sad courageous team writer point keep guess go happen go cinematography set visual beautifully stun capture real wild japan cities countryside town build savagery beauty time brutally harsh instant vulnerable soft like subtitle least give try mainly speak japanese moment english though reality suppose speak portuguese disney finally do something good think actually fx

Viewers who like robot-ey things and senseless violence. Im not offended or grossed out, its just all kind of silly.This reminded me alot of 1995's Tank Girl, but longer, slower, and more dramatic. None in a good way (not saying that Lori Petty movie was great, but it was quick and fun for what it was) This is not a good show. It jumps around between groups, environments, slowly tries to bring in a plot....maybe. The underground, bunkered people are afraid to go to the surface...where people seem to be living just fine? Huh?I guess its just not interesting enough for me to continue past the first couple of episodes.2 stars instead of 1 for the cool sci-fi angle.	disclosure know nothing game care game watch clue expectation obviously teen gamer viewer like robot ey thing senseless violence I m offend gross kind silly remind alot tank girl long slow dramatic none good way say lori petty movie great quick fun good show jump around group environment slowly try bring plot maybe underground bunker people afraid go surface people seem live fine huh guess interest enough continue past first couple episode star instead cool sci fi angle
2	Ok, let me be clear: I'm not comparing actors, cinematography, script etc. That would be impossible and foolish. But when it comes to the overall impression, evaluation, feeling that I was left with after watching Ripley, I can subjectively say that only 'Dexter' is in the same league.Words that pop into mind include art, pure, contrast, smile, dark, sophistication, psychology, perspective, tension, romance, charm, obsession, beauty, captivating, to name but a few.So over the years this is only the second time I've experienced this. I hope there will be a third. When it happens, I'll let you know.	ok let clear compare actor cinematography script etc would impossible foolish come overall impression evaluation feel leave watch ripley subjectively say dexter league word pop mind include art pure contrast smile dark sophistication psychology perspective tension romance charm obsession beauty captivate name year second time experience hope third happen let know
0	I was looking forward to this show since it came out and all was well, I was enjoying it, but when I watched episode 6... Todd Howard has used his connections to basically do the adult version of destroying a lego set because he didn't get to be the one to build it. If you're a fan of 1, 2, or New Vegas do not watch this show because they will piss on you and not even have the grace to call it rain. They destroyed the NCR, in fact, making it so the NCR was destroyed PRE New Vegas, therefore nullifying it. This is such an adult temper tantrum. This was made out of anger and spite that Obsidian made a better game and it shows.Good actors though. Sorry that good acting can't save bad writing.	look forward show since come well enjoy watch episode todd howard use connection basically adult version destroy lego set get one build fan new vegas watch show piss even grace call rain destroy ncr fact make ncr destroy pre new vegas therefore nullify adult temper tantrum make anger spite obsidian make well game show good actor though sorry good act save bad write

2	"Before you write this off as some hater, know that I'm a person of color. I appreciate the attempt at bringing real life issues into the show, but that does not forgive bad writing or a shove-it-down-your-throat attitude. Season 3 has so far been only about 2 things. Women suffering from men and people of color suffering from bad cops. There's no longer policing, there's no longer ""The Rookie"". This is another show, and it's the wrong show.This used to be a goody-two-shoes comic relief police show with just enough drama to make us invested. That doesn't go with this. If you want to talk about these issues that deeply then make another show dedicated to them.And if you wanted to simply give them an appearance in ""The Rookie"", then you could have done it more subtly and without simply pulling us out of the story and environment we were used to. For example, Officer Smitty would have been a good character to involve in the racism issues. He's a slacker, comic-relief, but what if we show him when he feels endangered, because of a person of color who doesn't show any cause for danger? That could have been a good tip of the hat towards the issue, and showing it through a character we're familiar with.One other thing is the death of logic in this third season.SPOILERS IN THE NEXT LINE. (Check below for Spoiler end and start reading there to avoid season 3 spoilers)The fact that Jackson's TO would be this stupid when he has the IA commander's son as a boot just doesn't make sense. And if he's as smart and cautious about his racism as they make him out to be, he'd have actually acted like a goody-two-shoes in front of Jackson, which the latter could have noticed and created another plotline about that, but we're past that now.SPOILER END.At the moment, I'm conflicted about even finish season 3, I'm at episode 5, and frankly I don't want to watch it.

1	A good show - good casting, good acting, nice decors, but very, very rushed. In just 4 episodes they cover half of the books, and don't really show how the main character experiences the cultural shock and how he comes to change his views of Japan's culture, and how he comes to understand and accept the culture and customs, it's people and how he adapts to his new life in Japan.If you haven't read the books, you'll probably be thrilled by the show. But if you have read the books - you might be disappointed by how rushed it is the show.I'm giving it a 7.5 (though I'm rounding it down to compensate for all the 10 - who are exaggerated).	good show good cast good act nice decor rush episode cover half book really show main character experience cultural shock come change view japan culture come understand accept culture custom people adapt new life japan read book probably thrill show read book might disappoint rush show give though round compensate exaggerate

Too many flashbacks, flash forwards, flash sideways. These were used as time fillers which served no purpose.Minimal exposition would have served just as well. Characters, let's do this, let's do that. No denied, no can't do that, do this instead because plot says so. And let's talk about it for several episodes. This rambling is similar to the dialog. Let's do this because of that and then watch what happens because that's what is suppose to happen.	start potential first episode show promise quickly devolve mid evil soap opera portrayel character beyond antiseptic many flashback flash forward flash sideways use time filler serve purpose minimal exposition would serve well character let let deny instead plot say let talk several episode ramble similar dialog let watch happen suppose happen

EVERYTHING has been great about this show except for the terrible final season. Its nobody's fault but the writers: they underestimated the intelligence of the viewers in a way that's simply insulting and they clearly just wanted to end what should have been an epic tale. What was the point of watching the previous 7 seasons if this is where it leads? Don't waste your time.	show start strong final season happen writer clearly idea character lore show everything great show except terrible final season nobody fault writer underestimate intelligence viewer way simply insult clearly want end epic tale point watch previous season lead waste time

0	Grey's Anatomy is a mediocre show. No single aspect of it is notably terrible, but nothing is notably amazing either. The acting is generally tolerable, sometimes even good, and cinematography is serviceable considering the time period of initial seasons, but that's where the positives end. Most characters feel very shallowly developed. Dialogue often feels too artificial. The longer term story is all over the place, with characters making arbitrary choices not suiting their personality simply to stir up drama when the show gets slow. I can safely say after watching 6 seasons and reading the abysmal reviews of newer ones, it's not worth watching besides as background noise.	grey anatomy mediocre show single aspect notably terrible nothing notably amaze either act generally tolerable sometimes even good cinematography serviceable consider time period initial season positive end character feel shallowly develop dialogue often feel artificial long term story place character make arbitrary choice suit personality simply stir drama show get slow safely say watch season read abysmal review new one worth watch besides background noise
0	I have never played the game, and so come to it with no expectations, but reviewing this as a stand-alone show I am quite unimpressed. The story is a pretty run of the mill post nuclear apocalypse yarn about feral humans trapped on the surface and privileged people dwelling in underground bunkers until things go wrong and they are forced to interact.The storyline is silly, some of the scenes comedic for no discernible reason, the pacing is dreadfully slow and the characters unengaging. Two episodes in I simply find myself uninterested in continuing to be bored by this.Perhaps, were I an aficionado of the game, I would enjoy it more and be looking forward to future storylines but I'm not, so I can't, and the production does not have enough going for it to make me continue with it.	never play game come expectation review stand alone show quite unimpressed story pretty run mill post nuclear apocalypse yarn feral humans trap surface privilege people dwell underground bunker thing go wrong force interact storyline silly scene comedic discernible reason pace dreadfully slow character unengage two episode simply find uninterested continue bore perhaps aficionado game would enjoy look forward future storyline production enough go make continue
2	What a terrific adaptation this is. Classic anti- hero Tom Ripley, the creation of author Patricia Highsmith, is a survivor, a conman and sociopath.Brilliantly played by Andrew Scott, who exudes a quiet menace, with a minimum amount of effort.Tom's small cons in New York aren't going well, so he descides to take a commission to go to Italy, to persuade Dickie Greenleaf a casual acquaintance to come back to his family in America. As soon as he arrives, he see's an opportunity to live comfortably at Dickie's expense, much to the consternation of his girlfriend Marge, Dakota Fanning.

0	With the acting as flat like this I could hardly believe this was created by the same people that created Game of Thrones.. Was it really?I can see why people that read the book say it's far more better than the series. I guess it should be.I watched this series with some enjoyment, but it did not encourage me to go read the book.That was in fact all I wanted to say about 3 Body Problem... but I still need 186 characters.... Well then... if I must... I think this is a mediocre SF series, with a lot of plotholes and characters that do not really come to life. Something to watch if you cannot find anything else to watch.	act flat like could hardly believe create people create game throne really see people read book say far well series guess watch series enjoyment encourage go read book fact want say body problem still need character well must think mediocre sf series lot plothole character really come life something watch find anything else watch

2	I was sceptical at first but I really enjoyed this TV show. Black/white footage and italian language make it pleasant to watch. Even though there might only be two very tense scenes I never felt bored while watching. The only thing that bothers me is that Marge seems to be a bit dumb: When Tom introduces himself to her very early in the show, he mentions that his parents drowned in a boating accident. But when he talks to her in the last episode he mentions that they died in a car accident. She should have instantly realized that he is a liar and not to be trusted. Other than this I really enjoyed the show! 9/10.	sceptical first really enjoy tv show black white footage italian language make pleasant watch even though might two tense scene never feel bore watch thing bother marge seem bite dumb tom introduce early show mention parent drown boat accident talk last episode mention die car accident instantly realize liar trust really enjoy show
2	I enjoyed my time with the series. It's not as complex as the books (and the science is very shallow in comparison) but it's not nearly as bad as some have made it out to be.Bernard Wong is a great Da Shi, Liam Cunningham inhabits Wade well, and, knowing where their story goes, I did enjoy the relationship between Jin and Will. The other characters are all fair enough versions or amalgamations of various ones in the books, but I have to admit that I simply didn't like the Auggie character at all - her constant moping and nae-saying brought little to the table and I ended up just finding her annoying.I'll stick with the series (if Netflix does!), and look forward to seeing how they handle the vast change in scope as the story progresses.Overall things are off to a good start - it could go either way, but it's a long way from the 1/10 that some of the more reactionary reviewers have judged it!	enjoy time series complex book science shallow comparison nearly bad make bernard wong great da shi liam cunningham inhabit wade well know story go enjoy relationship jin character fair enough version amalgamation various one book admit simply like auggie character constant mop nae say bring little table end find annoy stick series netflix look forward see handle vast change scope story progress overall thing good start could go either way long way reactionary reviewer judge

0	The series starts with a impactful scene from the Chinese cultural revolution where people are murdered for believing in science and the truth, and not complying with their social revolution.Almost unbelievably, Netflix then switches to a scene where they show how they, themselves, are perpetrating the modern version of this.Within the first couple of minutes you'll meet the genius leading black character working overtime and the two genius female leads, one Asian and one gorgeous white woman. All the classics. Then add the white male doofus trying to talk to them but who is of course rejected, looked down upon and is just pathetic. This story unfortunately just continues.A society based not on the truth, not on the scientific method, but their misled, brainwashed beliefs, is a society that is destined to implode. The irony stinks, but the fact that people don't even see it, is dangerous.	series start impactful scene chinese cultural revolution people murder believe science truth comply social revolution almost unbelievably netflix switch scene show perpetrate modern version within first couple minute meet genius lead black character work overtime two genius female lead one asian one gorgeous white woman classic add white male doofus try talk course reject look upon pathetic story unfortunately continue society base truth scientific method mislead brainwash beliefs society destine implode irony stink fact people even see dangerous

Don't waste my time.They add the odd bit of ultra violence for dramatic effect but it fails for deliver. The characters are non relatable and I care for non of them. Loads of critical stuff not explained and incoherent. Stick to the games as this adaptation is a waste of time to watch.Got to episode 3 and gave up as it was painful to watch. Some weird 200 year old zombie with no nose who doesn't seem to get hurt. Crappy metal space marines who are dicks. Some innocent girl who's lived in a tin for her life who suddenly is Bear Grylls.

1	"I share the notion with some other reviews, that this show is a bit uneven. I have not read the book, but the 1st episode hooked me good. Good pacing, good mystery, good science-fiction, feeling of something big and important going on. Just perfect. But soon other aspects of the show started appearing, and it became... Not bad, but probably not as good.It, actually, kind of reminds me of Dune, and what made Dune so difficult to adapt to screen, with politics being the main problem. There are quite a lot of politics here. They do make total sense in the context of the show, especially as more information is revealed later on, but they can still be a bit boring. And sometimes on the nose.Another problem is that I just don't believe these characters are scientists. Especially, when a cult comes into play (let me phrase it this way to avoid spoilers). I may entertain the idea, that they are smart, but that they are scientists? I don't know, they do not match the pattern that I've seen among a few real scientists, that I've known during my higher education. In fact, I would say that it is difficult for me to buy whatever occupation is for most of the characters in the show, besides, maybe the teacher guy. They do not feel ""human"" enough, I guess.Nevertheless, this was overall a good watch for me. Can't say I will recommend it to everyone, but I can definitely recommend trying it, while keeping in mind, that this is partially like a prologue, based on certain things happening in the end. I expect, that things can get closer to what was happening during 1st episode."	share notion review show bite uneven read book st episode hook good good pace good mystery good science fiction feel something big important go perfect soon aspect show start appear become bad probably good actually kind remind dune make dune difficult adapt screen politic main problem quite lot politic make total sense context show especially information reveal later still bite bore sometimes nose another problem believe character scientist especially cult come play let phrase way avoid spoiler may entertain idea smart scientist know match pattern see among real scientist know high education fact would say difficult buy whatever occupation character show besides maybe teacher guy feel human enough guess nevertheless overall good watch say recommend everyone definitely recommend try keep mind partially like prologue base certain thing happen end expect thing get close happen st episode
1	The plot is really good, the first 3 episodes very good and very accurate. Great series....but, where is the Portuguese language?The japanese people speaks their own language but when a Portuguese translator is needed the characters speaks in English.The directors should be more careful with this, and this issue is enough to put me off with the series and downgrade this much my rate instead of a 10 if they speak the correct language, it's really annoying specially for a Portuguese speaker waiting for my own language and then...english. Really disappointed.If there will be second season the producers should rethink about this.	plot really good first episode good accurate great series portuguese language japanese people speak language portuguese translator need character speak english director careful issue enough put series downgrade much rate instead speak correct language really annoy specially portuguese speaker wait language english really disappoint second season producer rethink

2	"Within the first episode you can tell the quality of the production is excellent. Incredible sets and props combine with a well written story line, supported by a very talented cast, for a visual feast that does not fail to entertain. Ella Purnell is perfectly cast as 'Lucy' and brings a solid performance to the role. Walter Goggins is a gifted actor and fulfills the role of 'The Ghoul' with his own personal flair. The supporting cast has a wide scope of talent with a long list of quality credits to their names.Overall, I found this to be a show that is well written, well produced, and well cast. It stands in a class with series like ""See"", ""Silo"", ""Into the Badlands"" and ""The Last of Us"".Even if this genre isn't typically on your list, I highly recommend giving 'Fallout' a view.

0	Watching the first few episodes I had hopes of this being a worthwhile series to watch. Ultimately, I found this to be comparable to the route Game of Thrones took, excellent to start with and then falls apart at the end.Instead of continuing with the exciting story line laid out in the beginning it diverted off into seeming like it was trying to do over the top character development with only a few episodes left. That got me to wondering how are they going to finish this story with all the digging into characters lives that was going on.The final few episodes were soft and disappointing... to the point that I felt like I had wasted my time.	watch first episode hop worthwhile series watch ultimately find comparable route game throne take excellent start fall apart end instead continue excite story line lie begin divert seem like try top character development episode leave get wonder go finish story dig character live go final episode soft disappoint point feel like waste time

As long as you know the show/story will fall off a cliff and change completely once the book material runs out, you will have a great viewing, if you are expecting the same quality start to finish, you will be angry/upset/disappointed.The dialogue, writing, plot points, pacing, character assassinations/dumbed down, plot armour, no more strategic politics, everything really just becomes dumbed down once the producers take over. Up until that, it's like a more mature, well-written, twisted dark medieval show with a bit of fantasy.	season season season season season season season season show clearly fall quality soon run book season almost direct adaptation book season bite mix book material end season write producer fantastic show multiple plot storyline get draw least character want see happen long know show story fall cliff change completely book material run great view expect quality start finish angry upset disappoint dialogue write plot point pace character assassination dumbe plot armour strategic politic everything really become dumbe producer take like mature well write twist dark medieval show bite fantasy
2	"To get the obvious thing out of the way first, the casting makes no sense. I spent the first few episodes trying to work out if Tom and Dickie are meant to be 40-somethings in this version, with Dickie having a much younger girlfriend, or whether the viewer is supposed to accept that these 40-something actors are in their mid-20s. The answer? They're meant to be ""30s"" someone eventually says. And Freddie Miles is played by a female non-binary actor, which means that he reads half the time as a woman and the other half as a 15-year-old boy.But... once you get over that, this is very enjoyable! It's so beautifully shot, in an expressionist style, that it makes you aware of how by-numbers the blocking and camera angles are in most modern dramas. Andrew Scott is mesmerising, of course (although, since he plays Tom as a really creepy, reptilian weirdo, it's hard to understand why Dickie becomes his friend). The use of music, sound effects and silence really heightened the atmosphere. The 'will they catch him or won't they' ramps up until it gets properly tense. The inspector is brilliant.I enjoyed this series more with each episode, and found myself wishing there were more episodes to watch. I would like to see a similar adaptation of other books in the series - with Andrew Scott, but perhaps with slightly less weird casting otherwise."	get obvious thing way first cast make sense spend first episode try work tom dickie mean something version dickie much young girlfriend whether view suppose accept something actor mid answer mean someone eventually say freddie mile play female non binary actor mean read half time woman half year old boy get enjoyable beautifully shoot expressionist style make aware number block camera angle modern dramas andrew scott mesmerise course although since play tom really creepy reptilian weirdo hard understand dickie become friend use music sound effect silence really heighten atmosphere catch ramp get properly tense inspector brilliant enjoy series episode find wish episode watch would like see similar adaptation book series andrew scott perhaps slightly less weird cast otherwise
0	After watching the show in its entirety and the first and second episode one more time for good measure I am certain that the show is not about fallout or its inhabitants.From the beginning, the show ignores one of the core principle of the universe: radioactivity. Radioactivity is the number one thing that the vaults are built to protect its inhabitant against (although vault tech also did some pretty nasty experiments, but this is besides the point), to the point where each and every adult vault dweller is provided with a device that constantly monitor the environment. In this show, it's merely a macguffin.The ending of the show is also a macguffin without resolution: Vault 31-33 remains under VT's control, the BoS gets control of the macguffin, the next macguffin is in NV where the Ghoul and Dog Meat are headed and Lucy tags along because she has nothing better to do.The fallout universe is merely a backdrop, that's why it's paradoxically largely ignored.	watch show entirety first second episode one time good measure certain show fallout inhabitant begin show ignore one core principle universe radioactivity radioactivity number one thing vault build protect inhabitant although vault tech also pretty nasty experiment besides point point every adult vault dweller provide device constantly monitor environment show merely macguffin end show also macguffin without resolution vault remain vt control bos get control macguffin next macguffin nv ghoul dog meat head lucy tag along nothing well fallout universe merely backdrop paradoxically largely ignore

1	This TV show hit me hard after the pilot episode. Great effects, perfect atmosphere, beautiful scenery, perfect casting on japanese's part - everything was working out. Same with the second episode, and a bit weaker with the third. And that's it. The series should have ended there, or just fricking utilize the potential it had. But it didn't. I felt tricked as the episodes went on, as they are making you to believe some perfect storm is coming to brace yourself for action. But it doesn't!!! And it makes you feel tricked. Instead, you are getting more and more inconclusive dialogue that seems to lead nowhere. And it DOES lead nowhere. Or at least they are saving the efforts for the final episode. I would like my time invested here back, thank you very much!	tv show hit hard pilot episode great effect perfect atmosphere beautiful scenery perfect cast japanese part everything work second episode bite weak third series end fricke utilize potential feel trick episode go make believe perfect storm come brace action make feel trick instead get inconclusive dialogue seem lead nowhere lead nowhere least save effort final episode would like time invest back thank much

2	The series is quite entertaining and although it has its flows I am glad that Netflix has finally released something space/apocalypse related. There is a noticable lack of those themes in the past few years and I am not sure why. Maybe CGI is too expensive?When it comes to 3 Body Problem series, the acting is good, the plot is original and the camera work is professional. 6th and 7th episode of the 1st season feel like fillers though. Even though a director or writer probably wanted them for character building, interpersonal relationships and for us to start caring more about certain characters, they could have been much shorter. They mess up with the flow and pace.Nevertheless, I am happy this series is made and I am eagerly awaiting more episodes to be released. If you are a fan of space / apocalypse themes, you should definitely watch it.	series quite entertain although flow glad netflix finally release something space apocalypse relate noticable lack theme past year sure maybe cgi expensive come body problem series act good plot original camera work professional th th episode st season feel like filler though even though director writer probably want character build interpersonal relationship we start care certain character could much short mess flow pace nevertheless happy series make eagerly await episode release fan space apocalypse theme definitely watch
2	In Episode 05, Sophon tells Wade and Jin Cheng, that San-Ti's planet is unstable so they don't have much time to improve their technology compared to Earth.That is not necessarily true because human civilization also faces the same hurdles as the San-Ti in the form of Ice Age. Holocene, the interglacial period we're in, happens to be longer than the previous ones, giving us much time to improve our technology from farming, to industrial revolution, to atomic bomb, to computer and information age.The big difference is that we achieve all that in one go, uninterrupted. So, instead of demeaning and calling us bugs, the San-Ti should worship us as gods. Flawless, but divine nonetheless.Anyways, for all of it flaws, 3 Body Problem breathes a fresh air to sci-fi genre, which for too long has defied the laws of physics -- for instance, people travelling at the speed of light don't seem to be affected by time dilation, and come back to find there loved ones the same age as when they left them (what kinda bulltit is that?).	episode sophon tell wade jin cheng san ti planet unstable much time improve technology compare earth necessarily true human civilization also face hurdle san ti form ice age holocene interglacial period happen long previous one give we much time improve technology farm industrial revolution atomic bomb computer information age big difference achieve one go uninterrupted instead demean call we bug san ti worship we god flawless divine nonetheless anyways flaw body problem breathe fresh air sci fi genre long defy law physics instance people travel speed light seem affect time dilation come back find love one age leave kinda bulltit
0	I watched the first four episodes hoping it would get better, but finally had to call it. While the cinematography was beautiful, I had a hard time feeling any pull to keep watching. The series is drab, moves at a snail's pace and did little to keep my interest as the plot lines were dragged out well beyond what was required. This should have stayed a movie as those behind the series have not found a way to create an engaging bridge between the more interesting moments of the series. It was almost as if the series flat lined for most of the air time, with a few flashes of life intended to keep viewers engaged. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough for me!	watch first four episode hop would get well finally call cinematography beautiful hard time feel pull keep watch series drab move snail pace little keep interest plot line drag well beyond require stay movie behind series find way create engage bridge interest moment series almost series flat line air time flash life intend keep viewer engage unfortunately enough
2	Let's say you're reading these reviews and haven't watched GoT yet, but now that it's finished are considering the marathon. What's the consensus? In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:Seasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.Season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.Season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.The biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.So can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not. It could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:Battlestar Galactica (2003-2008)Twin Peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)Breaking Bad	let say read review watch get yet finish consider marathon consensus case consensus accurate season outstanding deep world build intelligent dialogue epic set piece worthy hollywood expert act detail plot genuine surprise great soundtrack use sparingly get worth watch season definitely season suddenly notice write plot take sharp dive downward quality inexplicable idea inconsistent characterisation soap opera drama least entertainment value still high get pass season drop chasm depth think possible write get amateurish still fantastic production value long enough save ever enjoy lose amaze bad final season familiar territory big problem final season take us story get we think many weakness lose suspension disbelief fatal fiction also ruin series arc point rewatch entire series pointless recommend get marathon newcomer yes first season worth disappointment later good series time could drop ball final stretch put behind follow superior series worthy marathon battlestar galactica twin peak season plus movie break bad

I hoped it would change and get back to how season 1 and 3 were. It sucks now and I won't be watching it anymore. Nathan Fillion was very entertaining in Castle and I think that's what brought us all to watch The Rookie. It's very boring of late but at least I can go back and watch re-runs of Castle. What a let-down, this used to be fun to watch. It's as if we are now watching reality TV. It really ended after season 2. A lot of cop shows were cancelled due to the current political climate around policing and it feels like The Rookie only escaped its fate because they made some kind of deal to transform their entertaining little show into a platform for the issue.	watch rookie long really like castle peyton place poor relationship police show hop would change get back season suck watch anymore nathan fillion entertain castle think bring we watch rookie bore late least go back watch run castle let use fun watch watch reality tv really end season lot cop show cancel due current political climate around police feel like rookie escape fate make kind deal transform entertain little show platform issue
1	"I have been watching this since the very beginning of it. It has started amazingly and was very well paced and produced. A whole big amazing Real but Fantasy world with interesting characters all have different story lines and still connected masterfully.I have to admit that I was amazed and found myself unable to stop watching it. I wen through and were looking for any material related to it so I found the books. A song of ice and fire. what a great universe. what a magnificent writing and what a brutal yet interesting story telling. I found myself dedicated to the story and faster than any book before, I have done reading them. then again and again I re-watched the show and tried to dig down the theories, prophecies, build ups and characters arcs. What a great journey! I have to admit that it was great. Reading about the blue rose in the wall and finding the true meaning beyond the ice and fire was especially a magnificent experience. Thanks a lot both for the creator of the show and The author George Raymond Richard Martin.That was the first part, until The books stopped because for any reason the author didn't finished them and the end of season 4 on the TV and some parts of the rest until the end of season 6. beyond that, the show has started to fall down and got worse and worse through time. no complex story line links, no character development, no mind-blowing twists, no deep dialogues and finally it converted to a whole new thing. something that was not like what I have loved once. It became a disaster in season 8 in fact. what an unfortunate, what a waste.I gave the show 10/10 stars and despite some bad writings and bad episodes haven't had a second thought about changing it ever before until now. It is with great sorrow only now where I am going to change my vote for the whole TV Show and give it a fair one considering season 7 and season 8. and considering that, it is definitely way lower than a 10/10. this is a beater end for me and Game of thrones. I wont watch it again because it is both ridiculous and painful (for example anytime someone says ""winter is coming"") and I wont be reading the books neither because Ive been informed that Author has been saying :the shows path is not much difference from the books"". Also I wont be watching anything relating to this universe ever unless I hear otherwise about the way the books will handle the story.So If you haven't watched this show yet, be careful to not get involved very deep and not be deceived by the greatness of first 4 chapters or you will be disappointed in the most horrible way possible."	watch since begin start amazingly well pace produce whole big amaze real fantasy world interest character different story line still connect masterfully admit amaze find unable stop watch wen look material relate find book song ice fire great universe magnificent write brutal yet interest story tell find dedicate story fast book do read watch show try dig theory prophecy build up character arc great journey admit great read blue rise wall find true mean beyond ice fire especially magnificent experience thank lot creator show author george raymond richard martin first part book stop reason author finish end season tv part rest end season beyond show start fall get worse bad time complex story line link character development mind blow twist deep dialogue finally convert whole new thing something like love become disaster season fact unfortunate waste give show star despite bad write bad episode second think change ever great sorrow go change vote whole tv show give fair one consider season season consider definitely way low beater end game throne will not watch ridiculous painful example anytime someone say winter come will not read book neither I ve inform author say show path much difference book also will not watch anything relate universe ever unless hear otherwise way book handle story watch show yet careful get involve deep deceive greatness first chapter disappoint horrible way possible

The first time it happened I thought maybe some car arrived on the scene with the stereo blasting. They need to either tone it way down or find a music director who knows how to place better music in scenes.As for the action and writing. The ""Rookie"" himself is often a bit of a ""Dudley Do-Right"" who always does the right thing no matter what. I'm not too sure just how realistic that is, but we need to see some in law enforcement on tv who aren't willing to bend or break the rules just to get their case solved like we see so often in other police shows. The story lines are usually pretty good too with the primary characters being far deeper than the two dimensional characters we see on a lot of cop shows.

2	Started this and thought it was a nice light thing to watch, especially judging by the trailer and the beginning of the first episode. It was pretty funny, very well shot, acting is great. Binged a few episodes and it seemed to get darker and darker until half way through the season and holy hell, that went a whole different way.

She would not have burned the town. Aria was the master killer. She was supposed to kill beautifully at the end. It seems like all your viewers that hate the ending knew the characters better than you and could have written the end to a masterpiece now ruined Probably by some selfish multi millionaire ego(s).

I'm a doctor and considering medically it showcased patient emotions and interactions quite well but eventually story gets messy and it's related always something personal with the characters.

1	Watched first 2 episodes of Ripley on Netflix. I was first impressed by the pristine black n white cinematography and production design depicting NYC in the '60s. At the end of episode 2, I lost interest.Talented Mr. Ripley written by Patricia Highsmith was published in the mid '50s.The book was first made by Rene Clement into Purple Noon starring Alain Delon and Maurice Ronet which remains a classic.Theatre 2nd adaptation was by Anthony Minghella in 1999 staring Matt Damon as Ripley and Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf.It was well made and entertaining.Ripley the new mini series was created, written and directed by the prolific film/TV series writer/director Steven Zaillian.Theatre reviews are mixed. Some complained its 'glacial' plot development.It is possible that the book might not have enough content to fill an 8 episode mini series.That being said, the problem with this Ripley is the casting. Firstly, both actors for Ripley and Dickie are too old for their roles. They supposed to be in the mid-20's while Andrew Scott and Johnny Flynn are weathered looking in their mid to late 30's.As Ripley, Andrew Scott is a good actor who first appeared as Moriaty in Sherlock the TV series, but he lacks dual charisma as the innocent looking Ripley but a cold, cunning psychopath in reality. Johnny Flynn the British actor looks nothing like a care free rich boy who supposed to be the idol of Ripley for his wealth and sex appeal. The actor has a bit speech impediment, bloated face and looking much uncomfortable in his role. Dakota Fanning as Dickie friend Marge who's supposed to have an on n off again relationship with Dickie also looked ill fitting and too old.Talented Mr. Ripley the book has a major flaw. After the demise of Dickie, Ripley went around Italy impersonating Dickie and siphoning off his money. He might get by in Italy in the early '50s but readers might wonder unless these 2 characters have resemblance. Maybe that's why Hitchcock filmed Stranger on the Train instead.Another oddity of Ripley is the casting of a woman Eliot Sumner as Freddie Miles who was played by Philip Seymour Hoffman in the earlier version. This time Ripley dragged his feet down the stairs with his head banging on the steps. I don't remember how Matt Damon did in The Talented Mr. Ripley.The series was filmed in beautiful locales in the isle of Capri standing in for Atrani.	watch first episode ripley netflix first impress pristine black n white cinematography production design depict nyc end episode lose interest talente mr ripley write patricia highsmith publish mid book first make rene clement purple noon star alain delon maurice ronet remain classic theatre nd adaptation anthony minghella star matt damon ripley jude law dickie greenleaf well make entertain ripley new mini series create write direct prolific film tv series writer director steven zaillian theatre review mix complain glacial plot development possible book might enough content fill episode mini series say problem ripley cast firstly actors ripley dickie old role suppose mid andrew scott johnny flynn weather look mid late ripley andrew scott good actor first appear moriaty sherlock tv series lack dual charisma innocent look ripley cold cunning psychopath reality johnny flynn british actor look nothing like care free rich boy suppose idol ripley wealth sex appeal actor bite speech impediment bloat face look much uncomfortable role dakota fan dickie friend marge suppose n relationship dickie also look ill fit old talented mr ripley book major flaw demise dickie ripley go around italy impersonate dickie siphon money might get italy early reader might wonder unless character resemblance maybe hitchcock film stranger train instead another oddity ripley cast woman eliot sumner freddie miles play philip seymour hoffman early version time ripley drag foot stairs head bang step remember matt damon talente mr ripley series film beautiful locale isle capri stand atrani
2	This show although at first glance seems boring, developes to one of the most thrilling series I've ever seen everything from the acting and storytelling was extremely well done. The only negatives portrayed by the show is its stretched out and unnatural scenes that in one scene can be breathtaking but in the other a overdramatic unrealistic mess. Although it states it's based on a true story that is far from the case, while the idea is; the story is not. Either way this show is definitely worth watching and anyone who enjoys dark shows with in-depth storytelling will find baby reindeer a thrilling end enjoyable show.	show although first glance seem bore develop one thrill series ever see everything act storytelle extremely well do negative portray show stretch unnatural scene one scene breathtake overdramatic unrealistic mess although state base true story far case idea story either way show definitely worth watch anyone enjoy dark show depth storytelling find baby reindeer thrill end enjoyable show
1	Available on Hulu and FX, Shogun is an American production co-created by husband-and-wife duo Justin Marks and Rachel Kondo. The creators proudly used Japanese as the prominently spoken language in the show to enhance authenticity and they supplemented it with English subtitles, and dubbing (available only on Hulu). While I appreciate the dedication to authenticity, it's worth noting that many English-speaking viewers, myself included, find that subtitles and dubbing hinder the enjoyment of a show.For me, enjoying a show goes beyond its visual appeal and world-building aspects, although I do enjoy those aspects as well, and 'Shogun' has that in spades. I feel that appreciating the nuances of character conversations is paramount, and that gets lost with subtitles. Similarly, no matter how good the dubbing is, it always feels awkward and disconnected, taking away from being fully enraptured with the storyline. It's regrettable really, because the production quality is undeniably remarkable and I'm sure the cast is brilliant.It can't be understated enough that my preference against subtitles and dubbing is solely based on my personal entertainment experience and is not meant to offend anyone. It's just a matter of personal enjoyment. And isn't that what a television show is supposed to be about?	available hulu fx shogun american production co create husband wife duo justin mark rachel kondo creator proudly use japanese prominently speak language show enhance authenticity supplement english subtitle dub available hulu appreciate dedication authenticity worth note many english speak viewer include find subtitle dub hinder enjoyment show enjoy show go beyond visual appeal world build aspect although enjoy aspect well shogun spade feel appreciate nuance character conversation paramount get lose subtitle similarly matter good dub always feel awkward disconnect take away fully enrapture storyline regrettable really production quality undeniably remarkable sure cast brilliant understate enough preference subtitle dub solely base personal entertainment experience mean offend anyone matter personal enjoyment television show suppose
0	Lets be honest, the concept is interesting. Unfortunately, they took this concept threw it in the trash, spit on it, and decided it was good to go. What even was the pacing? It is hard to know how much time has passed, the ending was not intriguing for another season, and not a single character was remotely likeable.I don't understand the split between the main characters and the push and pull with the plot. It would have been much better focusing on 3 of the group rather than randomly switching all focus between them and giving them predictable dialogue.Ended up having my finger on the 5 second skip button the last episode because I just wanted it to be over. So much wasted potential for a unique concept. Feels like they've bitten off more than they can chew.	let honest concept interest unfortunately take concept throw trash spit decide good go even pace hard know much time pass end intrigue another season single character remotely likeable understand split main character push pull plot would much well focus group rather randomly switch focus give predictable dialogue end finger second skip button last episode want much waste potential unique concept feel like bite chew
0	The rookie starts of quite engaging but goes to hell after the third season. At one point it is really only about pushing an agenda down the viewers throat, which is so obvious and poorly done, that it hurts during some scenes.Some of the early characters have some really complex development, but most of the newly introduced ones are shallow and cliché.The sassy FBI rookie lady in the fourth season being the pinnacle of obnoxious self entitlement, which finally made me quit the show.Furthermore the whole poshness and fancy lifestyle, which almost all of the characters display, doesn't work for me and feels unnatural to a cops life.The overall quality of this show falls of so rapidly that I can't recommend it the slightest.	rookie start quite engage go hell third season one point really push agenda viewer throat obvious poorly do hurt scene early character really complex development newly introduce one shallow clich sassy fbi rookie lady fourth season pinnacle obnoxious self entitlement finally make quit show furthermore whole poshness fancy lifestyle almost character display work feel unnatural cop life overall quality show fall rapidly recommend slight
2	"Overall Game of Thrones is a stellar character-driven medieval fantasy with magic and dragons. The title tell you all you need to know. Power. The pursuit of power, the attainment of power, and the difficulty of holding power. The question is, can they stick the landing. They did not. They had a choice in season 8 to be Shakespearean or to be Dynasty. To be or not to be a tragedy or to be a cliche Hollywood trope. Trope it is. In the beginning the Stark clan is not much of a power player but the Lannister are. By the end they both are consummate duplicitous players. The ""gaslighting"" of Daenerys and Jon over the revelation they are aunt and nephew, which neither were aware of until revealed to them is the worst part of the epic failed ending. A few more minutes in each episode of them attempting to deal with the information, showing them attempting to stay connected physically beyond the meager attempts shown would have made a difference. It left me wondering, does he still really love her? One doesn't know because there no scene of him or her alone struggling with his or her thoughts holding something that represents each other, crying or clutching that object. Hell, Jamie and Cersei got a better fully realized emotional death scene then Daenerys. And Daenerys was just as psychically wounded a character as Cersei was. Why is her death scene so mechanical, cold and to borrow a phrase, done ""with extreme prejudice?"" The justification. She is turning into Colonel Kurtz"" and ""Hitler."" Actually, she is ""gaslighted"" into it by the Starks. She is no longer useful to them and way too powerful to control. She has the dragon. That makes her a superpower. It's hard to kill the dragon now. She is not. Her willingness to use violence is open and has always been known, but so is Arya's. She and Jon and Arya are probably the least duplicitous main characters in the series. The rest of them get others to do the dirty work. The other epic fail of the series end is the unwillingness the treat the Starks and Tyrion as the cunning players for the game of pursuing the throne. They are portrayed as survivors and heroes of the game for the throne. They are not. Nor is Tyrion. As for the assassination of Daenerys, Jon is reduced to a plot prop as ""an errand boy, sent by grocers to collect a bill "" to borrow another phase. Finally, Drogon torching the throne and melting it to the ground isn't because it's represents evil. It's because it belongs to Daenerys and no one will ever sit on it again.

1	I was seriously intriguied when I saw that Nolan an Joy are directing this, but what is this series about? It feels like a super boring adaptation of a video game. No characters to feel engaged with, just blood and gore and unmeaningfull dialogue. Sorry, but where is the fine craftswomanship from Westworld?The main thing that kept me going was the backstory. I loved the vault setting and the flashbacks, but the wasteland was just pointless, like an old western, but with the violence of japanese horror.Maybe I would appreciate if I played the video games, but as an outsider this is just pointless.	seriously intriguied see nolan joy direct series feel like super bore adaptation video game character feel engage blood gore unmeaningfull dialogue sorry fine craftswomanship westworld main thing keep go backstory love vault set flashback wasteland pointless like old western violence japanese horror maybe would appreciate play video game outsider pointless
1	Never played the game and think that is a problem for the series, I don't have a bond with the series to be able to stick with it. I've made it through 4 episodes and whilst not being bad it's not hooked me in to finish it off.If I don't go back to finish it I wouldn't be too bothered about it either.Show started off well and had great hopes for it, it fizzled out into yet another dystopian show with the same factions fighting for survival, gave me snowpiercer vibes.It also feels like Disney got involved in the making of it, some gory scenes followed up by a lot of PG moments. Maybe makes sense if you've played the game but for me it hasn't convinced me enough to finish it off.	never play game think problem series bond series able stick make episode whilst bad hook finish go back finish bother either show start well great hop fizzle yet another dystopian show faction fight survival give snowpiercer vibe also feel like disney get involve make gory scene follow lot pg moment maybe make sense play game convince enough finish
1	I absolutely love romance and drama. The characters are pretty interesting, and it's a good show to zone out on. I do like the show, and i'll probably watch every single episode. However, the show contains an unhealthy amount of political bias. Characters are constantly criticizing the president and constitutional laws. The writers attempt to depict a Christian is theologically off in every single way. I don't know how the writers are still paid to write such bad television.	absolutely love romance drama character pretty interest good show zone like show probably watch every single episode however show contain unhealthy amount political bias character constantly criticize president constitutional law writer attempt depict christian theologically every single way know writer still pay write bad television

Several characters introduced that were completely forgotten, pieces of stories that never had a ""conclusion"", the woke part of the series was like the only thing they could use as a writing excuse. Overall, 3rd season was bored, with just a couple of good episodes. Season 4, well, I am not sure how it is going to end but now it is worst than just boring ... It is pointless. It is a pity, it was a excellent series that I was always recommending it, but now I have to say that it is at most 2 complete seasons of 4 watchable. The rating here could be misguided, many ppl probably gave this show an 8 or a 9 because of the first season, but tbh, last 2 seasons were terrible boring.Is it terrible bad? Not sure, I've watched worst things, but you should not sit and watch this show thinking that it will be something memorable, otherwise you are going to hate spending more than +80 hrs of your life on story that will break apart week after week, and eventually you will believe this is a 1 star series like many recent reviewers."	nd season really good nice episode overall experience somehow end nd season amaze rd season storytelle mess several character introduce completely forget piece story never conclusion wake part series like thing could use write excuse overall rd season bore couple good episode season well sure go end bad bore pointless pity excellent series always recommend say complete season watchable rat could misguide many ppl probably give show first season tbh last season terrible bore terrible bad sure watch bad thing sit watch show think something memorable otherwise go hate spend hrs life story break apart week week eventually believe star series like many recent reviewer
2	"I have read books and the Chinese TV version series, and the speed and rewriting is OK for me. They have the soul of the book. The biggest problem is that many important concepts in the original book have not been explained in detail ,such as quantum entanglement. We can stop and Google while reading , but not when watching TV. Also concept like ""Technology lock"" If the play spend an extra 30 seconds explaining each concept, it would be much better. Audiences can have a clearer understanding of what challenges is facing. And without those Concepts, it's just another ""aliens come to get things from us"" story."	read book chinese tv version series speed rewrite ok soul book big problem many important concept original book explain detail quantum entanglement stop google read watch tv also concept like technology lock play spend extra second explain concept would much well audience clear understand challenge face without concept another alien come get thing we story
2	"So I succesfully avoided major spoilers about the show and could binge watch this since the complete Box set came out in early December. The first season was a bit overwhelming, what with all the houses and characters thrown at you. As you may be able to tell, I have not read the source material. Not sure who of the cast had read it beforehand either. So bare that in mind.Now the line Winter is coming is something everyone associates with the show, I just never expected this to come up so early in the show. What is surprising, at least during the first seasons of the show, is how many supposedly main characters fail to survive. This keeps the viewers on their tows. Towards the end of the show this gets a bit watered down. Not sure how much influence the original author had there (he had only written material for the first 6 seasons of the show, the rest was made up).Having said that, you can feel a drop in quality. And while I have friend who thought the second season was boring (it's a bit of a travelling show and things get stretched quite a bit), if he continued to watch, he might feel even worse with the last seasons. Even though they are shorter (episode wise, not time wise per episode), they feel stretched even more.Also the conclusion (no worries, I'm not telling) is anticlimatic to say the least. It feels bad and the continuity errors are just thrown aside. So if not for the epic battles and the actors, who are all really amazing in this, I might have gone farther down with my vote. Then again, if it wasn't for the last season specifically, I might have given it a 10 too ... A prequel show has been axed for now (not sure if the bad reviews and or numbers for the last season played a role), but I would watch it. This achieved overall something that ""The Reign"" could not: combine violence, fantasy and nudity into something mature/adult that works for men and women watching"	succesfully avoid major spoiler show could binge watch since complete box set come early december first season bite overwhelm house character throw may able tell read source material sure cast read beforehand either bare mind line winter come something everyone associate show never expect come early show surprise least first season show many supposedly main character fail survive keep viewer tow towards end show get bite water sure much influence original author write material first season show rest make say feel drop quality friend think second season bore bite travel show thing get stretch quite bite continue watch might feel even bad last season even though short episode wise time wise per episode feel stretch even also conclusion worry tell anticlimatic say least feel bad continuity error throw aside epic battle actor really amaze might go far vote last season specifically might give prequel show ax sure bad review number last season play role would watch achieve overall something reign could combine violence fantasy nudity something mature adult work man woman watch
2	As a gamer, I find it pretty embarrassing looking at some of the 1 or 2 star reviews that seem based on idealised visions of a game from 27 years ago. It's not 1997, folks, you can step out of Vault 13 and look at the world around you and see how it has evolved.Placing the games to one side, this is a highly enjoyable series. The main cast members are great in their respective roles - I particularly enjoyed Walton Goggins but all three inhabit their characters well. The large array of side characters also provide plenty of interest and there's some really tight performances throughout the 8 episodes.The visual effects range from stellar to just acceptable. This is a tv programme though and not a $400m, 2-hour, blockbuster, movie so it may be advantageous to set your expectations accordingly.I'll keep my fingers crossed that this is received well by the general viewership and that we can see this pushing into further seasons - it'd be a real shame if the opinions of some review-bombing or gatekeeping gamers affected the future of this satisfying show.	gamer find pretty embarrass look star review seem base idealise vision game year ago folk step vault look world around see evolve place game one side highly enjoyable series main cast member great respective role particularly enjoy walton goggin three inhabit character well large array side character also provide plenty interest really tight performance throughout episode visual effect range stellar acceptable tv programme though hour blockbuster movie may advantageous set expectation accordingly keep finger cross receive well general viewership see push season real shame opinion review bomb gatekeepe gamer affect future satisfy show

The acting, especially Maximus, his squire, and to a lesser extent, Lucy, drag the show down. The guy who plays Maximus is especially terrible. The writing is especially awful. Very little of the dialogue is unique or interesting. None of it is funny or thought-provoking to me. You would think that a highly anticipated TV show with Amazon and a Nolan behind it could have been done better. I guess this is just the world we live in. A race by streaming companies to provide as much content as possible without placing emphasis on some of the basic elements to a good TV show: writing and acting.

It is generally good, I would say typical Bethesda. Not the strongest point, but well written.Why not 10/10?I missed the even deeper darkness of the first two games. It wasn't particularly cruel. Could go deeper.Could use somewhat slower pace, more episodes, more focus on individual characters, they could have been deeper.Missing NCR flaws.VaultTec storyline.

1	Although I think they are doing a great job with acting and the visuals it seems they are deviating from the book when it isn't necessary. The ability of Blackthorne to learn the language and actually accept the culture is being changed. His friendship with Rodriguez and fight against the Portuguese aren't being used. The machinations of Toranaga are being shortchanged. The village headman being revealed as a samurai working for Toranaga isn't revealed until the end of the book. Although dated now, the mini series in 1980 did a better job of conveying the book. The politics and the moves made by Lady Ochiba and Lady Mariko are not being utilized correctly. The back story on why the Lady Ochiba hates Toranaga should have been explored. Translating a book to the screen is always difficult but they are falling short. Having said that if you haven't read the book I'm sure it's easier to enjoy it.	although think great job act visual seem deviate book necessary ability blackthorne learn language actually accept culture change friendship rodriguez fight portuguese use machination toranaga shortchange village headman reveal samurai work toranaga reveal end book although date mini series well job convey book politic move make lady ochiba lady mariko utilize correctly back story lady ochiba hat toranaga explore translate book screen always difficult fall short say read book sure easy enjoy

1	I have never read the book but I loved the original mini series with Richard Chamberlin. The first 2 episodes were some of the best television that I have seen in a long time and I couldn't wait to see more. The Asian actors are amazing and the intricate plotting against the beautiful scenery is impressive. The costume design is the best I have seen on tv since Game of Thrones.Unfortunately much of the rest of the series does not live up to the promising start. I put most of the blame for this on the way the series portrays Blackthorne. The actor acts more like a big goofy frat boy than a hardened seaman. As a navigator he would have to be fairly intelligent but we never really see this. There is no chemistry with Mariko. We are told that they are deeply in love but we never really see this relationship develop. He never really seems to be a major character in the story.I found the finale very disappointing. After all of the plotting, buildup and lives sacrificed I expected more.	never read book love original mini series richard chamberlin first episode good television see long time wait see asian actor amaze intricate plot beautiful scenery impressive costume design well see tv since game throne unfortunately much rest series live promise start put blame way series portray blackthorne actor act like big goofy frat boy harden seaman navigator would fairly intelligent never really see chemistry mariko tell deeply love never really see relationship develop never really seem major character story find finale disappoint plot buildup live sacrifice expect

Being a big Fallout fan, I honestly was a bit skeptical to see how Todd Howard could try to not adapt the games into this story and instead go with a whole new story that goes differently than the OG games or the Bethesda titles. But I kinda like it.The goods. First, the characters are actually well developed. Lucy, out main character, is quite charming and enjoyable to follow along as she tries to look for her father whom as taken from her in the Vault (Fallout 3 copy?). She does see the world outside in a more positive outlook in life, as a naïve Vault Dweller would, but would soon see it differently.The Ghoul was another great ensemble to the characters. A once TV star that has endured the 200 years above ground and is now a bounty hunter that is also at risk of turning feral. It's also great that we have flashbacks of his past before the Great War.Another great highlight is the story itself. Suffice to say it has everything a good story should have, plus the humor and charm that the Fallout games possess. Music, aesthetic, and of course, the whole plot with the Vaults like in any other Fallout game.The only thing I would've loved to see was more backstory on the NCR and what happened to the rest of them when Shady Sands was destroyed. But crossing my fingers season 2 will tap into the New Vegas lore.I would say Fallout is a great TV show to watch. And it's one thing that actually works in the minds of Todd Howard.	know put fallout really take surprise big fallout fan honestly bite skeptical see todd howard could try adapt game story instead go whole new story go differently og game bethesda title kinda like good first character actually well develop lucy main character quite charm enjoyable follow along try look father take vault fallout copy see world outside positive outlook life na vault dweller would would soon see differently ghoul another great ensemble character tv star endure year grind bounty hunter also risk turn feral also great flashback past great war another great highlight story suffice say everything good story plus humor charm fallout game possess music aesthetic course whole plot vault like fallout game thing would love see backstory ncr happen rest shady sand destroy cross finger season tap new vegas lore would say fallout great tv show watch one thing actually work mind todd howard
2	"WOW, I watched the pilot this morning and it was way impressive.Honestly, I had no hope for this show. I figured after ""Firefly"" and ""Castle"" that Nathan Fillion was just on the Jump-the-Shark train from now on, especially after the controversial ending of ""Castle"" and issues with his co-star Stana Katic. Well--I was wrong! I was riveted, the Pilot was really good!Sure, a little bit of Nathan Fillion spilled out, but that's what makes him who he is and it was tolerable. He didn't go into the Brooding Mal or the silly Castle--he was just right. He actually looks like he got into shape to play this role, kudos to him for working so hard. Let's face it, he's a good looking man, and here he looks like he did in ""Firefly"" with just a few more smile lines.I stuck around to watch eps. 2 and 3. And I am totally on board. It's an eye opening procedural that really shows what rookies in the LAPD must go through. The fact that it's from the perspective of a 40 something year old rookie definitely gives an interesting twist!There is drama, action, emotion, heart and humor. AND the police body cam shots are new and interesting, they really add to the experience. I give a huge double thumbs up, go and watch it! If you like police procedurals or Nathan Fillion you can't go wrong.Oh, and if the writer's are reading, please have some guest stars from the ""Firefly"" and ""Castle"" days. that would be cool! ;)"	wow watch pilot morning way impressive honestly hope show figure firefly castle nathan fillion jump shark train especially controversial end castle issue co star stana katic well wrong rivet pilot really good sure little bite nathan fillion spill make tolerable go brood mal silly castle right actually look like get shape play role kudo work hard let face good look man look like firefly smile line stick around watch eps totally board eye open procedural really show rookie lapd must go fact perspective something year old rookie definitely give interest twist drama action emotion heart humor police body cam shot new interest really add experience give huge double thumb go watch like police procedural nathan fillion go wrong oh writer read please guest star firefly castle day would cool
0	Great cinematography, and acting by the Japanese actors, everything else weak. Starts off promising then gets dull. A ton of proverbs that mean nothing. Constant pointless flashbacks. A slow build with the lure of a big payoff - that never happens. Zero humour. If by episode 6 you are bored, stop. It doesn't get better. Why do I need so many freaking characters in my review ?! Ugh, ok. The Caucasian lead has a face that looks weird, because it doesn't move. Are male actors getting Botox now ? There are much better shows out there. Zero chance I'd watch another season. Ok, finally enough characters to end my review.	great cinematography act japanese actor everything else weak start promise get dull ton proverb mean nothing constant pointless flashback slow build lure big payoff never happen zero humour episode bore stop get well need many freak character review ugh ok caucasian lead face look weird move male actor get botox much well show zero chance watch another season ok finally enough character end review
1	"I've never read the source material but I can't imagine the 5 ""geniuses"" being this annoying and unbelievable - especially, Salazar. She is the most unlikeable character of all time and I'm supposed to believe she created some nano-tech that would have required collaboration with other people? What other people could stand to be in a room with her for more than 5 minutes. The actor who plays her is awful too.Actually all the actors are awful except Liam, Wong, and the guy who plays Will.The story has some great moments but those moments quickly fade as the ""geniuses"" plan this ridiculous mission to send a human brain into outer space.It would have been a better story if they would have focused on what these scientists are really doing at CERN? Enough with the aliens from outer space garbage. That was done 50 years ago!!But, again, believing these young scientists created all this and are soooo brilliant is so unbelievable that it is almost impossible to watch.This is a 5 because there are some really cool moments in episodes 2-6. The last two episodes are ridiculous except that they finally get rid of Salazar! I was hoping she'd be wrapped after episode one.

1	I've been a fan of The Rookie from season one, thought it was an excellent concept which a lot of people could relate to (Nolan moving from rural PA to join the LAPD).I think as we move into season five the characters have become more cardboard-like, particularly the new recruit, her character is barely believable.The whole will-they, wont-they with Chen and Bradford is a good angle which has developed well. Yet the Rosiland storyline is being dragged out too much.Overall, its still a good watch and its own unique style, but compared to other PD dramas such as Blue Bloods or Chicago PD, its got a lot of catching up to do.	fan rookie season one think excellent concept lot people could relate nolan move rural pa join lapd think move season five character become cardboard like particularly new recruit character barely believable whole will not chen bradford good angle develop well yet rosiland storyline drag much overall still good watch unique style compare pd drama blue blood chicago pd get lot catch
1	"To quote Eddie Murphy: ""If you're starving and somebody throw you a cracker you gonna be like this: Goddang, that's the best cracker I ever ate in my life!""Shogun is such a cracker.It's an ok show, but nothing special compared to actually great TV shows.However, we live in a time of DEI-infested garbage entertainment and bad writing, so regular audiences have a hunger for TV shows and movies that at least don't suck.Shogun isn't bad, but it's not great either.Production quality is high and the acting is fine, albeit Cosmo Jarvis comes across as a caricature in the main role.The pacing is slow and it's very hard to get invested in any of the plethora of characters, or the uncompelling plotline. I wouldn't call it boring, but just too much work for too little payoff.While I understand the high rating when compared to what else is out there right now, please don't expect a show that can compete with a pre-woke era show with a 9+ rating.It's a nice cracker, but that's all."	quote eddie murphy starve somebody throw cracker go to like goddang good cracker ever eat life shogun cracker ok show nothing special compare actually great tv show however live time dei infest garbage entertainment bad write regular audience hunger tv show movie least suck shogun bad great either production quality high act fine albeit cosmo jarvis come across caricature main role pace slow hard get invest plethora character uncompelle plotline call bore much work little payoff understand high rat compare else right please expect show compete pre wake era show rat nice cracker
0	A muddled mess interposing things from the novels with things not in them and completely out of order. If you haven't read the books it's probably a 2/10 as the series is a jumbled mess.The novels are an immense sci-fi opera with a massive scope and beautifully woven together to lead you through a series of philosophical and complex scientific ideas to conclude with a terrifying premise.The 3 body problem is a genuinely unsolvable scientific problem. Another unsolvable question is the Fermi Paradox posed by the brilliant mathematician Enrico Fermi when he asked 'where is everybody', these novels propose a worrying answer.	muddle mess interpose thing novel thing completely order read book probably series jumble mess novel immense sci fi opera massive scope beautifully weave together lead series philosophical complex scientific idea conclude terrify premise body problem genuinely unsolvable scientific problem another unsolvable question fermi paradox pose brilliant mathematician enrico fermi ask everybody novel propose worry answer

2	"With only 2 episodes out so far, I find this show to be really well done whether or not you have read the book or saw the 1980 mini-series with Richard Chamberlain. Hiroyuki Sanada is one of my favourite actors and his performance, as well as the other cast members is superb. The show is very authentic looking and most of the dialogue is in Japanese, which really adds to the atmosphere and gives you a sense of being in 1600s Japan. Except for one scene (IMHO), the cinematography is really good. Unlike the 1980 series, there is a darker ""feel"" which better portrays what was going on at that time. Looking forward to seeing the rest of the series."	episode far find show really well do whether read book see mini series richard chamberlain hiroyuki sanada one favourite actor performance well cast member superb show authentic look dialogue japanese really add atmosphere give sense japan except one scene imho cinematography really good unlike series darker feel well portray go time look forward see rest series

1	"The story of a stalker. More broadly, the study of how unstable people find each other and do further damage to themselves and others.A true story written and performed by Richard Gadd, who once felt bad for a strange woman spinning tall tales at his workplace one day. What happens next is a tragedy of errors immortalized in text, film, and police reports. Along the way, Richard grapples with the growing awareness that he might (in fact) be part of the problem in his own life, and an active source of harm to others. Drama ensues.This series directly addresses themes of pity, self-loathing, and vulnerability. More authentically, ""Baby Reindeer"" represents life with a personality disorder through the eyes of a sufferer.The principal theme appears to by ""pity,"" both as the condition the Author feels for his stalker and the technique by which he maneuvers through life or manipulates others into meeting his needs. It is this same pity he requires from us, the audience: both in his fantasy routines as a sad clown comedian, and the actual effect of this series. Richard needs us to feel bad for him as a victim of circumstance/grooming/stalking as an excuse for his admitted neglect and mistreatment of those unlucky enough to wander into his path.While ""Baby Reindeer"" is well-acted and thoughtfully composed, the Author's manipulation of the audience detracts from its quality. The startling absence of any personal growth or redemption arc leaves us feeling like we've been cornered by a burned-out narcissist at a bar instead of leading us to a moral conclusion about life, relationships, or the development of virtue. It is abundantly clear this man needs serious help - not just from a ""therapist"" he found on a dating website, but probably an actual psychiatrist who can help level out the extremes in his thinking/behavior long enough to respond to talk therapy. This is the extent of my pity for the Author and his potentially wasted life experience.Bonus points for accurately illustrating modern-day London as a dark and depraved cesspool of Babylonian proportions."	story stalker broadly study unstable people find damage other true story write perform richard gadd feel bad strange woman spin tall tale workplace one day happen next tragedy error immortalize text film police report along way richard grapple grow awareness might fact part problem life active source harm other drama ensue series directly address theme pity self loathe vulnerability authentically baby reindeer represent life personality disorder eye sufferer principal theme appear pity condition author feel stalker technique maneuver life manipulate other meet need pity require us audience fantasy routine sad clown comedian actual effect series richard need we feel bad victim circumstance groom stalk excuse admit neglect mistreatment unlucky enough wander path baby reindeer well act thoughtfully compose author manipulation audience detract quality startle absence personal growth redemption arc leave we feel like corner burn narcissist bar instead lead we moral conclusion life relationship development virtue abundantly clear man need serious help therapist find date website probably actual psychiatrist help level extreme think behavior long enough respond talk therapy extent pity author potentially waste life experience bonus point accurately illustrate modern day london dark deprave cesspool babylonian proportion

But tonight I decided to give it another shot and I am really glad that I did. The second half of episode 1 and all of episode 2 were really quite good. Now I am hooked and looking forward to seeing what's next.I don't mind having to read subtitles for a portion of each episode, and I certainly couldn't care less about whether the Portuguese explorers and the Catholics from centuries ago are portrayed as the bad guys (at least so far).Good character development and developing plot lines seem to be setting up for an interesting path forward. Despite what other people have said about this series, there has not been any nudity or sex scenes through the first two episodes.Worth a watch for sure.	almost give show halfway first episode actually turn start rewatche game throne hbo max tonight decide give another shoot really glad second half episode episode really quite good hook look forward see next mind read subtitle portion episode certainly care less whether portuguese explorer catholic century ago portray bad guy least far good character development develop plot line seem set interest path forward despite people say series nudity sex scene first two episode worth watch sure

She and her holier than thou sister Meredith just set my teeth on edge with the way they think they are always right and everyone else is always wrong. UG! Case in point - a man moved across the country for Meredith but does she even bother to tell him before sending a global email that she is moving to Boston? Nope. Selfish. And now in season 19 ep16 Amelia is displaying cluelessness about her horrible sisters. Can't wait for Maggie to JUST GO TO CHICAGO! But there are enough other characters that are not obnoxious to make it worthwhile to watch! Guess I'll just have to keep yelling at the Tv.

0	Given the excellent episodic series we have seen on TV in recent years, I expected a modern, respectful adaptation of the incredible story of 'Shogun.'Sadly, the result is extremely disappointing. Toranaga is a shadow of his former self, Mariko is nothing like the original character and is downright unbelievable, and Blackthorn has been so diminished that he could almost be removed from the storyline entirely.The incredibly rich and complex story imagined by Clavell has been violated and distorted beyond recognition, but for what exactly? This series can be grouped with 'The Rings of Power' for a futile, pointless distortion of the original storyline, where only the title and the names of the characters remain, not their personalities.Mariko is inconsistent. Initially, she is outright hostile to Blackthorne, for no apparent reason and in conflict with the tasks required by her leader, Toranaga. Then, she shows some friendliness, only to become irate again, and she speaks to her superiors in a manner that would have been unthinkable during the Japanese feudal era. Granted, if Japan is highly sexist today, it was extremely harsh for women back then. Nevertheless, if you are making a period piece, accuracy is required. The show's writers not only completely disrespect the original story but also any semblance of historical accuracy.The offense continues with Lady Ochiba taking control of the Council of Regents (not in the story) simply because she asked for it. This utter nonsense, which would never have happened, of course, fits the political agenda of showcasing strong female characters to satisfy modern sensibilities. It's a pure political manifesto, overriding truth, historical accuracy, and storyline-no more, no less than Soviet propaganda in post-revolution Russia.The violation continues with the portrayal of Toranaga as a leader who openly states his thoughts, a complete reversal from the actual character. There's barely any trace of the real Toranaga, his military and political genius, or the majesty that Toshiro Mifune so perfectly embodied in the excellent 1980s series.Father Alvito and all the plots involving the Portuguese priests are almost gone, though they were integral to the story. Losing these elements means losing the Hitchcockian aspects of the thriller that ran parallel to the story of Blackthorne learning to understand Japanese culture. These parallel stories of intrigue and political interference are what made the book and the 1980s TV series so satisfying. It seems the creators of the messy 2024 pastiche have little trust in the audience's ability to follow that storyline. To them, I suggest watching the otherwise fantastic 'Ripley.'The costumes are lavish and the cinematography is adequate, although it suffers from the current trend of making many scenes dull, grey, and uninspiring, all based on the misguided concept of 'realism' aided by the artificiality of digital cameras. It's acceptable but not noteworthy.There are many other issues, but mentioning them all would make this review overly lengthy. The verdict is: stay away, read the book instead, or watch the 1980s series with Chamberlain and Mifune.	give excellent episodic series see tv recent year expect modern respectful adaptation incredible story shogun sadly result extremely disappoint toranaga shadow former self mariko nothing like original character downright unbelievable blackthorn diminish could almost remove storyline entirely incredibly rich complex story imagine clavell violate distort beyond recognition exactly series group ring power futile pointless distortion original storyline title name character remain personality mariko inconsistent initially outright hostile blackthorne apparent reason conflict task require leader toranaga show friendliness become irate speak superior manner would unthinkable japanese feudal era grant japan highly sexist today extremely harsh woman back nevertheless make period piece accuracy require show writer completely disrespect original story also semblance historical accuracy offense continue lady ochiba take control council regent story simply ask utter nonsense would never happen course fit political agenda showcase strong female character satisfy modern sensibility pure political manifesto override truth historical accuracy storyline less soviet propaganda post revolution russia violation continue portrayal toranaga leader openly state thought complete reversal actual character barely trace real toranaga military political genius majesty toshiro mifune perfectly embody excellent series father alvito plot involve portuguese priest almost go though integral story lose element mean lose hitchcockian aspect thriller run parallel story blackthorne learn understand japanese culture parallel story intrigue political interference make book tv series satisfy seem creator messy pastiche little trust audience ability follow storyline suggest watch otherwise fantastic ripley costume lavish cinematography adequate although suffer current trend make many scene dull grey uninspire base misguide concept realism aid artificiality digital camera acceptable noteworthy many issue mention would make review overly lengthy verdict stay away read book instead watch series chamberlain mifune

I read approximately one book in two years and feel proud of this incredible achievement for the next five.I've always hated when people compared movies to books and said one or the other is better.It's like comparing a sculpture to an oil painting -- either one can be equally sh&^t and its nothing to do with the medium.You can't do that.I'm now going to do that.There is Contact by Carl Sagan and there is Contact by Robert Zemeckis. The later one is more simplified, more hollywoodised and even got a still-in-a-rom-com-mode-Matthew-McConaughey in it.Both of these two are great. I loved the book and I love rewatching the movie over and over again ever since it came out.There is The Martian by Andy Weir and The Martian by Matt damn it, by Ridley Scott.Both are hollywoodised, both are not simplified, neither has still-in-a-rom-com-mode-Matthew-McConaughey in it, both are great.There is Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang and there is Arrival by Denis Villeneuve.

Clarke and there is 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick.There is Solaris by Stanislaw Lem and there is Solaris by Andrei Tarkovsky (sorry George)And then there is The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin and... there is this.This, where a nanomaterials researcher looks and acts like a spoiled entitled supermodel, where soapy relationships of freshly made-up characters are more important than anything else happening in the first 500 pages of the book, and where the ""entire Universe"" thinks so little of its viewers' intelligence it flickers in visible light.(so visible you can see it at night even when a glowing display is stuck to your retinas)I can't compare this series to The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin.It'd be like comparing a Mona Lisa painting to a sculpture of her nose made out of a sweet potato.The only thing I can think of comparing it to is Foundation by Apple Tv.Because of the way these two treat the unique, extraordinary ideas bestowed upon them by their source materials, they, together with their creators, have a special place reserved for them in hell."	movie guy read approximately one book two year feel proud incredible achievement next five always hat people compare movie book say one well like compare sculpture oil paint either one equally sh nothing medium go contact carl sagan contact robert zemeckis later one simplify hollywoodise even get still rom com mode matthew mcconaughey two great love book love rewatche movie ever since come martian andy weir martian matt damn ridley scott hollywoodise simplify neither still rom com mode matthew mcconaughey great story life te chiang arrival denis villeneuve movie must every sci fi lover yet read novel nebula thanos daughter award sure amaze book daughter space odyssey arthur c clarke space odyssey stanley kubrick solaris stanislaw lem solaris andrei tarkovsky sorry george three body problem liu cixin nanomaterials researcher look act like spoil entitle supermodel soapy relationship freshly make character important anything else happen first page book entire universe think little viewer intelligence flicker visible light visible see night even glow display stick retinas compare series three body problem liu cixin like compare mona lisa paint sculpture nose make sweet potato thing think compare foundation apple tv way two treat unique extraordinary idea bestow upon source material together creator special place reserve hell
2	When I say I am a huge fan of the books, it's a big time understatement. I've studied them intensely and participated in discussions about all kinds of things. I gave it a 8 out of 10 because without the source material there was a very tall mountain to climb. The books contain much more magic, darker twists and way too many characters for a television series. They did a very satisfying job wrapping up the greatest story over told considering such.9 out of 10 particularly because not only was it a fun enjoyable show, the acting was amazing. The cinematography was amazing, the CGI was amazing, the directing was amazing. If I have one major critique it was the quality of the dialogue more than the direction of the story that made the final seasons feel different than the beginning. Some characters became one-dimensional caricatures of themselves, including unfortunately Tyrion, Cersei, Jon. Euron is the show's biggest failure.But still I will always love this show for bringing these characters to the small screen.	say huge fan book big time understatement study intensely participate discussion kind thing give without source material tall mountain climb book contain much magic dark twist way many character television series satisfy job wrap great story tell consider particularly fun enjoyable show act amaze cinematography amaze cgi amaze direct amaze one major critique quality dialogue direction story make final season feel different begin character become one dimensional caricature include unfortunately tyrion cersei jon euron show big failure still always love show bring character small screen

1	"Not a big sci-fi fan, but I live with one who was overly excited to see this adaptation of a Chinese trilogy of books. As you can imagine, I was less than eager. I do understand from readers of the books that this is a hard trilogy to depict on screen...which explains the heavy use of CGI and in more than just ""the game"".In the eight episodes that make up season one there are two timelines running...one contemporary and one in the 1960's China under Chairman Mao's regime. In fact that is where the story starts (a deviation from the timeline of the original books), with the public beating and death of a physics teacher with his daughter in witness. His daughter ends up in a lumber work camp...and eventually is brought to a remote research center that is trying to communicate with an alien race who eventually answers back thanks to her disobeying a direct order. The real question becomes did she doom the human race thanks to that one decision?Meanwhile in contemporary times science is no longer making sense and a whole series of scientists appear to be killing themselves. There is a group investigating all of this, there are shiny helmets that seem to have advanced technology and involve playing a game, there is a countdown, the stars wink...there is a floating ark with a group who seem to believe the aliens are our saviors in a religious fanatic kind of way...and then there is the most unbelievable part of the whole story: five friends in the U. K. seem to be the smartest minds in the world and seem to have all of these events happening to and around them?!?!?!I don't want to get in to the science or lack-there-of, because I am an applied scientist not a theoretical one and while complex theories are mentioned or talked around...they are never explained in detail.I enjoyed Liam Cunningham's character Thomas Wade tremendously. I think he and his interactions are some of the best in the series. I enjoyed the comedy (intentional or not) between him and actor Benedict Wong who plays his underling Da Shi. The friends for the most part I found super annoying and most unbelievable as theoretical (or otherwise) physicists! There was the weirdest vibe between Auggie Salazar and Jin Cheng...and if the fate of the human race is in the pot smoking ambitious-less Saul Durand hands, we are in so much trouble. Although I am enjoying the ""I refuse"" and no one believing...great comedy.Marlo Kelly plays a great villainous character in Tatiana. She has creepy down to perfection. I enjoyed the concept of not trusting someone who admits to having told a lie...and the bug analogy, seemed at the time like there were better analogies that could have been made, but it ends up working in to the story so perfectly with ""the message"" and then Da Shi's pep talk. So, in the end I enjoyed it. The Panama Canal scene...while overly CGI'd was interesting. I am also really enjoying Saamer Usmani who plays Raj Varma, he is amazing. I think the character of Jin Cheng needs to wake up and smell the coffee and realize how good she has it with Raj...because frankly he could do better.The show was ok, but kind of middle of the road for a sci-fi series. Didn't make me want to read the book or watch more necessarily...especially since I didn't really find anyone to root for in this depiction."	big sci fi fan live one overly excite see adaptation chinese trilogy book imagine less eager understand reader book hard trilogy depict screen explain heavy use cgi game eight episode make season one two timeline run one contemporary one china chairman mao regime fact story start deviation timeline original book public beat death physics teacher daughter witness daughter end lumber work camp eventually bring remote research center try communicate alien race eventually answer back thank disobey direct order real question become doom human race thank one decision meanwhile contemporary time science long make sense whole series scientist appear kill group investigate shiny helmet seem advance technology involve play game countdown star wink float ark group seem believe alien savior religious fanatic kind way unbelievable part whole story five friend u k seem smart mind world seem event happen around want get science lack apply scientist theoretical one complex theory mention talk around never explain detail enjoy liam cunningham character thomas wade tremendously think interaction good series enjoy comedy intentional actor benedict wong play underle da shi friend part find super annoy unbelievable theoretical otherwise physicist weirdest vibe auggie salazar jin cheng fate human race pot smoke ambitious less saul durand hand much trouble although enjoy refuse one believe great comedy marlo kelly play great villainous character tatiana creepy perfection enjoy concept trust someone admit tell lie bug analogy seem time like well analogy could make end work story perfectly message da shi pep talk end enjoy panama canal scene overly cgi interest also really enjoy saamer usmani play raj varma amaze think character jin cheng need wake smell coffee realize good raj frankly could well show ok kind middle road sci fi series make want read book watch necessarily especially since really find anyone root depiction

The artists did a great job on the visual design, the visual effects are acceptable, and the characters are motivated and their conflicts are readable.The painted inhabitants of the wasteland may seem too plastic, as well as power armor, but the degree of discrepancy does not cause strong dissonance and you can put up with these conventions, because the series has an intriguing plot and voluminous characters. Each character is endowed with an individual character, background, beliefs - you sympathize with them and worry about them.However, it may seem to some viewers that the plot is too focused on personal drama, which is why the series sometimes sags on protracted explanations, which can cause fatigue. Despite this, the film can captivate with intriguing twists, and the atmosphere of the film corresponds to the game lore, which will appeal to fans, but, unfortunately, it does not immerse into the world of the apocalypse, does not convey the threat and struggle for survival, but entertains with bright colors and comical characters. The role of Walton Goggins, who created the colorful, hardened ""The Ghoul"", stands out in particular. Aaron Moten does not seem to me suitable for the image of a knight lover, in my opinion, the casting director should have looked for a more suitable actor: it is somewhat annoying to see his surprised face. Ella Purnell, who was chosen for the role of a resident of the asylum, plays reliably, she emotionally conveys the image of a woman whose worldview will change as the plot develops. In general, the picture was not bypassed by processing for compliance with the quotas of inclusivity and respect for racial diversity, but fortunately, the picture will not focus on gender guidelines.Before watching the movie series ""Fallout"", I was skeptical, but when I started watching, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of work on the script, bold jokes and a realistic look at the post-apocalyptic world. Although I am not a fan of the game, but only played in ""Fallout 3"", I accepted the world of the movie series without a doubt and gladly immersed myself in its atmosphere of radiation and the tragedy of human destinies.As I said, there is too much drama in the picture, from the controversial novice of the brotherhood to the hypocritical caretaker of the asylum. This tragedy, in my opinion, is overloaded, there is clearly not enough humor for balance. It is black humor that sets the crazy pace of post-apocalyptic fun, but it sags under the plot necessity - to build a structure of motives and goals. Rather, this is a feature of the series, not a disadvantage. It's very difficult to please or balance emotions, and I don't blame the authors - they did a good job, and this work is at a decent creative level."	good quality post apocalyptic film adaptation game universe fill black humor comical cruelty film recommend viewer age fifth series stand particular excellent direct well develop script create eccentric adventure complex character artist great job visual design visual effect acceptable character motivate conflict readable paint inhabitant wasteland may seem plastic well power armor degree discrepancy cause strong dissonance put convention series intrigue plot voluminous character character endow individual character background belief sympathize worry however may seem viewer plot focus personal drama series sometimes sag protract explanation cause fatigue despite film captivate intrigue twist atmosphere film correspond game lore appeal fan unfortunately immerse world apocalypse convey threat struggle survival entertain bright color comical character role walton goggin create colorful harden ghoul stand particular aaron moten seem suitable image knight lover opinion cast director look suitable actor somewhat annoy see surprise face ella purnell choose role resident asylum play reliably emotionally convey image woman whose worldview change plot develop general picture bypass process compliance quota inclusivity respect racial diversity fortunately picture focus gender guideline watch movie series fallout skeptical start watch pleasantly surprise quality work script bold joke realistic look post apocalyptic world although fan game play fallout accept world movie series without doubt gladly immerse atmosphere radiation tragedy human destiny say much drama picture controversial novice brotherhood hypocritical caretaker asylum tragedy opinion overload clearly enough humor balance black humor set crazy pace post apocalyptic fun sag plot necessity build structure motive goal rather feature series disadvantage difficult please balance emotion blame author good job work decent creative level
1	I read a review on this comparing it to an expansive saga that was beyond GOT but now I'm not sure if they were on something or watching something else. The blame had to fall this time mainly on the director. Ok, maybe this would make more sense if I remember the original or read the book and maybe it makes more sense with the last two parts, but all I got from this was some convoluted story and some pretty pictures and eye candy. Of course you have to have some bad blank female and an attack on our obviously patriarchical culture but c'mon. Nothing really makes much sense and the historical parts that ham fisted in are too much and too repetitive. It's true, that the japanese considered the portugese as uncivilized savages but do they really need to keep hammering this. (interesting aside, in the greek days anyone who wasn't greek and spoke creek was referred to as a barbarian or one who babbled, which got adopted by the romans and the name barbara literally means woman of the man who babbles, google it). The japanese culture was minimalist because they all live on islands and because they had to place a moratorium on cutting trees before there were no more trees. The japanese were also a warlike society and there was constant infighting but if everyone committed suicide so easy you have to wonder how there was anyone left, or how does someone hit forty, when they could be cutting themselves open for almost any bloop. Japan was also a much more open society regarding sex, hence the fisherman's wife and much more patriarchal than depicted. But, they didn't wear the classy outfits like shown. That's for 2024, not 1600s. The worst part though is the story which makes very little sense if you know any history at all. It's very hard to follow the story between the long takes of someone's face punctuated by a twitch here and there. That's nobody else's fault except the director. It's the director's responsibility to tell the story and doesn't include repetitive historical references which most people wouldn't understand today. And one thing glaringly missing is the japanese side to religion. In two episodes they haven't mentioned anything but the adoption of christianity and the persecution but nothing about shinto or buddhism which would have been the primary religion of choice. C'mon.	read review compare expansive saga beyond get sure something watch something else blame fall time mainly director ok maybe would make sense remember original read book maybe make sense last two part get convolute story pretty picture eye candy course bad blank female attack obviously patriarchical culture c mon nothing really make much sense historical part ham fiste much repetitive true japanese consider portugese uncivilized savage really need keep hammer interest aside greek day anyone greek speak creek refer barbarian one babble get adopt romans name barbara literally mean woman man babble google japanese culture minimalist live island place moratorium cut tree tree japanese also warlike society constant infighting everyone commit suicide easy wonder anyone leave someone hit forty could cut open almost bloop japan also much open society regard sex hence fisherman wife much patriarchal depict wear classy outfit like show bad part though story make little sense know history hard follow story long take someone face punctuate twitch nobody else fault except director director responsibility tell story include repetitive historical reference people understand today one thing glaringly miss japanese side religion two episode mention anything adoption christianity persecution nothing shinto buddhism would primary religion choice c mon

0	First 6 seasons were fantastic but after that everything went south and especially season 8 was the worst! It was rushed and i could not make any emotional connection with any of the characters. Simply put, it was bland! The ending was so bad that it feels like you wasted your precious 10 years for nothing!	first season fantastic everything go south especially season bad rush could make emotional connection character simply put bland end bad feel like waste precious year nothing

2	This show has layers! I'm just now starting episode 5. So I'm half way through and I can't imagine how much more Richard Gadd can give us...and how much more Donny can take. You never know where someone has been. The first 3 episodes I had 0 idea that it was a flash forward for episode 4. I would have never known in those first 3 episodes Donny had been through so much! Struggling with confidence, self-identity, intimacy with himself and freedom to barely name a few. I hope to see this show get the accolades it deserves as it brings light to these that should be beautiful and innocent but can be darkened by 1 person at the snap of a finger. Anyway, if you're reading this BE KIND.	show layer start episode half way imagine much richard gadd give we much donny take never know someone first episode idea flash forward episode would never know first episode donny much struggle confidence self identity intimacy freedom barely name hope see show get accolade deserve bring light beautiful innocent darken person snap finger anyway read kind
0	Season 1 was great, fascinating, but each season the show runners could not hide the fact that they are in the defund the police camp. When you do any research about Fillion, he is best pals with far far left loons like Trudeau and his leftist agenda has ruined a great series. The show wants you to hate the cops but identify with the lead characters who are all cops or a rabid leftist lawyer, Show became utterly unwatchable.	season great fascinate season show runner could hide fact defund police camp research fillion good pal far far leave loon like trudeau leftist agenda ruin great series show want hate cop identify lead character cop rabid leftist lawyer show become utterly unwatchable

(except power armor fly animation, motion there was better in 1980s) Items, locations and characters from fallout 4 are precise and looking great.Everything else it gets from bad to worse.Humor, well sometimes depends on your age :P After 3rd episode story becomes very boring, and its starting to focus on moral choices and on not making any sense relation with Lucy and Maximus.Scenes that dont have anything in them last for minutes or are streched beyond reason.Allmost every character in this show is dumb as hell.Scenes of fighting are riddiculus, i dont know if they are dancing or get lost sometimes.Most of things that is happening doesnt make any sense.Survive ability of political correct characters is really annoying.I really enjoyed watching main character - ghul, and tahts it Like the Last of us - another teen movie :( and with such potential ehhmy recomendation - Play Fallout 4 :Das for good adaptaion of a game i recomand Halo.	scenery visual effect well simply amaze except power armor fly animation motion well item location character fallout precise look great everything else get bad bad humor well sometimes depend age p rd episode story become bore start focus moral choice make sense relation lucy maximus scene do not anything last minute streche beyond reason allmost every character show dumb hell scene fight riddiculu do not know dance get lose sometimes thing happen do not make sense survive ability political correct character really annoy really enjoy watch main character ghul taht like last we another teen movie potential ehhmy recomendation play fallout das good adaptaion game recomand halo
1	I was waiting for this so long and here it is the most mediocre show of the year. First of all it's a message between Japanese and English. All characters speaking Japanese . Only one character speaking English. I don't know how will this show survive in today's era. This was so boring , slow and mediocre. No big actors no big sets. Story is very boring and slow. Game of thrones will remain epic even now because it had large production values and character development. 8 more episodes to go and I'm out after watching just one episode. Thatswhy I don't trust shows nowadays. This was very overhyped.	wait long mediocre show year first message japanese english character speak japanese one character speak english know show survive today era bore slow mediocre big actor big set story bore slow game throne remain epic even large production value character development episode go watch one episode thatswhy trust show nowadays overhype
0	I wonder if I'm the only person that thinks that these shows should maybe cast a believable actor to play a role?Nano physicist? Think you want a 30 ish year old female who likes going out drinking with friends.Boss of a particle accelerator? 40s female pleaseSeems that there's so many shows these days that are cast by children for children - a child might believe that these people are believable in the roles they have but anyone else has to suspend their disbelief whilst watching a character literally having to tell another character - and you - how well qualified and amazing they are.The whole girl boss meme that has become quite well known might be reductive but also is clearly evident here, as the lead character threatens Nick Frost character that she'll put her fist through his head and then walks off leaving him cowering. It's just not believably how people behave except in weird Netflix world.	wonder person think show maybe cast believable actor play role nano physicist think want ish year old female like go drink friend boss particle accelerator female pleaseseem many show day cast child child child might believe people believable role anyone else suspend disbelief whilst watch character literally tell another character well qualify amaze whole girl boss meme become quite well know might reductive also clearly evident lead character threaten nick frost character put fist head walk leave cower believably people behave except weird netflix world
2	This is a well done series. The actors are all very good and they all give great performances. The backdrops and scenery are fantastic. I read the book about the same time the original mini series aired. The only down side for me is this one feels a little flat. They've given it a more realistic voice for modern times, but the fire is gone. I kind of miss the old school bombastic Japanize lord. Whether the original series seems more appropriate or not probably depends on your age. I think every generation is more biased against the newer versions. Definitely worth a watch in any case. Will. Looking forward to Gai-jin .	well do series actor good give great performance backdrop scenery fantastic read book time original mini series air side one feel little flat give realistic voice modern time fire go kind miss old school bombastic japanize lord whether original series seem appropriate probably depend age think every generation bias new version definitely worth watch case look forward gai jin
1	This isn't the worst adaption ever (far from it), but neither is it amazing as a standalone piece of entertainment.It's just bland. And unimaginative.Terrible fightscenes. Possibly the worst fight scenes I've seen to date. Apparently we have Steve Battaglia to thank for them, who also made the worst John Wick and Expendable movie fight scenes.Characters are okay. Side characters are kinda funny, sometimes.Dialogue is fine, leagues ahead of anything Netflix generally makes (I have no idea why theirs is uniquely bad).Comedic theme works well with the over the top violence and gore.I'm not a huge fan of the Bethesda Fallout games but they managed to water down their already watered down take of the original IP.Not that that is it's worst quality - that is easily the lack of pressing (character) stakes.Only worth your time if you're really bored.	bad adaption ever far neither amaze standalone piece entertainment bland unimaginative terrible fightscene possibly bad fight scene see date apparently steve battaglia thank also make bad john wick expendable movie fight scene character okay side character kinda funny sometimes dialogue fine league ahead anything netflix generally make idea uniquely bad comedic theme work well top violence gore huge fan bethesda fallout game manage water already water take original ip bad quality easily lack press character stake worth time really bear

0	There's a couple of things I'd mention:1) The characters: I really liked - and disliked - several characters and performances; they have the whole range. But Tyrion was brilliant, and Jorah also stood out to me. Jon Snow was very well developed throughout the seasons. He evolved in a very coherent way, at just the right pace. I'd been missing a hero for the first few seasons, and he clearly became it. Daenerys was very irrelevant to me, despite her obvious importance in the story. I just wasn't feeling her. And by the end, I couldn't stand her.2) The porn: Sex scenes and nudity are used generously, and also randomly - it seems - in the show, for the sole purpose of spicing things up.3) The meaningless story lines: The show seems to have quite a few and felt slow and boring in a lot of parts.4) The ending: Made me glad I binge watched the series and didn't invest 8 years on it, only to feel so unsatisfied by the end. It was still 8 seasons of my time, though. And a story with a bad ending is just a bad story. Nothing made sense, nothing felt right. I hope they do release that Jon Snow spinoff, and make up for their mistakes.	couple thing mention character really like dislike several character performance whole range tyrion brilliant jorah also stand jon snow well develop throughout season evolve coherent way right pace miss hero first season clearly become daenery irrelevant despite obvious importance story feel end stand porn sex scene nudity use generously also randomly seem show sole purpose spice thing meaningless story line show seem quite feel slow bore lot part end make glad binge watch series invest year feel unsatisfied end still season time though story bad end bad story nothing make sense nothing feel right hope release jon snow spinoff make mistake

1	The Rookie is fast paced, always interesting, the right amount of action/drama and these days it's rare but it has a Well written but before story! plus it has Nathan Fillan as the lead! But there are a few certain parts of this show that makes me mad and swear I won't watch the next episode. For one when a 100lb woman whoops a full grown felon in a fist fight and has him in cuffs in 10 seconds. I know that women are being portrayed as bad azz and strong these days but come on this is Completely Ridiculous how writers are writing women now young females are going to watch this and actually think that they can fight a male. And number 2 of things that ruin this show and Many other newer shows is that it is trying too hard to normalize homosexuality... it's in everything now and it's just feeling so forced! I don't have a problem with people being with whoever they want to be with but forcing your agenda down my throat is getting old and boring. I gave it a seven because it's a pretty good show overall.	rookie fast pace always interest right amount action drama day rare well write story plus nathan fillan lead certain part show make mad swear watch next episode one lb woman whoop full grow felon fist fight cuff second know woman portray bad azz strong day come completely ridiculous writer write woman young female go watch actually think fight male number thing ruin show many new show try hard normalize homosexuality everything feel force problem people whoever want force agenda throat get old bore give seven pretty good show overall
0	So, so ,much awful writing.. takes away from great cast and some great potential story... Season 8 is NO exception... basically crap writing.... is what we can expect from the Game of Thrones. Lesson... don't create a series based on books and then try to write it yourselves after that... because you are not the writers and you will likely fall short.... Not planning to engage any prequel or future stories from these guys because they have proven they can't deliver. And I came back to take away another star for the concerted effort of using cast to attack show fans. SHAME ON YOU CAST & ALL FOR ATTACKING FANS for having feelings about the truly badly written season 8. You don't hide people in a CRYPT when fighting a boss that raises the dead.. you don't use a line of dialogue from a character(Jorah) to suddently make a character 'smart' that you have written into idiocy for many seasons.. YOUR STORY TELLING IN SEASON 8 SCREAMS YOU DID NOT CARE ANYMORE D&D!	much awful write take away great cast great potential story season exception basically crap write expect game throne lesson create series base book try write writer likely fall short plan engage prequel future story guy prove deliver come back take away another star concert effort use cast attack show fan shame cast attack fan feel truly badly write season hide people crypt fight boss raise dead use line dialogue character jorah suddently make character smart write idiocy many season story tell season scream care anymore

2	Possibly the toughest series I've ever watched, on so many levels - not least the fact that it's based on a true story.Really had little idea where it was going, and was expecting something quite light hearted, if I'm honest.Light hearted, it isn't.It's a great cast, and the acting is very good.I found it very difficult to like any of the characters at all - and going back to the fact that it's predominantly true - I found myself questioning some of the decisions that were made by the main protagonist.I also found myself wanting to watch some of the scenes (including the stand up routines) through my fingers.Episode 4 is particularly tough.All that said, it's totally engrossing, and brings some huge issues to the fore.	possibly tough series ever watch many level least fact base true story really little idea go expect something quite light hearted honest light hearte great cast act good find difficult like character go back fact predominantly true find question decision make main protagonist also find want watch scene include stand routine finger episode particularly tough say totally engross bring huge issue fore

1	This is one of the longest live running shows to ever exist. And it needs to be stop. The first seasons of this show are incomparable to any other medical show, the drama is so well laid out and gives watchers that same heart racing and sad moments. The show progressively falls of the rails, specifically after Season 11. If you dont want to ruin the experience of this show; end it at Season 11. It is a peaceful and enjoyable ending. If you would like to continue, I'd suggest preparing yourself for disappointment after more disappointment. The same plots of drama get boring and theyre ends up being barely any original characters left. ABC, please end this before you ruin its legacy.	one long live run show ever exist need stop first season show incomparable medical show drama well lie give watcher heart race sad moment show progressively fall rail specifically season do not want ruin experience show end season peaceful enjoyable end would like continue suggest prepare disappointment disappointment plot drama get bore they re end barely original character leave abc please end ruin legacy
2	I'm wondering why so many reviews mention the liking of the John Malkovich interpretation of Thomas Ripley in the movie of that name, yet not once do they mention his portrayal of a different character in this adaptation of The Talented Mr. Ripley in the last few scenes of this production. They have great things to say about this version and they enjoyed the Malkovich movie but don't mention he appears in this new one, why? I can only think it's because they didn't actually watch it until the end, because he doesn't appear until very near the end? Seems like a very odd thing to leave out of their reviews!	wonder many review mention like john malkovich interpretation thomas ripley movie name yet mention portrayal different character adaptation talente mr ripley last scene production great thing say version enjoy malkovich movie mention appear new one think actually watch end appear near end seem like odd thing leave review
2	I enjoyed watching this show episode by episode and I knew it needs a season two more than any other show I have watched. I do fear that the story could burn itself out and leave a lame stale taste in the audience if the writers try to extend the series for too long. But, in terms of screening, the show is intense with Japanese war lore decorating the grips fantastic. The communication between the foreign and the Japanese is well given making the story more full of flavor with a entertaining edge rather than a busted language barrier. The tension between the characters is surreal which gives the audience a sense that the story is actually happening rather than a scripted play. If your into the culture of the samurai or Japanese war cultural history, this is a must watch. I hope season two is just as gripping.	enjoy watch show episode episode know need season two show watch fear story could burn leave lame stale taste audience writer try extend series long term screen show intense japanese war lore decorate grip fantastic communication foreign japanese well give make story full flavor entertain edge rather bust language barrier tension character surreal give audience sense story actually happen rather script play culture samurai japanese war cultural history must watch hope season two grip
0	GoT used to be the show I couldn't wait for but now i find it stale, repetitive and the story just isn't moving forward since the end of season three. Gratuitous violence doesn't bother me if the violence portrayed is integral to the story or helping to move it forward but now its just shock and awe meant to appeal to the simple minded. Season 5 droned on for 7 damn episodes of nothing really happening other than rape, attempted rape, watching a small girl scrub a floor till she goes blind, barbequing another small girl, more small girls get tortured by a pedophile in a brothel and the queen is forced to walk naked through the streets (wow, martin and/or the show writers must really hate women). I get that the writers want to have intrigue and develop the political story but they squeezed all the action into the last three episodes and then it was so predictable, Stanis dies, Jon snow dies (everybody likes him so of course he has to die), Jamies daughter would die, Kalesi's flying fire chicken would save her and despite it all the story has barely moved anywhere in five seasons.GoT is one of the highest production value shows ever made without a doubt but if HBO seems intent on relying way too much on a set recipe of shock and awe, naked people, over the top violent situations (not necessarily violent scenes) and making the audience guess which key characters are going to die instead of an actual progressive story that people can remember from season to season I'm gonna tune out just from pure boredom.Actually I think I'm done with this crap show, I won't support shows written by pedophiles. Seriously anybody who writes that much sadistic sex and bad things on women into a story should be checked up on by the police. Red flag anybody? Ramsey Bolton should peel the skin off the parents of the child actors for their greed to allow their kids to participate in such scenes. I know they're actors and it's a TV show but they are also children! For Christ sake HBO, pushing the envelope doesn't mean abandoning the last vestiges of human morality for the sake of ratings.	get use show wait find stale repetitive story move forward since end season three gratuitous violence bother violence portray integral story help move forward shock awe mean appeal simple mind season drone damn episode nothing really happen rape attempt rape watch small girl scrub floor till go blind barbeque another small girl small girl get torture pedophile brothel queen force walk naked street wow martin show writer must really hate woman get writer want intrigue develop political story squeeze action last three episode predictable stanis die jon snow die everybody like course die jamie daughter would die kalesi fly fire chicken would save despite story barely move anywhere five season get one high production value show ever make without doubt hbo seem intent rely way much set recipe shock awe naked people top violent situation necessarily violent scene make audience guess key character go die instead actual progressive story people remember season season go to tune pure boredom actually think do crap show support show write pedophile seriously anybody write much sadistic sex bad thing woman story check police red flag anybody ramsey bolton peel skin parent child actor greed allow kid participate scene know actor tv show also children christ sake hbo push envelope mean abandon last vestige human morality sake rat

1	"This series is both dark & compelling. The acting is absolutely spot on & I really loved Jessica Gunning (Martha) for her protrayal of his deranged stalker. There are also some gaping holes in the story, & unanswered questions which I wont go into as this will make the review far to long. What it does show is the super low level of police complacency when they failed to act when he first reported his stalker. Anyway back to the series. The first 3 episodes are stunning, but I felt it lost it's way somewhere in the middle. Donny's monolouge from episode 6 was good but far too long. Also this is supposed to be taken from a real life viral monolouge he did which is now nowhere to be found on the internet. The acting is terrific, but creepy. Almost verging on horror movie ""creepy"" but this is keeping with the story. Also this is quite depressing & perhaps not something you should watch if your feeling down. The main character is supposed to be a comedian, but there is little to no comedy in this, however if you are in the right frame of mind ""Reindeer"" could be a really enjoyable show. As for me I am on the fence with this one. I loved the acting, pace & even the story, but it was a little too depressing for my tastes."	series dark compel act absolutely spot really love jessica gun martha protrayal derange stalker also gap hole story unanswered question will not go make review far long show super low level police complacency fail act first report stalker anyway back series first episode stun feel lose way somewhere middle donny monolouge episode good far long also suppose take real life viral monolouge nowhere find internet act terrific creepy almost verge horror movie creepy keep story also quite depress perhaps something watch feel main character suppose comedian little comedy however right frame mind reindeer could really enjoyable show fence one love act pace even story little depress taste
2	The series began with five people who walked into a room that would change their course of life and it started with them being surgical interns and how they grew into great doctors(oh the show is a medical drama).It is a critically acclaimed show for its specialty in playing an orchestra in people's emotion and being really good at it.There are lot of other shows that explains the perspective of the bad guy or the perspective of the good guy saving the day but this show is different in its core.They tell the story in terms of emotions caused by others to the main characters and how would they react to those actions caused by others. Emotions,a powerful word.Basically humans have four emotions which they display when something significant happens to them or to someone around them.These emotions leaves a lasting effect on them.I can personally vouch for them as can you with the things that has happened to you.So it may look simple or feel simple but this show makes it a point to prove how emotions are important and how different people handle them differently.paul96.org/GREY'S ANATOMY-The Emotional Orchestrapaul96.org/MEREDITH GREY-A Sacrificial Surgeonpaul96.org/DEREK SHEPARD-The Magnificent Mcdreamypaul96.org/CRISTINA YANG-The Confident Chickpaul96.org/ALEX KAREV-A Robust Individualpaul96.org/MIRANDA BAILEY-A Meticulous Mentorpaul96.org/GREY'S ANATOMY-Other Characterspaul96.org/GREY'S ANATOMY-The Best Episodes	series begin five people walk room would change course life start surgical intern grow great doctor oh show medical drama critically acclaim show specialty play orchestra people emotion really good lot show explain perspective bad guy perspective good guy save day show different core tell story term emotion cause other main character would react action cause other emotion powerful word basically human four emotion display something significant happen someone around emotion leave last effect personally vouch thing happen may look simple feel simple show make point prove emotion important different people handle differently paul org grey anatomy emotional orchestrapaul org meredith grey sacrificial surgeonpaul org derek shepard magnificent mcdreamypaul org cristina yang confident chickpaul org alex karev robust individualpaul org miranda bailey meticulous mentorpaul org grey anatomy characterspaul org grey anatomy good episode

0	"If they really wanted to do these episodes, they could have done their own original ones instead of ruining my favorite book.I just talk about one thing: why the characterization of Ye is so SIMPLE, FLAT, AND STEREOTYPED! A female scientist who was supposed to be rational appeared irritable, emotionally exposed, and unrestrained in TV drama. What is touching is that Ye has not given up the ability to love her lover despite all the blows, and she still hopes that human beings can get better. She wanted to light a bonfire of civilization, but in the end it got out of control.

But (a enormous BUT) the final season is an insult, not only for the story (that GRRM has not finished) but to the spectators, tv entertainment and also to the characters itself. Don't see it. Is not worth the time. If you don't believe me, just read the final seasons comments.Breaking Bad is still the best serie ever.	story start great loyal book enormous final season insult story grrm finish spectators tv entertainment also character see worth time believe read final season comment break bad still well serie ever

This makes it very difficult to keep the characters straight as you watch the show.Second, the show is too much about their personal lives and not enough about police work - it plays more like a soap opera than a police drama.Finally, the back ground music is annoying. I realize there has to be a musical score in television and movies, but it is not necessary to vocals in the background when the audience is trying to listen to dialogue.	start cast young lady officer look alike make difficult keep character straight watch show second show much personal live enough police work play like soap opera police drama finally back grind music annoy realize musical score television movie necessary vocal background audience try listen dialogue
1	I'm not 100% sure which season it was, either 14 or 15, Shonda stepped down as the shows director. It's noticeable in the show because it's the moment when it slowly starts to decline into woke nonsense before it inevitably starts diving into the shallow end of a woke pool head first.I loved this show.

0	There couldn't be a more gaping hole between the writing of the show in the early seasons vs after the show writers had to do their job when running out of source material from the book. This show was the highlight of my week before season 7, and up until that point my excitement already began to fade as the show started catering to fan service, subverting plot expectations for no other purpose than just that, and making events that shouldn't be possible, possible, and expecting us not to notice. Themes, foreshadowing, and plot setups that were planted for years are thrown out the window. What made the show so great is now gone as the final season wraps up in one fell swoop of disappointment.	gap hole write show early season vs show writer job run source material book show highlight week season point excitement already begin fade show start cater fan service subvert plot expectation purpose make event possible possible expect we notice theme foreshadow plot setup plant year throw window make show great go final season wrap one fall swoop disappointment
2	I am admiring the serie so much due to its captivating story and good acting of Japanese actors.The serie depicts a nice historical decade of international expansion governed by Portugal and Spain , as well as their conflict with Great Britain to master the lands and divide them.The hero of the serie acted talently to show the character potential and inteligence to save his life and the Japanese kingdom. He adapted the Japanese political rules and traditions cleverly.The sences were fascinating and the cast was chosen wisely and reflects the Japanese culture. The custumes as well were designed perfectly and the colors used described the Japanese culture, traditions and it showed each character rank in the society.	admire serie much due captivate story good act japanese actor serie depict nice historical decade international expansion govern portugal spain well conflict great britain master land divide hero serie act talently show character potential inteligence save life japanese kingdom adapt japanese political rule tradition cleverly sence fascinate cast choose wisely reflect japanese culture custume well design perfectly color use describe japanese culture tradition show character rank society

Of course, he's a liberal so guns are bad, killing terrorist is bad, one of the seven main characters has to have jazz hands with a few more introduced every show. Overall a good show when it can get away from that agenda. The storylines are believable. The characters are well developed. They should do more jokes about FIREFLY.

1	I had no idea this series was based on some books, and actually didn't find that out until reading some reviews here after I had finished all eight episodes (I typically will watch a show/series, formulate my opinion, and then read reviews to see how my thinking stacks up).The show started pretty slow, but still kept my interest to continue watching. For the first three episodes the writing was pretty tight, though it continued to move rather slowly. The next two episodes were pretty poor as the writers got lazy. In addition to introducing some pretty big plot holes, they also decided it was time for some melodrama. By episode six, there was no holding back. The writing got so bad it was almost comical. More melodrama, more and bigger plot holes, and just plain nonsense. This pattern continued until the end of the season, which gave us a finale that did absolutely nothing. It was like they wanted to do ten episodes, but ran out of money after number eight, so the season just ended.	idea series base book actually find read review finish eight episode typically watch show series formulate opinion read review see think stack show start pretty slow still keep interest continue watch first three episode write pretty tight though continue move rather slowly next two episode pretty poor writer get lazy addition introduce pretty big plot hole also decide time melodrama episode six hold back write get bad almost comical melodrama big plot hole plain nonsense pattern continue end season give we finale absolutely nothing like want ten episode run money number eight season end
1	This started out great and Nathan Fillion is always pretty great. However, the realism is awful even by Hollywood standards. I watched 2 seasons and it was really laughable how every single episode had the rookies be involved in massive shooutouts and huge cases. Also, every bad guy has an automatic weapon and never hits anything or anyone.Then there's the normal Hollywood craziness with bullet proof car doors etc. And the fact that your every day patrol officers do the things that in real life specialized units and SWAT would handle.Great idea, but the execution is lacking. What started out as a pretty unique show quickly turned into yet another regular cop show.	start great nathan fillion always pretty great however realism awful even hollywood standard watch season really laughable every single episode rookie involve massive shooutouts huge case also every bad guy automatic weapon never hit anything anyone normal hollywood craziness bullet proof car door etc fact every day patrol officer thing real life specialize unit swat would handle great idea execution lack start pretty unique show quickly turn yet another regular cop show

Toranaga sacrifices all his friends for no reason for a ""secret plan"" that never even gets executed. There is NO final battle, you get a 15 sec dream sequence where Toranaga fantasizes about how he would win a fake battle that has not even been fought. And Blackthorne, Toranaga only kept him alive because... HE MADE HIM LAUGH. The entire series has about 30 seconds of collective action, not including the pointless ritual suicides. On top of everything, the entire show is shot on one set, if it was Japan, there was no need for them to even go. The same could have been accomplished on a sound stage. A few horrible overhead CGI shots do not make up for this.

2	I binged this in one sitting, it is gripping from start to finish. I saw reviews saying it was a tough watch, but I didn't find it as tough as others said. It was indeed uncomfortable at times, but having knowledge of how survivors of sexual assault act, I think I was better prepared than most.Which brings me to the point of why this was such a good series. Survivors of sexual assault are not 'perfect victims'. No-one is a perfect victim/survivor like the media and the court system would have us all believe. Most survivors have a past that includes drugs, drinking too much, a fight or two, or something else. This is how perpetrators get off charges in court - the defence finds a typical human flaw/mistake in the survivors past and manipulates that mistake to have the court and media believe it was deserved, or they lied. Another tactic is to claim they exaggerated because they went back to their abuser time and time again. The reality of course, is that trauma impacts how the brain processes and makes sense of events. In sexual assault or domestic abuse, in order to make sense of the incident, survivors often return so that they can tell themselves if they chose to return, they are not victims. They can even convince themselves they consented, or it was their fault. Others convince themselves it didn't happen. This can be a way to protect themselves mentally, however it ends up with a cycle of self-destruct. They rarely act in a logical manner. Most importantly, other abusers can spot survivors a mile away, and this results in them being targets of multiple abusers in their lifetime.Baby Reindeer shows this pattern in such a raw and unapologetic way. I cannot commend Richard Gadd enough for being so honest about it. When his stalker 'Martha' meets him, he has already been sexually assaulted, and is dealing with the mental load of that. She clearly had a routine of testing out her next targets by pretending to cry and see how people react. 'Donny' (Richard) reacts in a way that only a survivor would - he kept feeling sorry for her and falling for her manipulations until he finally cracks and tries to set her up. Of course, this was her plan all along, and she records him and uses it to get the police of her back. This is a classic narcissist tactic. Domestic abusers do the same - they push and push and push, and when the survivor snaps, they record them, call the police, and then claim to be the victim themselves.Many reviews and social media posts have discussed how Donny is self-absorbed and stupid for going back to the guy who sexually assaulted him, and for contacting his stalker. Such people have clearly led a life in which they have had no experience of being targeted by a stalker or a rapist (or knowing someone who has), and their lack of understanding and compassion is not only disappointing, but ill-informed. I hope they live out the rest of their lives without experiencing it first-hand, but I will say, if you have no experience in such matters, keep the judgements to yourself and read the wealth of research conducted on this subject in the fields of Criminology and Psychology. 'Donny' is not atypical in his actions - and probably would have gone for help sooner had there not been so much stigma and incorrect judgments about such abuse in society (the same stigma being perpetrated by those complaining about his behaviour and saying he was stupid). The self-destructive behaviour and self-loathing that comes with sexual assault cannot be underestimated, and people need to have more compassion and stop perpetuating the 'perfect victim' myth. Society as a whole needs to work harder at reducing the stigma and preconceptions they have of survivors actions while they try and make sense of their trauma.	binge one sit grip start finish see review say tough watch find tough other say indeed uncomfortable time knowledge survivor sexual assault act think well prepare bring point good series survivor sexual assault perfect victim one perfect victim survivor like media court system would we believe survivor past include drug drink much fight two something else perpetrator get charge court defence find typical human flaw mistake survivor past manipulate mistake court medium believe deserve lie another tactic claim exaggerate go back abuser time time reality course trauma impact brain process make sense event sexual assault domestic abuse order make sense incident survivor often return tell choose return victim even convince consent fault other convince happen way protect mentally however end cycle self destruct rarely act logical manner importantly abuser spot survivor mile away result target multiple abuser lifetime baby reindeer show pattern raw unapologetic way commend richard gadd enough honest stalker martha meet already sexually assault deal mental load clearly routine test next target pretend cry see people react donny richard react way survivor would keep feel sorry fall manipulation finally crack try set course plan along record use get police back classic narcissist tactic domestic abuser push push push survivor snap record call police claim victim many review social medium post discuss donny self absorb stupid go back guy sexually assault contact stalker people clearly lead life experience target stalker rapist know someone lack understand compassion disappoint ill inform hope live rest live without experience first hand say experience matter keep judgement read wealth research conduct subject field criminology psychology donny atypical action probably would go help soon much stigma incorrect judgment abuse society stigma perpetrate complain behaviour say stupid self destructive behaviour self loathe come sexual assault underestimate people need compassion stop perpetuate perfect victim myth society whole need work hard reduce stigma preconception survivor action try make sense trauma
2	The producing team come with a great pedigree but could they have bitten off more than they can chew?Many of the choices they made certainly worked but some of their choices made no sense whatsoever. I've seen plenty of comments about how odd it is that scientists would give up at physics breaking, when new discoveries is exactly what scientists live for. This could have been better explained.I would have liked them to have explored Fermi's Paradox and the Dark Forest themes a bit more, and to explain why the Staircase Project was so important but the second series is well set.The world building was excellent and I was not disappointed by some of the set pieces, particularly the Panama canal incident. That being one of my favourite scenes in the novel.But when all things are said and done, I look forward to season two, however, this is Netflix so let's not get too excited yet!	produce team come great pedigree could bite chew many choice make certainly work choice make sense whatsoever see plenty comment odd scientist would give physics break new discovery exactly scientist live could well explain would like explore fermi paradox dark forest theme bite explain staircase project important second series well set world build excellent disappoint set piece particularly panama canal incident one favourite scene novel thing say do look forward season two however netflix let get excite yet

Her naivete is unbelievable yet the exposure to the outside causes her to grow. Goggins plays a wild west cowboy ghoul bounty hunter but is he dead or what? This actor really brings star quality in all he does sort of like Jack Nickonson. Despite the usual gory blood baths, with poor character development. The world of a nuclear disaster makes for iinteresting material. Lucy the protagonist blithely just happens to walk into a town and finds trouble she does not understand. At every turn aome one rescues her. A weird choice of 50's technology is featured. Metal armored suits , all kinds of mercenaries , and hidden orders battle to gain supremecy. The soundtrack is horrible takes away from the films ambiance. It gets better it grows on you.

I think anyone (no matter who you voted for) can agree that writers brought it a little too far.Have you ever met a police officer who thought their job was easy? Especially with this blm mess going on? No.These people put THEIR LIVES on the line for you. I just really hope Nathan Fillon finds himself in a situation where he needs cops, and either they don't come, or he realizes that this whole thing is idiotic, and honestly childish.I mean come on. If you sit around all day, writing a show, don't you think you'd at least thank someone that risks their life? Someone who is the reason you can even write your show in peace?If I really wanted to learn about this stuff, don't you think I'd be watching the news, and not a cop (the people these blm supporters hate) show? Probably.If you haven't watched the third season yet, I would recommend skipping it.I just really hope they don't make season 4 anything like the third.	love first two season third way think anyone matter vote agree writer bring little far ever meet police officer think job easy especially blm mess go people put live line really hope nathan fillon find situation need cop either come realize whole thing idiotic honestly childish mean come sit around day write show think least thank someone risk life someone reason even write show peace really want learn stuff think watch news cop people blm supporter hate show probably watch third season yet would recommend skip really hope make season anything like third
0	"While the series is supposed to focus on the life of surgical interns/residents in a teaching hospital, about half of the story line for each episode emphasizes promiscuous sexual encounters among the various interns/residents and attending staff members. For example, Meredith Grey and Derek Shepherd had an affair before finally getting married; Lexie has affairs with Mark Sloan, who in turn has affairs with just about every female working at Seattle Grace Hospital, including Callie Torres, a bisexual. Izzie had an affair with Karev before the two were married, then she left him and sought a divorce. Cristina Yang was Burke's live-in girlfriend and almost married him, then after he left, she took up ""residence"" with Owen Hunt as his paramour. And then there's homosexuality: Callie Torres first had a lesbian relationship with Erica Hahn, then with Arizona Robbins, and in one episode, a female patient manifested erotic pleasure when Torres held her hand. The series depicts an underlying atmosphere of decadence and depravity, which undoubtedly contributes to ""high"" ratings and reviews."	series suppose focus life surgical intern resident teach hospital half story line episode emphasize promiscuous sexual encounter among various intern resident attend staff member example meredith grey derek shepherd affair finally get marry lexie affairs mark sloan turn affair every female work seattle grace hospital include callie torre bisexual izzie affair karev two marry leave seek divorce cristina yang burke live girlfriend almost marry leave take residence owen hunt paramour homosexuality callie torre first lesbian relationship erica hahn arizona robbin one episode female patient manifest erotic pleasure torre hold hand series depict underlie atmosphere decadence depravity undoubtedly contribute high rat review
1	The series has many characteristics of a good series. The new and creative story is the most important feature of the series. Scientifically, creative ideas can be seen in the series. Of course, the series has some weaknesses, one of which is the way to communicate with space aliens, and another problem is the technology attributed to space aliens, which is not believable for the viewer. There is also a lack of excitement in the last three episodes of the series, which is followed by a certain excitements and ends without results and without stimulating the viewer to wait for the next seasons.	series many characteristic good series new creative story important feature series scientifically creative idea see series course series weaknesse one way communicate space alien another problem technology attribute space alien believable viewer also lack excitement last three episode series follow certain excitement end without result without stimulate view wait next season
1	The beginning season were amazing!! Great actors with interesting storylines, it had the perfect amount of humor and heart to go along with the brutal cases brought into the hospital. But then it started to lose it's heart, characters became extremely annoying, and the personal issues of the characters became exhausting as they never seemed to change. Grey's Anatomy had a great cast to start with, then they took those characters and slowly made them unbearable to stand. While eventually getting rid of some of the best actors on the show to replace them with people who you will not be able to tolerate for very long. I wish this show would focus more on the medicine aspect and less on the personal lives of the doctors. It would be nice if they would clean up the cast and get better actors with better storylines or just end the show! 15 seasons is a bit much.	begin season amaze great actor interest storyline perfect amount humor heart go along brutal case bring hospital start lose heart character become extremely annoy personal issue character become exhaust never seem change grey anatomy great cast start take character slowly make unbearable stand eventually get rid good actor show replace people able tolerate long wish show would focus medicine aspect less personal live doctor would nice would clean cast get well actor well storyline end show season bite much
2	This is more like 10 short movies rather than a television series. Beautifully filmed in some stunning scenery. Japan is a very beautiful country on the small or big screen.I can vaguely remember the original television series when I was growing up but I can't recall if it was actually any good. This version of the same book is a bit of a slow burner and yes there are subtitles. Lots of subtitles. I guess 90% of the dialogue is Japanese which is great for and obviously authentic but be warned you will be reading quite a lot of dialogue.No plot spoilers here so you'll just have to go and watch it for yourself. If you like films like The Last Samurai or The Seven Samurai then I think you'll love this. Epic storytelling for the small screen at its very best.	like short movie rather television series beautifully film stun scenery japan beautiful country small big screen vaguely remember original television series grow recall actually good version book bite slow burner yes subtitle lot subtitle guess dialogue japanese great obviously authentic warn read quite lot dialogue plot spoiler go watch like film like last samurai seven samurai think love epic storytelle small screen good

2	As a preface, I haven't read the books, but I have watched the full Chinese series.I was reluctant to watch this version, but am glad I did. I thought this was, overall, a pretty decent adaptation. Not perfect by any means, but then neither is the Chinese version. I think the Chinese version does a great job of explaining the science and the reasoning behind the decisions better, but it lacks any real sense of dread and the present-day characters seemed a little bland. The US version also lacks that sense of dread, and also cuts out a lot of the explanation for certain decisions, but it does (in my opinion) have more rounded present-day characters, even though they are a little bit 'cookie-cutter'. This version also cuts out a lot of the 60s/70s back story , which I thought was one of the more interesting parts of the Chinese show, and helped lend weight to the main characters motivations.This version moves at a much faster pace than the Chinese version, which in some ways is good, but I think they blew the whole plotline too early. I would like to have seen more focus on the mental trauma caused by the slow realization of what was happening. A director like M. Night Shymalan who is very skilled at building dread would have been perfect for this project. I would also have liked to see a stronger focus on international co-operation and reaction to the events. It seems the whole world is ok with the UK making all the calls.All in all it kept me hooked enough to binge watch. I look forward to the second season.	preface read book watch full chinese series reluctant watch version glad think overall pretty decent adaptation perfect mean neither chinese version think chinese version great job explain science reason behind decision well lack real sense dread present day character seem little bland we version also lack sense dread also cut lot explanation certain decision opinion round present day character even though little bite cookie cutter version also cut lot back story think one interest part chinese show help lend weight main character motivation version move much fast pace chinese version way good think blow whole plotline early would like see focus mental trauma cause slow realization happen director like night shymalan skilled build dread would perfect project would also like see strong focus international co operation reaction event seem whole world ok uk make call keep hook enough binge watch look forward second season

Every sub story is now about social injustice. Can we just have an entertaining show. It was well written series before the BLM movement this summer. But now I guess the writers feel the need to put his story line in every sub story in every episode. Yes I agree there is much social injustice, but we don't need to have this pushed on us every time we want to just watch TV. I live here in LA the home of Hollywood. I am a true So Cal native, so I understand but give me a break. We hear what you are saying but can you do a better job of writing and not make the message and agenda you are pushing so obvious?

1	I know about Fallout, as I've picked up on it through cultural exposure, but never directly.This show makes me feel like I should at least play New Vegas! Because, while the visuals and execution are decent-to-good, it does a poor job at making me care about anything that's going on. From charmless actors with boring and unlikeable characters, horrible pacing and plenty of empty drawn-out moments... to dull writing, dialogues and interactions. No particular element grabbed my attention, and I felt finishing this show was a chore I had to get through.I'm saddened at the delivery of what seemed like a promising new show to watch.. but it reminds me a lot of all the problems I had with the later Westworld seasons, where nothing was particularly interesting.	know fallout pick cultural exposure never directly show make feel like least play new vegas visual execution decent good poor job make care anything go charmless actor bear unlikeable character horrible pace plenty empty draw moment dull write dialogue interaction particular element grab attention feel finish show chore get sadden delivery seem like promise new show watch remind lot problem later westworld season nothing particularly interest

Complaining that auggie is too good looking to be a top scientist is borderline sexist and plain stupid. Even if they are far feom the majority you meet many young women in science university studies and they can be stunning or ugly just like in any other curriculum. Choosing a part western cast for an international oriented big budget TV show makes perfect sense, recently there not a single production without an Asian and an Indian to please local audiences for the same reasons... No I didn't liked it because it's boring and it tells a story that could have been told in one book or two but clearly someone wanted to milk the cash cows again.	book like reviewer like useless love triangle cast complain auggie good look top scientist borderline sexist plain stupid even far feom majority meet many young woman science university study stun ugly like curriculum choose part western cast international orient big budget tv show make perfect sense recently single production without asian indian please local audience reason like bore tell story could tell one book two clearly someone want milk cash cow
1	"The series is based on a book. I remember the book was hailed as a.great accomplishment when it appeared and I put it on my to read list. However, after looking at reviews I decided to postpone it indefinitely. Needless to say, series in Netflix is an opportunity to find out what the fuzz was all about. It begins well and I understand how the opening sequences set in China during cultural revolution might be eye opening. I am not even sure whether any of that is even taught at schools. Maybe history classes are all on intersectionality? Who knows. In any case, from there the series deteriorates rapidly. We encounter supposedly top scientists of Great Britain if not the world. I do not know whether dialogues were lifted from the book or were created for TV, but I can assure creators of the series that high IQ people do not talk like teenagers strolling through the mall in buggy pants and do not have emotional problems lifted from Friends. I also hate to break it to TC ""creators"", but smoking weed is not top pastime at CERN. The reason is prosaic, it is rather difficult for a stoned person to engage in modern physics. I suspect that operating a lift fork would be a challenge, but operating a cyclotron certainly is.At this point I actually stopped watching, but after few days I decided to ignore physicists cum deadheads licencia poetica and continue. That was a mistake. It became quite obvious that the whole story was conceived by teenagers and caters to younger viewers who still find the world of computer games more engaging than the actual world. Why highly advance alien civilization would use VR game to communicate information about their native world that could have been communicated within a brief paragraph? Note they are so advanced they have no problem typing in Chinese or Cyrillic. They can wrap half of the Universe into a single proton but their invasion plan is to hire Manson Family.

This show started out so good, well developed characters, heart wrenching storylines... but once the main characters started to leave, the show was over. But Ellen Pompeo continues to drag this show through the battlefield of fallen characters, every natural disaster you can think of, and every hairbrained medical mishaps on this planet and the next.	admittedly stop watch show season feel invest enough time still leave review show start good well develop character heart wrench storyline main character start leave show ellen pompeo continue drag show battlefield fall character every natural disaster think every hairbraine medical mishap planet next
1	I've played Fallout 3, New Vegas and gave up completing Fallout 4, so I'm familiar with the universe, but not a die-hard fan of the franchise.On the whole, I enjoyed the show. It does a great job of presenting the world I know from the video games, capturing the tone, the art style and even some of the humor that made the games such a great experience. There's an atmosphere to the show that is instantly recognizable to any gamer who spent time in the wasteland. Special effects are quite good, and there's a density to the set design and props that makes the world feel more real and lived in.Acting ranges from decent to excellent. Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins stand out, and are able to overcome some fairly campy dialogue to deliver performances that are both memorable and fun to watch.Unfortunately, I feel like the show stumbles with telling a compelling story. There are several instances where the plot develops a little too conveniently. Characters just happen across each other at the exact right time and place for the story to progress, with no explanation given. There are also a couple of writing choices where my suspension of disbelief went right out the window. Most importantly, when I finished episode 8, I still didn't have any idea of what the story was really about. What point were they trying to get across? Why did they make this show in the first place? As with most new media these days, it felt a little like they wanted to make a show around a familiar franchise, and then hired some writers to accomplish that, rather than starting off with a burning desire to tell a Fallout story.All in all, it's an entertaining watch, but it's not a 10 out of 10 experience as many here seem to suggest. If you moderate your expectations story-wise, you'll have a good time with Fallout.	play fallout new vegas give complete fallout familiar universe die hard fan franchise whole enjoy show great job present world know video game capture tone art style even humor make game great experience atmosphere show instantly recognizable gamer spend time wasteland special effect quite good density set design prop make world feel real live act range decent excellent ella purnell walton goggin stand able overcome fairly campy dialogue deliver performance memorable fun watch unfortunately feel like show stumble tell compel story several instance plot develop little conveniently character happen across exact right time place story progress explanation give also couple write choice suspension disbelief go right window importantly finish episode still idea story really point try get across make show first place new medium day feel little like want make show around familiar franchise hire writer accomplish rather start burn desire tell fallout story entertain watch experience many seem suggest moderate expectation story wise good time fallout
0	This was not good. I haven't even seen the talented Mr. Ripley so I am not being influenced. The story, what there is of it, is that a rich playboy won't come home so his rich dad hires some acquaintance of this son to convince him to come home. But said acquaintance is not exactly a nice person. Agree that Andrew Scott is all wrong for this role. He comes off as completely the sketchy person he is. (and the first scene gives away the ending so you have no doubt). Right now he is being pushed by Hollywood so he gets this role even though he isn't right for it. The black and white does nothing to help the story and only screams pretentious (and I think it actually makes Scott look older). But for me the real problem is that there isn't enough story here to make a series. The first two episodes were intensely slow and drawn out. Even hitting the fast forward button a lot I felt like they were really puffing the story out. This is everything wrong with Hollywood today. Take a previously done story, do it wrong, make it longer and cast people you want to push.	good even see talented mr ripley influence story rich playboy come home rich dad hire acquaintance son convince come home say acquaintance exactly nice person agree andrew scott wrong role come completely sketchy person first scene give away end doubt right push hollywood get role even though right black white nothing help story scream pretentious think actually make scott look old real problem enough story make series first two episode intensely slow draw even hit fast forward button lot feel like really puff story everything wrong hollywood today take previously do story wrong make long cast people want push
2	Don't get me wrong, I love the show until season 16. I am also an extremely left leaning European but the lessons in each episode are too in your face. People are not dumb. Not every injury must be tied to some lesson etc. Plus it's extremely hypocritical that they're still celebrating people in the army as if they are heroes when in reality they're just pawns infiltrating countries that literally don't need them there.I'd love to see some episodes go back to the old style of giving life lessons etc.I am not opposed to some wokeness but it needs to be toned down and done in a bit of a smarter way.	get wrong love show season also extremely leave lean european lesson episode face people dumb every injury must tie lesson etc plus extremely hypocritical still celebrate people army hero reality pawn infiltrate country literally need love see episode go back old style give life lesson etc oppose wokeness need tone do bite smart way
2	As a huge fan of the books - I can confidently say I genuinely enjoyed watching this take on the popular Three Body Problem series.If you come in expecting an exact replica of the books, you already have set an unrealistic expectation considering the amount of build up, scientific knowledge, and character development in the first book.They make major changes such as the main character being a woman, while it's a male in the book - with some liberties in other things like pacing and timing.Everyone I know who has NOT read the series has praised their enjoyment of the show. I myself, thoroughly enjoyed their take on book 1 and seriously cannot wait to see The Dark Forest adapted soon. Netflix did a good job with this one!	huge fan book confidently say genuinely enjoy watch take popular three body problem series come expect exact replica book already set unrealistic expectation consider amount build scientific knowledge character development first book make major change main character woman male book libertie thing like pace time everyone know read series praise enjoyment show thoroughly enjoy take book seriously wait see dark forest adapt soon netflix good job one
1	I've watched the original mini-series and have read the book twice. I'm more a fan of the original because it included narration for context. I find myself reading captions at the bottom of the screen instead of enjoying scenery or the actors. I'd re watch this series completely once I get through all episodes. I might even purchase the original with Richard Chamberlain. This review is much longer than it needs to be because there's a six hundred charactor minimum. A feature that is completely useless and unnecessary. So I keep trying and trying but it won't let me submit it. Nope, just tried again but it's not happening.	watch original mini series read book twice fan original include narration context find read caption bottom screen instead enjoy scenery actor watch series completely get episode might even purchase original richard chamberlain review much long need six hundred charactor minimum feature completely useless unnecessary keep try try let submit nope try happen
1	"I got into The Rookie a couple of years late, so I binged Season 1 and Season 2. I liked the show. It's not as good as ""Southland"", but it was a nice, inoffensive, standard LAPD drama, with the charm of Nathan Fillion carrying the show.Oh but then Season 3 hit. The show became a preachy, boring, heavy-handed wokefest. The writers treated every white character, ESPECIALLY Officer Nolan, as racists or idiots. It was a nonstop browbeating for the entire season. And the ratings plummeted.Imagine my surprise when Season 4 started, and there was no more Titus Makin, Jr. In the cast. Imagine my surprise when the entire ""Nolan goes to law school night classes and gets browbeaten about white privilege"" storyline is just gone. Not a mention of it. No, now Nolan wants to be a TO, and not a detective. The first two episodes have been an action movie rescue plan to get Lopez from La Fiera, and a Tricia Helfer as a hottie master thief in tight outfits plotline.The fanbase hated Season 3.

0	"A mildly entertaining story, very loosely based on the book.Choice of limey old England was unfortunate as its a downer for many viewers, doesn't make much sense given UK's current irrelevance, and significantly deviates from the original story. I understand most of the intended audience has a low tolerance to reading subtitles, and having a Chinese cast speak English would have maligned our perpetually maligned auntie, but why go for UK? There's more interesting & relevant Anglophone countries to base it in... even SG would've made more sense.Despite the setting & goofs, the story is still engaging up to around mid-season, by then the mystery is revealed and it becomes a bit of a slog. Acting was occasionally funny, but the characters 1D, tiresome after a while. Actors felt like actors pretending to be scientists without having lived in the role 1st. Relationships between characters also felt forced & unnatural, with only a couple of exceptions.Goofs include the unfolding proton thing, which is essentially magic, and like most magic in stories it suffers from the writer's lack of imagination on how it would be used, and inconsistencies in its stated logic, for example how it reflects a skylit ground after blocking the sky... and if it could reflect/block light at that scale, why not use it to attenuate sunlight back home? Regardless, if these protons could alter vision and computer storage, they could swiftly end the careers of anyone much more effectively & secretly than spooking them with a countdown. Magic + lack of imagination never works, stick with hard sci-fi instead.The show has many references to superstition, including modern ones brought to us via scholarly grift: ""what if columns of my spreadsheet were alternate realities?"" or: ""I can digest your lunch while digesting mine if we entangle them""... I'm surprised they didn't chuck in the ""we're all noodles"" thing, though they did mention how colliders produced 'wrong' results, which are then blamed on a deity - a viciously funny in-joke, but I doubt it was intentional. Other goofs generally reveal the age of the show's creators, like sitting in a car using an SLR camera to surveil someone, or the constant smoking.Vfx was poorly directed: milky lighting, white sky + sunlight, over-comped, weird camera & timing that screamed ""now here's a vfx shot"". The comical slicing scene was especially disappointing given how eerie it could have looked.Don't remember the Music."	mildly entertain story loosely base book choice limey old england unfortunate downer many viewer make much sense give uk current irrelevance significantly deviate original story understand intend audience low tolerance read subtitle chinese cast speak english would malign perpetually malign auntie go uk interest relevant anglophone country base even sg would make sense despite set goof story still engage around mid season mystery reveal become bite slog act occasionally funny character tiresome actor feel like actor pretend scientist without live role st relationship character also feel force unnatural couple exception goof include unfold proton thing essentially magic like magic story suffer writer lack imagination would use inconsistency state logic example reflect skylit grind block sky could reflect block light scale use attenuate sunlight back home regardless proton could alter vision computer storage could swiftly end career anyone much effectively secretly spook countdown magic lack imagination never work stick hard sci fi instead show many reference superstition include modern one bring we via scholarly grift column spreadsheet alternate reality digest lunch digest mine entangle surprise chuck noodle thing though mention collider produce wrong result blame deity viciously funny joke doubt intentional goof generally reveal age show creator like sit car use slr camera surveil someone constant smoke vfx poorly direct milky light white sky sunlight compe weird camera time scream vfx shoot comical slice scene especially disappoint give eerie could look remember music
1	I started watching this show about two years ago and thanks to Netflix I've been able to binge. I enjoyed the series a lot up until season 10. Then it started to get a little old, but still watchable up until season 14.Now it's a total train wreck, the writing is horrible, the characters don't have the same connection as the previous ones and it's a show that focuses mainly on being politically correct and not in a good way. I watched the most recent episode and 2 main characters who were previously in the military and dealt with the horrors of war became so stressed out that their four year old boy wanted to be called a girl so they need to see a therapist to help them come to terms with it. 🤷‍♀️I ended up giving it a 6/10 because of the first half.	start watch show two year ago thank netflix able binge enjoy series lot season start get little old still watchable season total train wreck write horrible character connection previous one show focus mainly politically correct good way watch recent episode main character previously military deal horror war become stress four year old boy want call girl need see therapist help come term end give first half
1	"Ok, some parts of this series are excellent. The acting and cinematography are top-tier and deserve all the high ratings. That is really where it stops for me though. The rapist basically gets rewarded for being a scum bag and suffers no consequences for his abhorrent actions. Donny puts Martha in jail for stalking and harassment (due to being mentally ill) but then he goes back to the rapist(who is actually evil) and agrees to work for him again?? What exactly is the message here? The part I found the most meaning in is that after being raped Donny struggles with his sexuality and I feel the show portrayed what is probably a common thing for men who have been sexually assaulted in a heartbreaking, yet realistic way. I also really liked the scene where he tells his parents about the abuse and his father asks ""Would you think of me, as less of a man?"" Teri is so lovable, and it was easy to understand why Donny fell head over heels.What I really don't understand after finding out this show is based on the writer's real experiences is what did he intend for us to learn from this series? That after you are abused you will find massive success by going back to your abuser? That if you find yourself being stalked you should see it as a good thing because somebody finally loves you? After finishing the series I just feel empty, besides a strong dislike of the person who Donny is based on."	ok part series excellent act cinematography top tier deserve high rat really stop though rapist basically get reward scum bag suffer consequence abhorrent action donny put martha jail stalk harassment due mentally ill go back rapist actually evil agree work exactly message part find mean rap donny struggle sexuality feel show portray probably common thing man sexually assault heartbreaking yet realistic way also really like scene tell parent abuse father ask would think less man teri lovable easy understand donny fall head heel really understand find show base writer real experience intend we learn series abuse find massive success go back abuser find stalk see good thing somebody finally love finish series feel empty besides strong dislike person donny base

1	One of the best TV-series of all time turned to one of the worst by bad writing in the last 2-3 seasons, the same time when the series surpassed the books.A such complex tree of character storyline can't end in any other way than disaster if you rush the end. And that's what happens to this show. It is like the series went for a nice and slow walk in terms of tempo the first 5-6 seasons and then turned it to a 100 meter sprint. Character development down the drain.I do recommend watching with a warning of disappointment. The first seasons are like nothing else after all.	one good tv series time turn one bad bad write last season time series surpass book complex tree character storyline end way disaster rush end happen show like series go nice slow walk term tempo first season turn meter sprint character development drain recommend watch warn disappointment first season like nothing else
1	"So after episode 4 this is my final review:This Shogun adaption just feels wrong, way too often. Diverting from the source and adapting a story to a modern view can be a good thing, if done right. In this case: It's not done right. And you almost get the impression, that all the good stuff was cut after filming.Switching from muskets training for the regiment to cannons? An ambush with cannons? The Napoleonic Wars? Come on. Cannons in feudal Japan wouldn't be possible, they had virtually no roads and no way to use them in land wars. But hey, it looks cool, so why not?And remember in the book, Blackthorne being outraged after the offer to ""pillow"" with a man? Guess what: That's gone in the FX Adaption. Blackthorne now merely shakes his head and gives a short remark. That's all.Honestly, Disney and FX are going way too far in their censorship of the story. Yeah, the story that takes place at the end of the 16th century. By that time, there wasn't anything like political correctness in the teachings of the Pope.Or maybe that's what the makers of the show mean, when they talk about a modern adaption of the book. I'm sure, James Clavell would die of shame if he wasn't already dead.Shogun by James Clavell isn't a book easily adapted as an TV-Show, and FX did an overall good job. The visuals are stunning, the music is good enough, and the actors aren't bad at all. Sadly, the actors in some key roles could do a lot better, though. Anna Sawai isn't really a good fit for Mariko, if you imagine the well refined woman you read about in the book. But that's something one can live with.The real problem is the kind of loveless adaption of the minor details from the book. Blackthorne walking by the prisoners being crucified or how dehumanizing being pissed on really is for Japanese people - all those important cultural clues are missing in the show.It's a good show, don't get me wrong, but it could be a lot better. So, if you haven't read the book or have never seen the '80s Miniseries, I guess you won't be disappointed."	episode final review shogun adaption feel wrong way often divert source adapt story modern view good thing do right case do right almost get impression good stuff cut film switch musket train regiment cannon ambush cannon napoleonic war come cannon feudal japan possible virtually road way use land war hey look cool remember book blackthorne outrage offer pillow man guess go fx adaption blackthorne merely shake head give short remark honestly disney fx go way far censorship story yeah story take place end th century time anything like political correctness teach pope maybe maker show mean talk modern adaption book sure jam clavell would die shame already dead shogun jam clavell book easily adapt tv show fx overall good job visual stun music good enough actor bad sadly actor key role could lot well though anna sawai really good fit mariko imagine well refine woman read book something one live real problem kind loveless adaption minor detail book blackthorne walk prisoner crucify dehumanize piss really japanese people important cultural clue miss show good show get wrong could lot well read book never see miniserie guess disappoint
1	I'd give it 10 stars for the first maybe 10 seasons. This show used to have so much heart. I cried every episode! Great characters and character development. The stories they told about all of the patients added an emotional impact with every episode along with the main casts storylines. Now the patients stories and main characters storylines feel like fluff. Once all the main cast was gone it was all down hill from there. It's sad this is one of my favorite shows. I still rewatch it but I have to stop around season 10 because it becomes unbearable to watch. It doesn't have the same heart that it used to.	give star first maybe season show use much heart cry every episode great character character development story tell patient add emotional impact every episode along main cast storyline patient story main character storyline feel like fluff main cast go hill sad one favorite show still rewatch stop around season become unbearable watch heart use

0	The first couple episodes are interesting, the more the show goes on the more boring it becomes. I had to fast forward almost every dialogue through episodes 5-7, at least half the screentime in these episodes was dedicated to drama between Blackthorne and Mariko which is the most dull and tiresome part of the whole film.The whole political power struggle can be interesting but sadly it's not flashed out enough, and then again, the show just tumbles down into weird family drama instead of continuing with the scheming councilours and profit-seeking Portugese. Even though the scheming we are shown also has some flaws, some events/plot twists don't make sense and even made me laugh.There is VERY little action in the show, almost none of it. There is still hope for the episodes to come, but as for episodes 1-7 there is basically 1-2 fighting scenes... in a show about feudal Japan and the samurai.As for the technical part, the costumes, scenery, athmosphere and VFX overall are good. Almost all dialogues are on Japanese with English subtitles, and it can be a little off-putting after a while, even though it is somewhat understandable because we are shown a dispute between the Western European and Japanese cultures.The acting in the film is decent, not horrible but not a masterpiece either.Overall, the show (so far) is mediocre at best, and feels like a lot of wasted potential. There are some cool scenes, ideas and characters, but it is definitely not the 10/10 show as many proclaim.	first couple episode interest show go bore become fast forward almost every dialogue episode least half screentime episode dedicate drama blackthorne mariko dull tiresome part whole film whole political power struggle interest sadly flash enough show tumble weird family drama instead continue scheme councilour profit seek portugese even though scheme show also flaw event plot twist make sense even make laugh little action show almost none still hope episode come episode basically fight scene show feudal japan samurai technical part costume scenery athmosphere vfx overall good almost dialogue japanese english subtitle little put even though somewhat understandable show dispute western european japanese culture act film decent horrible masterpiece either overall show far mediocre good feel like lot waste potential cool scene idea character definitely show many proclaim
0	I was invited to watch it with a whole advertisement on social networks. But after watching the first three episodes, I decided not to continue watching it. Because I feel that the children who have suffered for ten years voted for it out of excitement, not those who have been following the cinema for several years. All this advertising and noise for a scenario similar to the third-rate Korean series (jumong) with special effects that should not be at the level of a score above 9, but these special effects are fair in the range of a score of 6. The black army in the movie is very weak and amateur. I hope you will not be fooled by the score without technical support like me. The actual score of this series is 6.	invite watch whole advertisement social network watch first three episode decide continue watch feel child suffer ten year vote excitement follow cinema several year advertise noise scenario similar third rate korean series jumong special effect level score special effect fair range score black army movie weak amateur hope fool score without technical support like actual score series

1	Yes, I haven't played the game. I've heard of it, but I went into this completely blind. I had no background context and most definitely did not get any jabs to the game, but I did enjoy it. I found it was really well-paced, it didn't rush into anything and allowed me to understand the plot. Which I would've gotten almost instantly if I knew the lore of the game. I thought the costume design was great, and so was the set design. However, I found the dialogue between Lucy and Max extremely awkward and their romance was tedious, I don't think they had much of a spark at all.

0	We started out really liking the premise and intrigue even though at first the show seemed like a Recycler at times, but the intrigue kept building for a few episodes and of course the cast was more than just a magnet for viewers, from Jonathan Pryce and Rosalind Chao to Benedict Wong and John Bradley. Sighh, unfortunately the premise is mired in some major plot flaws and by the end of the first season, with the finale, we find 3 Body Problem has some serious story telling problems, specific to the science fiction genre. Clearly many of you found it incredibly good and we invite you to challenge our full-blown review which identifies specific and major structural issues with this series.

0	As stated in the title, the first couple of seasons were amazing. They had the world watching every year and it was a phenomena that won't see again for decades. Not since Friends have we seen a show capture so much attention.But the show writers decided to squander all their hard work and good will by trying to wrap everything up within one season that should have been done over at least 3 so they could go to Hollywood and cash in by directing a Star Wars film. The karma came back around and they are now hated and never got their Star Wars film. Lol.So while the journey is fun, the ending is so truly awful that there's no point in wasting that many hours of your life. There's no point investing that much of your own life in to something you know will end so badly.	state title first couple season amaze world watch every year phenomenon see decade since friend see show capture much attention show writer decide squander hard work good try wrap everything within one season do least could go hollywood cash direct star war film karma come back around hat never get star war film lol journey fun end truly awful point waste many hour life point invest much life something know end badly
0	I kept hearing how good this was. So I was drawn in and watched it. It was good in part but, an alien invasion series with no immediate prospect of aliens invading was really the big twist. Once it was revealed the alien fleet was 400 years away it really took the edge off the suspense. That freed up time for hours of navel gazing by the main characters. Most significant of which was the angst following the destruction of the alien's acolyte's converted freighter. Since the plan must have been well discussed you would have thought the scientist would have realised what would happen if you put a giant super egg slicer in the Panama canal and ran a ship full of people through it.Add to that the made for tv level sfx and the only thing missing was an after the credits rendition of never gonna give you up the legendary meme for internet trolling.	keep hear good draw watch good part alien invasion series immediate prospect alien invade really big twist reveal alien fleet year away really take edge suspense free time hour navel gaze main character significant angst follow destruction alien acolyte convert freighter since plan must well discuss would think scientist would realise would happen put giant super egg slicer panama canal run ship full people add make tv level sfx thing miss credit rendition never go to give legendary meme internet troll
2	I truly loved season 1-17. I am surprised at how much i have enjoyed a show and for 17 seasons even! After that, my favourite characters were mostly gone. Kepner, Calliope, Deluca, and more. The show keeps killing characters before becoming seniors (Edwards and Deluca) all of whom i would've loved to see grow. They kept ones like Wilson and Maggie??? Both the very annoying. With meredith gone and this new batch of residents it'll be reeeeeeeally bad. Hate these new baby residents. We have to watch another set of characters grow again from the beginning?? Making the same mistKes as the 2/3 sets of residents before them? No thank you.Also why the hell have Jo and Linc been in this unidentified and untouched love thingie for 3 seasons? The writers forget they exist and hint at their attraction for 5 minutes every episode.	truly love season surprise much enjoy show season even favourite character mostly go kepner calliope deluca show keep kill character become senior edwards deluca would love see grow keep one like wilson maggie annoy meredith go new batch resident reeeeeeeally bad hate new baby resident watch another set character grow begin make mistke set resident thank also hell jo linc unidentified untouched love thingie season writer forget exist hint attraction minute every episode
0	I enjoy the show well enough at times. I like the characters well enough, even if they are pretty much the same thing you've seen a thousand times over. That's the kind of thing that can be improved with more time to build on them.That said, the writing is pretty atrocious. The writers clearly don't care about A) how police work actually works and B) how the real world actually works. I'll admit I'm far from an expert on the former (although there's still so much that I know is wrong). That said, I do know that someone won't be cleared for active duty within weeks of being shot in the chest (without a vest). I know that someone will not be walking around perfectly fine weeks after being shot in the face. I know that cops don't just walk into situations without making sure they have back up, especially when that leads to them brushing with death on a seemingly weekly basis. I know that Internal Affairs won't actually break the law to try to trip up cops, nor would they get civilians to break the law for them to try and trip up those cops.I'm not some perfectionist snob. I understand that fiction needs to take liberties some times. I know that TV shows need to ramp up the action to keep interest. I'm perfectly willing to suspend my disbelief in order to be entertained. But this show just goes way too far beyond that. It's a trend I've been noticing a lot lately with ABC shows. They go big and loud and fast and don't seem the least bit interested with details.If you're looking for some simple fun or you're here because you're a Nathan Fillion fan (that's how I got into this) then by all means give it a try. But for me, I just ended up not being able to stomach the painfully bad plot.	enjoy show well enough time like character well enough even pretty much thing see thousand time kind thing improve time build say write pretty atrocious writer clearly care police work actually work b real world actually work admit far expert former although still much know wrong say know someone clear active duty within week shoot chest without vest know someone walk around perfectly fine week shoot face know cop walk situation without make sure back especially lead brush death seemingly weekly basis know internal affair actually break law try trip cop would get civilian break law try trip cop perfectionist snob understand fiction need take liberty time know tv show need ramp action keep interest perfectly will suspend disbelief order entertain show go way far beyond trend notice lot lately abc show go big loud fast seem least bite interest detail look simple fun nathan fillion fan get mean give try end able stomach painfully bad plot
1	"It's entertaining enough to watch, but the cheesy boat scenes, generally bland dialogue and typically convenient dramatic events leave it lacking. The acting is good for the most part, but some of it feels forced due to the ""language barrier"". I may be ""old man yelling at clouds"" but the ""white savior"" thing is generally a little hard to consider, especially how easily everyone is in awe and captivated by easy manipulation and this is coming from a middle aged white man. There are some moments, so I guess, watch it, enjoy it for what it is, but definitely a show that you won't feel guilty missing out on."	entertain enough watch cheesy boat scene generally bland dialogue typically convenient dramatic event leave lack act good part feel force due language barrier may old man yell cloud white savior thing generally little hard consider especially easily everyone awe captivate easy manipulation come middle age white man moment guess watch enjoy definitely show feel guilty miss
0	"With all the bitching and childish behavior that goes on in this show anyone would expect it to be set in college, not in a hospital. With a great name like Grays Anatomy, one would expect a high premise of medical situations, procedures and indeed, the feelings of the doctors and patients within the hospital. We get none of this. Instead we get a bunch of grown adults acting like children. This is ( and should be classified as) a soap opera, not a ""medical drama"" as the network would have us believe.However, I am aware that some people enjoy petty squabbling between stereotypically pretty people pretending to be doctors by wearing white coats and steamy ""will they wont they"" situations arising between interns and residents. This show has all of that, with none of the complicated (or realistic) medical or hospital business to get in the way of a ""good"" juicy storyline.It really does seem out of place being set in a hospital. The characters don't act or speak like doctors and the hospital is just a backdrop for their petty squabbles or torrid love affairs.This show is saved ONLY by fairly decent acting from the main cast. However, I will add that none of them have any extremely notable charisma, they are just decent actors. If you want to see a good medical drama with real human emotions, comedy, love, friendship, etc...I suggest SCRUBS or BODIES. They're a millions times better."	bitch childish behavior go show anyone would expect set college hospital great name like gray anatomy one would expect high premise medical situation procedure indeed feel doctor patient within hospital get none instead get bunch grow adult act like child classify soap opera medical drama network would we believe however aware people enjoy petty squabble stereotypically pretty people pretend doctor wear white coat steamy will not situation arise intern resident show none complicate realistic medical hospital business get way good juicy storyline really seem place set hospital character act speak like doctor hospital backdrop petty squabble torrid love affairs show save fairly decent act main cast however add none extremely notable charisma decent actor want see good medical drama real human emotion comedy love friendship etc suggest scrub body million time well

1	I really tried to watch this with an open mind and without the inevitable comparison to The Talented Mr Ripley, a movie I rate highly and have watched several times. Admittedly I have not watched other versions or read the book. Unfortunately though, I simply couldn't help making the comparison.From word go in episode one I found this incarnation of Ripley jarring. He comes off as a middle aged grifter, without any sympathetic qualities, simply unlikeable. There seems to me to be no convincing reason that Dickie would immediately take into his home a man coming across as a loser, quite unlikeable and lacking any sophistication required to fit into those circles.Worse, the passage right up until Dickie's murder lacks any development of character or relationships to add any plausibility to the whole scenario. Throughout the movie Ripley simply comes across to me as a psycho, increasingly so, who lacks the qualities or skill to convincingly continue his deceptions.Hard to rate this one, and I'll give it 5 on its own merits as a reasonably binge-worthy series for a rainy day. But I think the casting was too wildly off to do the main character justice.	really try watch open mind without inevitable comparison talente mr ripley movie rate highly watch several time admittedly watch version read book unfortunately though simply help make comparison word go episode one find incarnation ripley jar come middle age grifter without sympathetic quality simply unlikeable seem convince reason dickie would immediately take home man come across loser quite unlikeable lack sophistication require fit circle bad passage right dickie murder lack development character relationship add plausibility whole scenario throughout movie ripley simply come across psycho increasingly lack quality skill convincingly continue deception hard rate one give merit reasonably binge worthy series rainy day think cast wildly main character justice
1	Straight of the bat you're thrown into the world of Fallout, and that intro is really, one of the best intros I've seen any piece of media. It's just a pity those initial scenes were so limited, sort of like the first sip from a cool Nuka-Cola.I wish I cared more about the characters and plot but they really just feel like 2D cardboard cutouts serving the purpose of tour guides to show us the world of Fallout. They do a really good job at this but as a result I they do little to make you care about them.There's also like zero original soundtracks for the show, relying on preexisting soundtracks which were heavily used in the source material, once again reinforcing the idea that the show is relying heavily on the fan service element.It has great action sequences and world building but beyond that, it leaves much to be desired regarding the world of Fallout.	straight bat throw world fallout intro really one good intro see piece medium pity initial scene limit sort like first sip cool nuka cola wish care character plot really feel like cardboard cutout serve purpose tour guide show we world fallout really good job result little make care also like zero original soundtrack show rely preexist soundtrack heavily use source material reinforce idea show rely heavily fan service element great action sequence world build beyond leave much desire regard world fallout

0	I didn't see Game of Thrones the first time around and finally thought I'd see what all the fuss was all about. Honestly, I can't get into it. Obviously it has a bunch of great actors in it, and at least some of it is visually stunning. But I'm not nterested to see beheadings alternated with sex every two minutes, especially when so many of the women are there half-clothed for male titillation and treated like property.I kept hearing about the complex characters and the wonderful plot lines--maybe I didn't stick around long enough. But the gratuitious violence and half-naked women put me off.	see game throne first time around finally think see fuss honestly get obviously bunch great actor least visually stun ntereste see behead alternate sex every two minute especially many woman half clothe male titillation treat like property keep hear complex character wonderful plot line maybe stick around long enough gratuitious violence half naked woman put

1	I was immediately struck by the void of artistry in the direction and cinematography, particularly having watched 'Sometimes I Think About Dying' just before I started watching this (in which EVERY SINGLE SHOT looks like a beautifully composed photograph). It just seems like they flew through it as quickly as possible doing every scene by numbers. As someone who enjoys quality cinema this was an absolute famine for me.So, with nothing to enjoy visually you are left with the meat of the story which had interesting ideas but was a bit 'this happens then this happens then this happens' without any real intrigue or tension beyond 'so... what's the deal with these aliens? Maybe we'll get an answer at the end...' Everything seems to happen a bit too quickly without any real depth. I was interested enough to get answers to the questions but didn't really care about a single character, although the big bloke from GoT was fairly likeable and the show seemed to miss his charisma when he died as no one else had any.People seem to love this story enough that I have to believe there's more to it than what I watched so I am currently in the process of downloading the Tencent version.	immediately strike void artistry direction cinematography particularly watch sometimes think die start watch every single shoot look like beautifully compose photograph seem like fly quickly possible every scene number someone enjoy quality cinema absolute famine nothing enjoy visually leave meat story interest idea bite happen happen happen without real intrigue tension beyond deal alien maybe get answer end everything seem happen bite quickly without real depth interest enough get answer question really care single character although big bloke get fairly likeable show seem miss charisma die one else people seem love story enough believe watch currently process download tencent version
1	"The latest, much-publicized science fiction blockbuster series is ""Fallout"", now streaming on Prime and Freevee (without and with ads, respectively; both are from Amazon). It stars Ella Purnell as Lucy MacLean, Walter Coggins as the mutant bandit ghoul, and Aaron Moten as love interest Maximus. While it is getting a high rating of 8.7 on IMDB I would rate it a barely watchable 6.0. The plot is that VaultTec, a manufacturer of fallout shelters, has conspired with other powerful interests to start a nuclear war in order to drive customers into its shelters. Some 200 years later the surface is inhabited by warring remnants of humanity as well as mutated monsters. This series is based on a popular video game and feels as juvenile as one might therefore expect in spite of its multimillion dollar production. It is not so much science fiction as it is one which is only a couple steps above being a zombie apocalypse film. There are all sorts of plot holes (e.g., how is it with surface obliterated back into the stone age, electricity seems to be working in every abandoned building and high-tech weaponry proliferates). Characters are stereotyped and inauthentic. I also wearied of combining ultraviolent visuals with retro nostalgic singing. I did watch all eight episodes but I think one must be a sci-fi or gaming addict to do so."	latest much publicize science fiction blockbuster series fallout stream prime freevee without ad respectively amazon star ella purnell lucy maclean walter coggins mutant bandit ghoul aaron moten love interest maximus get high rat imdb would rate barely watchable plot vaulttec manufacturer fallout shelter conspire powerful interest start nuclear war order drive customer shelter year later surface inhabit war remnant humanity well mutate monster series base popular video game feel juvenile one might therefore expect spite multimillion dollar production much science fiction one couple step zombie apocalypse film sort plot hole e g surface obliterate back stone age electricity seem work every abandon build high tech weaponry proliferate character stereotype inauthentic also weary combine ultraviolent visual retro nostalgic sing watch eight episode think one must sci fi game addict
1	Every series has its end at some point. I wouldn't wish it on Grey's anatomy, but 16th doesn't make it easy. What bothers me most is the newfangled way of filming. The image moves all the time and things are filmed, like a table, which nobody is interested in. I write this review during the episode because I don't mind missing something, it's not allowed. Stay true to the classic Greys and don't experiment.	every series end point wish grey anatomy th make easy bother newfangle way film image move time thing film like table nobody interest write review episode mind miss something allow stay true classic grey experiment
0	"It's a real consensus that the continuous off-voice narration it's a poor way of telling stories. Grey's anatomy it's not only a poor collection of female anxieties but the actual translation of Steel style pink novels to a TV screen. The only interest in the series is who's going to date this or that carachter.The medical background is weak and totally obscured by the love affairs of everyone inside the hospital, therefore closer to that one in ""Tootsie"" but without the sense of humor and the lovely situations.The closing credits are always preceded with a no sense speech of (sometimes) several minutes, trying to solve the lack of real abilities from producers, actors and directors to tell a story. ""House"" is miles ahead."	real consensus continuous voice narration poor way tell story grey anatomy poor collection female anxiety actual translation steel style pink novel tv screen interest series go date carachter medical background weak totally obscure love affair everyone inside hospital therefore close one tootsie without sense humor lovely situation close credit always precede sense speech sometimes several minute try solve lack real ability producer actor director tell story house mile ahead

1	The first two seasons were good fun run of the mill cop drama with a twist. Season three has matured into a show that explores the political and social climate that the American police is operating within. It's a brave but necessary contribution to the conversation and is yet more evidence that the entertainment industry is finally taking responsibility for educating its viewers. Not surprisingly they're getting hate for it, but I hope it won't be a deterrent to continue this amazing turn that they've taken in making the show worthwhile.	first two season good fun run mill cop drama twist season three mature show explore political social climate american police operate within brave necessary contribution conversation yet evidence entertainment industry finally take responsibility educate viewer surprisingly get hate hope deterrent continue amaze turn take make show worthwhile
2	Doing new things in a cop show is pretty challenging, and The Rookie has nailed it without moronic gimmicks or wacky characters.We spend enough time each episode with the minor characters to get to know them, while hanging out with the central ones long enough to give them depth - that's a hard balancing act in a 42 minute episode. So you actually care with the gruff TO has a junky wife, and Fillons rich college friend gets carjacked and mugged.Each episode has fun with itself with just the right touch of gravitas for what is after all life and death situations. This speaks to the quality of the writing and the pitch perfect delivery of the excellent cast.An interest blend of stories on the big scale and the small, this series delights in surprises while maintaining its credibility and refraining from overtly sappy set ups.Can't wait for the second season.	new thing cop show pretty challenge rookie nail without moronic gimmick wacky character spend enough time episode minor character get know hang central one long enough give depth hard balance act minute episode actually care gruff junky wife fillon rich college friend get carjack mug episode fun right touch gravita life death situation speak quality write pitch perfect delivery excellent cast interest blend story big scale small series delight surprise maintain credibility refrain overtly sappy set up wait second season
1	"Viewers deserved better than what the writers and producers gave them during the latter half of season 7, but much more so throughout season 8. The final season was rushed, as if the writers wanted to get this show over and done with while the finale was insultingly ridiculous.One main character's descent into madness in less than 2 episodes - having been perfectly sane for the preceding 70+ episodes - was comical, and clearly rushed. The writers had to know this was the direction the show was going long before those 2 episodes. They could have, and should have shown her descent into madness starting towards the end of season 7.But that finale? Neither of the 2 ""good"" lead characters got to personally kill the two of you know who ""evil"" characters?! Neither got to make them suffer?! They just get to die by ________ and that's that?!Screw you, writers.I've never seen a more anticlimactic ending for characters that loyal viewers deserved, no, were owed to at least witness them die as painfully and torturously as all their monstrous acts over 8 seasons combined.I can't even begin to address who ended up on the thrown.

Writers did terrible job with hers and Derek's love life. Not natural behavior at all. And the amount of whoring around that happens in the hospital is too much.

I would say it's on par with the Boys which is the best they could have hoped for. It's kinda lacking and some things do become more noticeable when you watch the show. Visual nothing special, did a good job and looks good for what it is. I thought the sets were good but you can definitely tell it was made on location, in studio, on multiple sets but it still looks and feels like Fall Out. Ella Purnell crushed it as, Lucy. Definitely a Vault Dweller where rules applied. When she goes out into the real world she is always looking at things from a logical less confrontational way, which naive in this world. The wasteland is just full of scumbags who have no morals, trying to survive anyway possible. Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy, & Todd Howard did a really good job of adapting this and I must say it feels like the game. I just want to set the right expectation this is not, The Last of Us. This is a super duper fun show and will most definitely keep you entertained.	digge ascetic love incorporate sound game well idk describe like really super duper weird fun violence like game would say par boy well could hop kinda lack thing become noticeable watch show visual nothing special good job look good think set good definitely tell make location studio multiple set still look feel like fall ella purnell crush lucy definitely vault dweller rule apply go real world always look thing logical less confrontational way naive world wasteland full scumbag moral try survive anyway possible jonathan nolan lisa joy todd howard really good job adapt must say feel like game want set right expectation last we super duper fun show definitely keep entertain
2	A brutal and tragic tale of trauma, obsession, abuse, love and self hatred. Donny is a very bad comedian making ends meet by working in a bar. One day, an obese but chirpy lady walks in claiming she is a lawyer, but can't afford a drink. After about 20 minutes, I knew I was going to binge watch it. First two episodes fly by, but it suddenly takes a dark turn in episode 4 which is shown as flashback, and Donnys sexual feelings and vulnerability begin to make some sort of sense. But it is only at the very end, it all falls in place for Donny. She is gone, but he is spending all his time listening to her messages. He suddenly comes across one explaining why she called him Reindeer Baby - she had a cuddly toy of the same name, and it was the only thing that made her feel safe. They were both victims of sexual abuse, and just maybe they were lost souls, who could only relate to each other and nobody else in a bizarre way. He missed her despite everything. Maybe a Season 2?	brutal tragic tale trauma obsession abuse love self hatred donny bad comedian make end meet work bar one day obese chirpy lady walk claim lawyer afford drink minute know go binge watch first two episode fly suddenly take dark turn episode show flashback donnys sexual feel vulnerability begin make sort sense end fall place donny go spend time listen message suddenly come across one explain call reindeer baby cuddly toy name thing make feel safe victim sexual abuse maybe lose soul could relate nobody else bizarre way miss despite everything maybe season
2	The first two episodes were great and some of the best TV I had watched in the last couple of years. But, as it progressed, the show started to diverge away from the best aspects of the show- the feud and the politics. Now, the whole show has turned into a romance drama revolving around Blackthorne and Mariko. Things pertaining to Shogun are in the backdrop. I had to fast forward 5-10 minutes of an episode last week out of boredom. That's how stretched out the later episodes feel compared to the first two.I hope the next episodes would be better but have a feeling this will feel more and more like a family drama.	first two episode great good tv watch last couple year progress show start diverge away good aspect show feud politic whole show turn romance drama revolve around blackthorne mariko thing pertain shogun backdrop fast forward minute episode last week boredom stretch later episode feel compare first two hope next episode would well feel feel like family drama
1	The way Game of Thrones pulls you in from the outset is a tremendous achievement in entertainment, to be sure. The narrative continues to churn and twist, flexing it's impressive potential pretty well right up to the end. Then the writing simply caves in on itself for one of the most disappointing finales you will ever see of any show of this caliber in which you could imagine investing 8 years of anticipation of what you could only assume, judging by the standards it sets for itself, would be a final, glorious, fulfilling conclusion to a sweeping epic. To give this series a 7/10 absolutely required that the first 7 seasons, and perhaps the first 6 episodes of season 8, merit a 9/10, because the finale in the last 2 episodes was, at a generous best, worth maybe a 4/10 or 5/10...at best. It truly felt like the writers had neither the tact nor talent to fulfil the narrative and bailed out in a panic, delegating the task to their children as a homework assignment. Considering the expectations and investment, this has to rank quite easily as one of the most disappointing endings to any kind of story that I have ever known. Pathetic.	way game throne pull outset tremendous achievement entertainment sure narrative continue churn twist flex impressive potential pretty well right end write simply cave one disappoint finale ever see show caliber could imagine invest year anticipation could assume judge standard set would final glorious fulfil conclusion sweep epic give series absolutely require first season perhaps first episode season merit finale last episode generous good worth maybe well truly feel like writer neither tact talent fulfil narrative bail panic delegate task child homework assignment consider expectation investment rank quite easily one disappoint end kind story ever know pathetic

1	I did not read the books nor was I familiar with them. I watched the first couple of episodes on a plane flight and was kicking myself for not downloading more. I was extremely excited about the show and thought it had a ton of interesting and fun ideas / stories and potential. Watched episode 3 on the Uber home I was so in enthralled.Sadly, I finished episode 6, and am having to call it quits. It feels slapped together, lacking development and any depth, void of subtlety, character actions are nonsensical for no reason... massive events just happen with no lead up or planning or thought or emotions, and the love interest scenarios feel forced and uninteresting. I'll give that the benefit of the doubt though as maybe it actually does play some role in the plot later rather than just shoved in for no reason.Pretty bummed to have so quickly gone from falling asleep with thoughts about the show running through my head and captivating me, to trying to force my way through episode 7 before giving up and buying the books. Good way to sell some more books though!TL:DR - Awesome start, then fell off. Maybe more enjoyable with lower expectations and not thinking too hard about it.	read book familiar watch first couple episode plane flight kick download extremely excite show think ton interest fun idea story potential watch episode uber home enthral sadly finish episode call quit feel slap together lack development depth void subtlety character action nonsensical reason massive event happen lead plan think emotion love interest scenario feel force uninteresting give benefit doubt though maybe actually play role plot later rather shove reason pretty bum quickly go fall asleep thought show run head captivate try force way episode give buy book good way sell book though tl dr awesome start fall maybe enjoyable low expectation think hard
1	Show is jumping the shark in season 5. More unrealistic situations like cars teetering on the edge of buildings and episode 10 an office drilling into the bottom of a vehicle to spray mace. The protocol for an LA cop would not permit these scenarios. The tie in with a the Feds show is annoying as Niecy Nash is the most unlikely person for this role. Not the least believable. The romance angle is unnecessary. Keep to police story lines. Nolan's role is reducing and is no longer the premise for the show. It was a good run for 4 years but I Can't see the show going much longer it's lost it's way.	show jump shark season unrealistic situation like car teeter edge build episode office drill bottom vehicle spray mace protocol la cop would permit scenario tie feds show annoy niecy nash unlikely person role least believable romance angle unnecessary keep police story line nolan role reduce long premise show good run year see show go much long lose way

What a waste.This series is filmed beautifully, acted exquisitely and edited beautifully yet set a foundation of frustration upon you. Ah, what it could have been.In colour, one can imagine the immense beauty and character this film would seep with. Instead, in its churned reserved stale visual reincarnation it's hard to look past it.Whether an artistic or directorial stubbornist, it finds oneself overlooking the beauty of the cinematography, the delicate acting and erudite dialogue: absolutely wasted.

1	Really loved this series.It's still visually stunning, the music is still breathtaking and the production quality overall is just mindblowing - except when it comes to writing. 7 seasons if storyline were butchered, including the main villain and basically all of the main characters. It wasn't a factor of me not agreeing or me not being 'happy' about it - they literally destroyed their storlyines and made them act like different people whilst all they, and therefore we had gone through, meant nothing. It's been extremely painful to see such decline in what was genuinely the best thing to grace television. I truly believe that.I'll still give it a 7.

I know, I'll be hung from the gallows for saying such, but I gave up half way through season 3 as I found myself just getting angry at all the characters.

She was the MOST ANNOYING person on the show. I was soooooooooooo glad when she left!! I couldn't watch most of it because of her. She's the reason I rates it 7 Stars, because although it was a great show..... SHE RUINED IT FOR ME!!!!! I'm surprised this show is even still running. I'll try to get caught up so I can watch it again but I seriously doubt it!!	go back season stop watch dr shepard die realize one reason irritate word christina yang annoy person show soooooooooooo glad leave watch reason rat star although great show ruin surprise show even still run try get catch watch seriously doubt
1	I don't know the games and I don't know if that's an advantage or a disadvantage (for judging the show) - anyway, the show offers solid entertainment with some funny moments, the production is top-notch for a TV show, and the cast is solid too. What annoys me the most is the soundtrack - not necessarily the music itself, but in my opinion, too many scenes are unnecessarily underscored with music that often doesn't fit what's being shown, and it sometimes really gets on my nerves - less is more so to say. Other than that, if you don't expect too much, you'll get well-produced trash without great aspirations: popcorn cinema for the right kind of audience - I enjoyed the ride but for sure Fallout is not a masterpiece like so many reviewers claim but way better than Halo or The Last of Us.	know game know advantage disadvantage judge show anyway show offer solid entertainment funny moment production top notch tv show cast solid annoy soundtrack necessarily music opinion many scene unnecessarily underscore music often fit show sometimes really get nerve less say expect much get well produce trash without great aspiration popcorn cinema right kind audience enjoy ride sure fallout masterpiece like many reviewer claim way well halo last we
2	Andrew Scott gives a deeply neurotic and disturbing impression of one of the most beloved psychopaths in movie history. He's a great actor and he knows exactly what he's doing, sharp, precise, intense, on top of his acting skills.Zaillian stretches the story out here, (sometimes a little bit too much in the last three episodes), taking 8 hours, compared to shorter former versions. I must say I like all versions, because Highsmith's original story is of genius quality, and it allows to open a lot of doors to different interpretations. I loved Alain Delon in the Rene Clement classic, as well as Matt Damon in the luscious Minghella version, but comparing the different interpretations in detail would take to long.About this one: Yes, I loved that it was shot in atmospheric black and white (fantastic cinematography, every frame a piece of art!), I loved that this version was slow, I loved that it was so dark, I loved the sardonic humour.I could have easily given this version 10 stars, but, I am sorry to say, the characterization of Freddie Miles didn't work for me here.	andrew scott give deeply neurotic disturb impression one beloved psychopath movie history great actor know exactly sharp precise intense top act skill zaillian stretch story sometimes little bite much last three episode take hour compare short former version must say like version highsmith original story genius quality allow open lot door different interpretation love alain delon rene clement classic well matt damon luscious minghella version compare different interpretation detail would take long one yes love shoot atmospheric black white fantastic cinematography every frame piece art love version slow love dark love sardonic humour could easily give version star sorry say characterization freddie mile work

2	I am really glad that this adaptation wasn't ruined.I am a big fan of the games, and it brings me joy to see it go through.It is slow in the beginning with the world building stories, therefore for someone who comes from the game with knowledge about the world it can get boring.But it is done right. And after ep.4 I was sucked in and binge watched until the end.There are some inconsistencies, but they are easy to overlook for regular audience which is the target audience. But there are easter eggs and mentions for us folks.Acting is good, most of the times.Line up is perfect, as far as I am concerned and very well picked.Gore and action aren't over the top and blends in with the theme.Story is intriguing and captivating, and makes you crave more.They did a really good job with costumes and CGI which are good and in place.All in all, solid 9 and I can't wait to see the next season.	really glad adaptation ruin big fan game bring joy see go slow begin world build story therefore someone come game knowledge world get bore do right ep suck binge watch end inconsistency easy overlook regular audience target audience easter egg mention us folk act good time line perfect far concern well pick gore action top blend theme story intrigue captivate make crave really good job costume cgi good place solid wait see next season

Let's see (obligatory spoiler alert, of course) though there's not much to spoil since I'm writing this now for a show that's been on six years. Anyway, let's start. Brother and sister having sex while the latter is married to the king, passing off their offspring as his. Human babies being offered up to strange zombie-like creatures by a father who marries his own daughters. A torture scene involving rats, various body parts cut off, rape scenes, castration scenes, this is basically Saw movie levels of entertainment. I'll give some credit for the first season for at least being original, as well as aforementioned high quality production values, but after that (I watched season 2 as well on DVD, then looked up the rest via summaries on the Internet), and the basic theme doesn't change, really. It's basically what new kinds of shock scenes can they through at us without anything ever being resolved. Good characters are killed (won't spoil it by saying which ones) and the rest basically scheme and backstab each other. Think of the worst types of office politics only played with swords and various other medieval weapons. Bleah!

1	I have quickly gotten bored with this show. I was FAITHFUL in tuning in every single week and had my box of tissues right next to me. I have just never been able to stomach Merideth, watching her storyline alone became exhausting and repetitive. After the season with the hospital shooting, it just fell off after that. Then after Merideth and Derrick adopted a black baby, I had enough. I am tired of shows depicting what other celebrities are doing or trying to keep ratings by going with a trend. It ruined it for me that my beloved George and Izzy are gone, which I still think was the producers biggest mistake letting them go. Hopefully I will regain interest soon, I am hearing good things.	quickly get bore show faithful tune every single week box tissue right next never able stomach merideth watch storyline alone become exhaust repetitive season hospital shoot fall merideth derrick adopt black baby enough tire show depict celebrity try keep rat go trend ruin beloved george izzy go still think producer big mistake let go hopefully regain interest soon hear good thing

0	"This cast of emotionally stunted, confidence-deficient characters make you wonder how they ever put their socks on, paid a bill, cooked mac 'n' cheese, much less got through life, let alone med school, let alone conflicts, let alone surgeries. These caricatures of adults with their never-ending internecine dramas make kindergartner sandbox politics look like high-level international deal brokers by contrast. Meredith and that babysqueak voice who holds an endless torch for a dead-ender; Alex and his abject d-baggery, betrayals, and frat-boy antics; Cristina with an emotional iq of -- somehow is ""brilliant""/please?!; McDreamy who can rewire brains but can't figure out that he doesn't like his wife anymore; McNally who's got an elementary-grade crush--and what is with the unbelievable high body count? The death rate on the ORT makes it look like they got their med degrees at a vending machine. After a few episodes, we saw the pattern, ""Oh, s/he's not going to make it. That one's going to croak,"" and sure enough, we could predict with 95% certainty what would happen. It would be a comedy if the jokes were better and a drama if it weren't lathered in soapy ridiculousness. Total snoozer. This show's characters needed to have mature, internally strong personalities with high moral integrity and backbones working on patients--these show docs are often selfish, egotistical, dismissive, condescending and contemptible toward their patients--WHY would they go into medicine/surgery if they were misanthropes and preferred gazing at their bellybuttons (and below) more than saving lives and advancing medicine?

2	Like many other reviewers here, I am a diehard fan of the Fallout games. My introduction to the game series began 25 years ago when I picked up a copy of Fallout 2 and I've been hooked ever since. Never, in all that time, had I ever wished for a spinoff TV series to be made about it. Who asked for it? Not me! But nevertheless, here it is. It exists whether we like it or not and no matter how many negative reviews people submit based on pride, protest, or principle it will not change that fact. Look, no one is forcing anyone who strongly objects to this series to watch it (not yet anyway). But if its mere existence truly offends you, just don't watch it! What is there to gain by coming here to thumbs down positive reviews because you are so aggrieved? Anyone and everyone is free to ignore the show, just like I'm choosing to ignore the sense of entitlement these petty review-bombers have by giving this new series the glowing review it rightfully deserves based on the merits.With that business out of the way, my review here is for anyone with a sincere interest in this series in deciding whether they should give it a chance. And to that I say yes, absolutely you should whether you are a fan of the games or not. As I previously mentioned, I never asked for this show and was prepared to hate it. But I kept an open mind as I watched and did my best to be fair in my overall judgement. And the truth is, the show is actually pretty fantastic. I was not prepared for it to be as good as it is. This show definitely caters to fans of the franchise with its high attention to detail and faithfulness to source material. I sympathize with those who would have preferred that Hollywood not make the series in the first place, but at the same time, now having watched it, the hate towards it is pretty unjustified if the only crime is that it exists.To the angry Fallout fans I ask you this: Imagine a TV series is being made about this game that you and I both love. Imagine that it's completely out of your control, and production is actually happening. If a Fallout series HAS to exist, what exactly would you want it to look like? Would it not be similar to exactly what Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have created? I mean, visually it's pretty spot on. They've built an immersive world that feels very authentic. It feels like Fallout, it looks like Fallout, and it sounds like Fallout. Okay, maybe you would have preferred the show was modeled after the Interplay games and not Bethesda's Fallout 4, or maybe you would have preferred the show runners double and triple check the accuracy of the lore because you find any cannon inconsistency unforgiveable.So let's address the elephant in the room: Yes, there are some glaring lore issues. But it doesn't bother me. Why? Because a TV series is a different medium for storytelling than a video game. For the sake of argument, let's assume this new series runs for 8 seasons with 8 one-hour episodes each. That's a total of 64 hours screen time. That's just a fraction of what most people put into playing a single game. I've put hundreds of hours into Fallout 4 alone. When playing a game, you have the luxury of time to explore it and study it as much as you like. That's the beauty of Fallout games. But television doesn't work that way. It's not interactive. The entertainment comes from literally just sitting in front of a screen and watching/listening to a story. Viewers are going to tune out fast if it becomes overly pedantic and boring. Sometimes it is necessary to truncate and/or modify original source material so that it translates better on screen and can hold the viewers' attention.For me personally, as a longtime fan, what mattered most was that the series captured the spirit, message, and immersive atmosphere of the games. No matter what, it needed to look and feel like Fallout, and Nolan and Joy nailed it. I don't know what more they could have done to make the series better than it is, and I'm honestly relieved that the creative liberties taken were not so egregious as to disrespect the entire franchise and its fanbase. On the contrary, they've done an excellent job here. They could have reimagined Fallout into some truly terrible fan fiction, but they didn't. It feels like a true extension of the Fallout universe and that's all I had hoped for. Jonathan Nolan made this series because he is also a fan and avid player of Fallout games. If anyone could pull it off, it was him.	like many reviewer diehard fan fallout game introduction game series begin year ago pick copy fallout hook ever since never time ever wish spinoff tv series make ask nevertheless exist whether like matter many negative review people submit base pride protest principle change fact look one force anyone strongly object series watch yet anyway mere existence truly offend watch gain come thumb positive review aggrieve anyone everyone free ignore show like choose ignore sense entitlement petty review bomber give new series glow review rightfully deserve base merit business way review anyone sincere interest series decide whether give chance say yes absolutely whether fan game previously mention never ask show prepare hate keep open mind watch well fair overall judgement truth show actually pretty fantastic prepare good show definitely cater fan franchise high attention detail faithfulness source material sympathize would prefer hollywood make series first place time watch hate towards pretty unjustified crime exist angry fallout fan ask imagine tv series make game love imagine completely control production actually happen fallout series exist exactly would want look like would similar exactly jonathan nolan lisa joy create mean visually pretty spot build immersive world feel authentic feel like fallout look like fallout sound like fallout okay maybe would prefer show model interplay game bethesda fallout maybe would prefer show runner double triple check accuracy lore find cannon inconsistency unforgiveable let address elephant room yes glare lore issue bother tv series different medium storytelle video game sake argument let assume new series run season one hour episode total hour screen time fraction people put play single game put hundred hour fallout alone play game luxury time explore study much like beauty fallout game television work way interactive entertainment come literally sit front screen watch listen story viewer go tune fast become overly pedantic bore sometimes necessary truncate modify original source material translate well screen hold viewer attention personally longtime fan matter series capture spirit message immersive atmosphere game matter need look feel like fallout nolan joy nail know could do make series well honestly relieve creative liberty take egregious disrespect entire franchise fanbase contrary do excellent job could reimagine fallout truly terrible fan fiction feel like true extension fallout universe hop jonathan nolan make series also fan avid player fallout game anyone could pull
1	Fallout is a very beloved series amongst Gamers with Its extensive world-building and Lore. The variety of factions and people that populate Its Wastelands to its themes of Corporatism and political ambition and its Morality & Ethics of Human Society. It's ripe for the picking stories to be told. All and all Fallout does well in not only respecting its source material but also serving as an entry point for newcomers without holding your hand. Putting you in the perspective of its main character starting with Lucy the vault dweller. Given her isolated upbringing and what she has been told her whole life. She's reckless, Naive, and Gullible. She has to adapt and learn from the people she comes across. And the choices she has to make and live with. The other two main characters. The Ghoul who is my favorite just this complete Badass bounty hunter and Cold-hearted man. You get to see his past pre-war and what's driving him. Maximus this brotherhood Squire who goes rogue in ways makes questionable choices in brotherhood. All three of their stories are tied to this Scientist. Also, this sub-plot Mystery Centered around Vault-tec. It feels Balanced out and paced the journey. You don't need to know everything about the Enclave, Brotherhood, or NCR. Prop also has to be given to the designers. I felt that they would have just done the bare minimum. The only well-made would've been the power armor. No, they did put effort into capturing the setting and atmosphere of the games. Morbid dark and violent. The Vaults Corps. Things like the Pip-Boy display and how it functions. The Action Lots of Blood and the use perfect use of Slo-mo Call back to V. A. T. S. The choice of Music how they had original Music, but also took from the Game Soundtrack and the way it's used adds to the charm. Overall, I enjoyed it, and for another season if it stays this route.	fallout beloved series amongst gamer extensive world build lore variety faction people populate wasteland theme corporatism political ambition morality ethic human society ripe pick story tell fallout well respect source material also serve entry point newcomer without hold hand put perspective main character start lucy vault dweller give isolate upbringing tell whole life reckless naive gullible adapt learn people come across choice make live two main character ghoul favorite complete badass bounty hunter cold hearted man get see past pre war drive maximus brotherhood squire go rogue way make questionable choice brotherhood three story tie scientist also sub plot mystery center around vault tec feel balance pace journey need know everything enclave brotherhood ncr prop also give designer feel would do bare minimum well make would power armor put effort capture set atmosphere game morbid dark violent vault corps thing like pip boy display function action lot blood use perfect use slo mo call back v choice music original music also take game soundtrack way use add charm overall enjoy another season stay route
2	I love grey's anatomy. It is a wonderful show, and it's sweet, funny, and fun to watch. The characters I like the most are: Bailey, Chief, and Christina. The show is all about doctors, and operations, and of course, relationships. I think this show can go on and on and on for a long time. I think it will do well. I hope it makes more than 4 seasons, because I think that it's a really popular show. All the characters are good, and all the actors and actresses play their own character well, so I don't see it stopping at season 4. When I first watched season 1, I loved it. Then I watched season 2, I liked it, but didn't love it. I thought season 1 was too short, but I think it was better then season 2, in a way. Season 3 was good, but not excellent. I love grey's anatomy, and I'm so glad they're still showing it on air. I give the whole show a 10/10.	love grey anatomy wonderful show sweet funny fun watch character like bailey chief christina show doctor operation course relationship think show go long time think well hope make season think really popular show character good actor actress play character well see stop season first watch season love watch season like love think season short think well season way season good excellent love grey anatomy glad still show air give whole show
2	"I get it, it kinda sucks when they don't stick with the source material, but I think it's fine in this case. It's not a 100% accurate adaptation anyway, since they wanted to make it more ""international"", and that's okay -- you can change some characters and still retain the main story elements.They cut a lot from the story, but let's face it, the first halves of the first two books were not that great. There was plenty -- and I mean plenty -- to cut; the books had a jarring amount of exposition, irrelevant stories, and mathematical jargon. I mean, yeah, the math and science bits were interesting in themselves, but they don't exactly make a good story for a book.Sure, maybe they cut a bit too much at some points, like there happened a lot more in the Red Coast, they could have added a bit more of that. And I get that they cut off some the ETO stuff, which was quite boring at times, but not to mention the ETO even with one word? Yeah, maybe they went a bit far with that one. But other than that, I think the changes were good. Generally, they managed to cut the boring parts and expanded on the more interesting details and made the overall story much more cohesive. I think it was mainly for the better.It's a great show, acting, casting, and script is mostly good. Sure, it's not a masterpiece, but I liked it and it was entertaining and kept me on the hook. I literally binge-watched this in two days, so it is not really that bad at all. Give it a shot, it's only going to get better, as the story progresses and starts to show its more unique aspects. (I just hope they cut the boring bits about the second book, as well. Like, I seriously hope that one third of the season is not that random, irrelevant romance in the forest BS that had zero effect on the story.)"	get kinda suck stick source material think fine case accurate adaptation anyway since want make international okay change character still retain main story element cut lot story let face first halve first two book great plenty mean plenty cut book jar amount exposition irrelevant story mathematical jargon mean yeah math science bit interest exactly make good story book sure maybe cut bite much point like happen lot red coast could add bite get cut eto stuff quite bore time mention eto even one word yeah maybe go bite far one think change good generally manage cut bore part expand interest detail make overall story much cohesive think mainly well great show act cast script mostly good sure masterpiece like entertain keep hook literally binge watch two day really bad give shoot go get well story progress start show unique aspect hope cut bore bit second book well like seriously hope one third season random irrelevant romance forest bs zero effect story

There are only 2 reasons to make a black and white movie,1/ colour film hadn't been invented.2/ you were making a war film and you wanted to cut in original war film into the movie.This would have been stunning to see filmed in colour, but the director had other ideas, the guy playing Ripley has all the charisma of a brick and a not very charismatic brick at that,I'm only at episode 1 and ready to give up, we live in a colourful world and we have misery served up in black nd white.	director think film one colourful place earth film black white bum reason make black white movie colour film invent make war film want cut original war film movie would stun see film colour director idea guy play ripley charisma brick charismatic brick episode ready give live colourful world misery serve black nd white
0	Absolutely no match to the 1980 TV series. That one was focusing on the drama, and did not try to look like an authentic depiction of year 1600 Japan. It had dramatic composition, good actors, and beautiful Japanese scenery, none of which this movie has.This movie has absolutely no dramatic composition, it feels like a documentary on Anjin's adventures in Japan, re-enacted, alas the story is almost all made up. It pretends to deliver an authentic year 1600 Japan, they employed all those experts to recreate the contemporary language and textiles, but they put all that in a landscape that is not Japanese at all, it looks like what it is, Canadian. The Japanese architecture is obviously computerI generated, and I guess that it is way too grandiose and lavish for war-torn Japan of the time. You hardly ever see a shot that is all real, no natural light, throughout the movie, it feels like we are in a computer game, and they keep using these wide-angle lenses with blurred and barrel-distorted background, I guess to make the CGI less obvious. The make-up is hardly authentic, rather it is made to look sexy to the modern viewer. Beauty ideals of the period were different; blackening the teeth for example was a common practice, especially for women, never to appear here. Surely the language sounds far more natural to the period than in the 1980 series, but if they paid so much attention to the Japanese language, how come all the Portuguese conversations are in English? The acting is dry, as you expect in a re-enacting, but Mariko is particularly disturbing, her Westernized facial gestures and walking clumsily in kimono is inauthentic even for a modern Japanese.	absolutely match tv series one focus drama try look like authentic depiction year japan dramatic composition good actor beautiful japanese scenery none movie movie absolutely dramatic composition feel like documentary anjin adventure japan enact alas story almost make pretend deliver authentic year japan employ expert recreate contemporary language textile put landscape japanese look like canadian japanese architecture obviously computeri generate guess way grandiose lavish war tear japan time hardly ever see shoot real natural light throughout movie feel like computer game keep use wide angle lense blur barrel distort background guess make cgi less obvious make hardly authentic rather make look sexy modern viewer beauty ideal period different blacken tooth example common practice especially woman never appear surely language sound far natural period series pay much attention japanese language come portuguese conversation english act dry expect enact mariko particularly disturb westernize facial gesture walk clumsily kimono inauthentic even modern japanese
2	I actually came in expecting this show to be bad. Honestly, most the trailers I saw looked cringe and poorly put together. Thankfully, those trailers captured a few lesser moments but it didnt hurt the overally quality of the show.Yes, Lucy can be a bit annoying at times but after a few episodes her character continued to develop and she settled into the role. We also follow Maximus, the Ghoul and Norm. I was interested in each of the side stories that tied everything together.This is a great and rare example of how a show doesn't have to perfectly follow the games but can still be very good when you strike a good balance between characters, lore and storytelling while still tapping into the things that made it special in the first place. Something the recent Halo show failed miserably at.They also earn extra points by including dogs as an integral part of the story. After all, it was the thought of dogs being left out of the vaults that pushed Cooper(the ghoul) over the edge and into discovering what Val-tec was really about.This is a really fun, gory, dark but enjoyable ride. Looking forward to the next season for sure.	actually come expect show bad honestly trailer see look cringe poorly put together thankfully trailer capture less moment do not hurt overally quality show yes lucy bite annoy time episode character continue develop settle role also follow maximus ghoul norm interest side story tie everything together great rare example show perfectly follow game still good strike good balance character lore storytelle still tap thing make special first place something recent halo show fail miserably also earn extra point include dog integral part story think dog leave vault push cooper ghoul edge discover val tec really really fun gory dark enjoyable ride look forward next season sure
0	Lack of linguistic fidelity: -Dialogues in English when they should be in Portuguese, compromising immersion in the story and cultural authenticity.-Incorrect pronunciation of Portuguese, with a heavy English accent that sounds artificial and even caricatured.-Lack of attention to linguistic details, such as grammar and vocabulary errors.Inappropriate stereotypes and representations: -Portuguese characters portrayed in a negative light, as being ignorant, superstitious or violent.-Exaggerations and distortions of Portuguese culture, reinforcing pre-existing stereotypes.-Lack of research and historical accuracy in the representation of the time and events portrayed.Devaluation of the Portuguese language and Portuguese culture: -The choice to make the series in English rather than Portuguese can be seen as devaluing the Portuguese language and culture.-The lack of care taken with the Portuguese language in the series can be seen as a lack of respect for speakers of the language and for Portuguese culture.-The series can contribute to the perpetuation of negative stereotypes about Portugal and the Portuguese.Conclusion: -The Shogun series, despite having great production value, displays a disrespect for the Portuguese language and for Portugal. It is important to criticize the series for these problems and to demand greater quality and rigor in productions that portray Portuguese culture.	lack linguistic fidelity dialogue english portuguese compromise immersion story cultural authenticity incorrect pronunciation portuguese heavy english accent sound artificial even caricature lack attention linguistic detail grammar vocabulary error inappropriate stereotype representation portuguese character portray negative light ignorant superstitious violent exaggeration distortion portuguese culture reinforce pre exist stereotype lack research historical accuracy representation time event portray devaluation portuguese language portuguese culture choice make series english rather portuguese see devalue portuguese language culture lack care take portuguese language series see lack respect speaker language portuguese culture series contribute perpetuation negative stereotype portugal portuguese conclusion shogun series despite great production value display disrespect portuguese language portugal important criticize series problem demand great quality rigor production portray portuguese culture

2	When this limited series popped up on Netflix, I only intended to watch the first couple of episodes, but I ended up binge-watching the entire series in one go.The story follows struggling comedian Donny (played by the show's writer and director, Richard Gadd), who encounters a crazy woman named Martha. What starts as an awkward encounter escalates into a horrifying situation. Gunning delivers a chilling performance as Martha, while Gadd portrays Donny's descent into fear with raw vulnerability.I like going into a show blind, yet I find it's only the best ones that can hook me in quickly when I don't know anything about it; otherwise, I like to have some knowledge of what it's about.Reindeer can be described as a black comedy, but it also has much tension, making it equally a dark psychological drama. The opening credits start with a notice that it's based on actual events. I have no idea how much of it has been embellished for artistic license. Honestly, you couldn't make this up, and while it's a strange story that unfolds, nothing in it is unbelievable.While the show does provide some funny moments, it's a lot more than a comedy. It has as much tension, if not more, than an A-list Hollywood blockbuster thriller. There are moments when I cringe as if I were in the room with them, feeling the awkward tension, and other moments where I feel myself shouting at the screen, warning Donny to get out quickly before his stalker, Martha, sees him.Baby Reindeer isn't afraid to tackle tough topics like drugs, mental health, and sexual abuse. The show's unflinching portrayal might not be for everyone, hence the 18+ rating.I've always thought being a stand-up comedian is a tough job. Richard Gadd gives a fantastic performance of his own bad comedy routine that doesn't hit the mark, and I found myself rooting for him to tell a better joke and for the audience to laugh. I gained a whole new level of respect for comedians.If you enjoy thought-provoking dark dramas with solid performances and a touch of humour, I highly recommend Baby Reindeer.	limit series pop netflix intend watch first couple episode end binge watch entire series one go story follow struggle comedian donny play show writer director richard gadd encounter crazy woman name martha start awkward encounter escalate horrify situation gun deliver chill performance martha gadd portray donny descent fear raw vulnerability like go show blind yet find good one hook quickly know anything otherwise like knowledge reindeer describe black comedy also much tension make equally dark psychological drama open credit start notice base actual event idea much embellish artistic license honestly make strange story unfold nothing unbelievable show provide funny moment lot comedy much tension list hollywood blockbuster thriller moment cringe room feel awkward tension moment feel shout screen warn donny get quickly stalker martha see baby reindeer afraid tackle tough topic like drug mental health sexual abuse show unflinche portrayal might everyone hence rat always think stand comedian tough job richard gadd give fantastic performance bad comedy routine hit mark find root tell well joke audience laugh gain whole new level respect comedian enjoy think provoke dark drama solid performance touch humour highly recommend baby reindeer
0	Starting with the casting, which is atrocious (only Dakota Fanning is good for that role). Tom and Dickie, they're too old for the roles, they don't look like each other at all, no chemistry, no friendship between them, just dullness. And don't get me started with Freddie Miles, my god. Andre Scott is a good actor, but whomever though this was a good fit for the role, should be fired.There's more substance, style and development in 2 hours of Anthony Minghella's movie than in 8 whole hours of this.People calling this a masterpiece should watch the movie instead, it's better in every aspect.	start cast atrocious dakota fan good role tom dickie old role look like chemistry friendship dullness get start freddie mile god andre scott good actor whomever though good fit role fire substance style development hour anthony minghella movie whole hour people call masterpiece watch movie instead well every aspect

She's mentally lost but supposed to be the best fighter from Vault 23.Second) the ghoul gun fighter reminds of the Spaghetti western My Name is Nobody and acts worst than thst character.The subplot, if there's one, has nothing to with Fallout.The area has something to do with Fallout and thats all.The 8s,9s and 10s from reviewers and critics are heinous and no one actually played all the games.Fake creation of Fallout history.The dog is the only good actor.The writing for the whole story/episodes is childish and robotic.The musical score is the worst especially in Episode 1 fight scene.	first lucy mcclean close lucy macclane character bad parody brenden fraser character blast past mentally lose suppose good fighter vault second ghoul gun fighter remind spaghetti western name nobody act bad thst character subplot one nothing fallout area something fallout that s reviewer critic heinous one actually play game fake creation fallout history dog good actor write whole story episode childish robotic musical score worst especially episode fight scene
0	I am noticing the degrading quality of current way of story telling and making films in this industry, which employs a disgusting technique to conduct systematic attacks on a normal person's psyche.One of the most subtle technique is to relax the audience first by showing a calm and safe scene or environment...then out of nowehere attack their sense with extremely discomforting scenarios, like animal abuse or extreme violence, mistrust, dropping a atomic bomb on a nice summer day family gathering, other kind 'wanting to shock and attack the open mind' tactics....... And any type of relationship is reduced to animalistic sex, nothing more, empty, meaningless, there sole purpose is shock value, not creating complex but deeper bonds, just sex = love, but it will turn into hate the next moment because people engaged never knew one another to begin with.....Relax the audience and shock them. Especially with unneccesaary Violence, mistrust and lack of true connection.This show is no exception for employing such disgusting tactics to assault human sensibility and psyche. Our minds when open... begin to trust and take in and ready to really open up to receive more information, thats why they create scenes that build such trust of audience and then bombard them with abusive elements.If people are unaware of this, they just absorb this as normal and even appreciate it, while subconsciously they will be programmed to on a celluar level, because body remembers, to never truly trust and relax into the beneficial nature of reality and human nature.They just want the audience live in subtle mistrust and anxiety and most relationships they show on tv nowadays do not have redeeming, long lasting, deeper bond qualities, it is often disconnected, empty, build mistrust and shock value oriented.I noticed plenty of all that in this series.Nothing deep. Incredibly shallow and empty, and unneccesarily violent.It does not make the world any one bit better.I could not even finish first episode as i recognized what is so rampant in current trend of film making in this one..I pass this, as it's energy is really yucky.	notice degrade quality current way story tell make film industry employ disgust technique conduct systematic attack normal person psyche one subtle technique relax audience first show calm safe scene environment nowehere attack sense extremely discomforte scenario like animal abuse extreme violence mistrust drop atomic bomb nice summer day family gather kind want shock attack open mind tactic type relationship reduce animalistic sex nothing empty meaningless sole purpose shock value create complex deep bond sex love turn hate next moment people engage never know one another begin relax audience shock especially unneccesaary violence mistrust lack true connection show exception employ disgust tactic assault human sensibility psyche mind open begin trust take ready really open receive information that s create scene build trust audience bombard abusive element people unaware absorb normal even appreciate subconsciously program celluar level body remember never truly trust relax beneficial nature reality human nature want audience live subtle mistrust anxiety relationship show tv nowadays redeem long last deep bond quality often disconnect empty build mistrust shock value orient notice plenty series nothing deep incredibly shallow empty unneccesarily violent make world one bite well could even finish first episode recognize rampant current trend film make one pass energy really yucky
1	"In all honesty Greys Anatomy is a decent show and just one I watched from the culture popularity of it. ""Mcdreamy"" Meredith, etc. It starts weak and cheesy with voice over but it grew on me and became acceptable as I justified it's tv and apparently it's their style. With elevator clips in a non moving elevator. I could go on about everything in greys anatomy that I don't like, how characters don't show growth until season 3. I thinks it over rated, had a strong start but as it progresses no one learns from their mistakes and keep the same pattern, it makes me passionately hate everyone in the show. But I will not lie, up through season 5 into 6 it kept me going in hopes that my questions were answered, but often ignored. Spoilers Another thing that bothered me was the inconsistency throughout the show. That MEREDITH DIDNT ANSWER A SINGLE QUESTION ON THE INTERN EXAM AND STILL BECAME A RESIDENT?!

1	It's a slow burn science fiction show with major plot issues.The aliens become afraid of humans and decide to exterminate us when they learn that we are capable of not telling the truth on purpose, lying. Yet several months before they leaned that humans can lie the aliens sent an advanced AI computer to Earth that would completely change actual results of all of our scientific experiments and provide us with false information, A LIE. Their advanced computer is lying to us so that our technology never advanced to a level that can one day destroy these invaders. They are capable of lying and should destroy themselves.The scene where the wire that can cut through anything was used to kill was intense. I don't understand why the scientist that created it had to watch everything on the monitors and then was allowed to sift through the body parts. She was really annoying.	slow burn science fiction show major plot issue alien become afraid human decide exterminate we learn capable tell truth purpose lie yet several month lean human lie alien send advance ai computer earth would completely change actual result scientific experiment provide we false information lie advance computer lie we technology never advance level one day destroy invader capable lie destroy scene wire cut anything use kill intense understand scientist create watch everything monitor allow sift body part really annoy
1	They keep the style of the games, music but unfortunately they keep Bethesda tradition of poor and uninspiring dialogues.TV series is clearly made for game fans. .There's no much intro into world building, what is the background of each fraction.Some moments looks unrealistic and unlogical even for Fallout retro-futuristic world building. As the other user pointed out, how protection system were so ignorant to the radiationI have played almost every game from this franchise and even they were not so idiotic in some moments. Also I was really happy to see that they gave a role to Ron Perlman, who is a voiceover veteran in this franchise.	keep style game music unfortunately keep bethesda tradition poor uninspire dialogue tv series clearly make game fan much intro world build background fraction moment look unrealistic unlogical even fallout retro futuristic world build user point protection system ignorant radiationi play almost every game franchise even idiotic moment also really happy see give role ron perlman voiceover veteran franchise

Tom may be ""less moral"" than an average person in some respects, but he's also deeply moral in his own way. More moral in hard circumstances than majority of people would be.And Wenders' film also shows that you don't have to go B&W to ""have atmosphere"", his richly colored Ripley movie is brimming with it.

1	First I'm glad the major networks are investing in SciFi which has been a backwater for the last couple decades. I also think this is the best SciFi television show since Westwood S1/Expanse S1,S2.I loved the premise, especially the first few episodes. Unfortunately the show gets gummed up in the later half by spending too much time on the characters, odd priorities for the characters, and not spending enough time on backstory.For example, why can't the San-Ti use their protons to start wiping out people they don't like instead of using half-baked assassins? They can control every television screen on the planet and impact machinery (I think), so why not start crashing planes of anyone they want dead. Why not start killing more scientists? There might be answers to these but the show does a super poor job of explaining the backstory.I also had a hard time following character incentives and decisions, they were so moody and mopey for the fate of humankind to be on the line.The show is at its best either when having action go down or getting into human nature. I loved the judgement day ship episode precisely because it was so uncomfortable and welded SciFi with painful morality decisions.Finally, I wish D&D had written every episode instead of just half the show. If there is a season 2 they really need to keep their foot on the gas and not outsource any of the writing, this season felt disjointed at times and lacked a lot of backstory and hand-holding for SciFi.Overall enjoyed it and hope more is coming.	first glad major network invest scifi backwater last couple decade also think good scifi television show since westwood expanse love premise especially first episode unfortunately show get gum later half spend much time character odd priority character spend enough time backstory example san ti use proton start wipe people like instead use half bake assassin control every television screen planet impact machinery think start crash plan anyone want dead start kill scientist might answer show super poor job explain backstory also hard time follow character incentive decision moody mopey fate humankind line show well either action go get human nature love judgement day ship episode precisely uncomfortable weld scifi painful morality decision finally wish write every episode instead half show season really need keep foot gas outsource write season feel disjoint time lack lot backstory hand hold scifi overall enjoy hope come

2	I have to say, I think Grey's Anatomy was and is probably my favorite television show. It started as just a show to be interested in, but it evolved, characters grew, a large part of the show focused on right or wrong, which is something I focus on a lot in life. But now watching the last few episodes, I can guarantee I will cry during each one. I'm seeing the characters I watched grow from residents to Harper-Avery Award recipients, get married, have kids, lose friends and family, face almost every adversity someone like myself pictures themselves going through- and I'm not even on the same career path. I've seen how hard one has to work to achieve what they want, and the sacrifices they made along the way. The Office was my favorite, but it lacked the perfect ending and the complete character development this show provided. I got very attached, and will miss this show with all my heart!	say think grey anatomy probably favorite television show start show interest evolve character grow large part show focus right wrong something focus lot life watch last episode guarantee cry one see character watch grow resident harper avery award recipient get marry kid lose friend family face almost every adversity someone like picture go even career path see hard one work achieve want sacrifice make along way office favorite lack perfect end complete character development show provide get attach miss show heart
0	I completely understand how this was greenlit. On paper it sounds great, but in practice it's as if chat-gpt wrote a detective story using the Save the Cat template, incorporating all the 'elements' of old school noir but none of the charm or skill in execution. They try REALLY hard to make the lead likeable, having him 'save' many a stray, but it comes off so awkward and forced. Instead of clues, you get drugged out montages, flashbacks and fake outs. Instead of classic noir dialogue exchanges, you get these weird accusatory standoffs.This looks like it cost a lot of money, it's a shame they didn't spend any of it on the actual writing of a story.The cast does look great, so there's that at least...I guess.	completely understand greenlit paper sound great practice chat gpt write detective story use save cat template incorporate element old school noir none charm skill execution try really hard make lead likeable save many stray come awkward force instead clue get drug montage flashback fake out instead classic noir dialogue exchange get weird accusatory standoff look like cost lot money shame spend actual write story cast look great least guess
2	"The book? Never read it. So I can neither recommend nor pan this as an adaptation. I take it as it gives itself which in impressive ways is spectacular. Visuals, especially in-game are something to behold. The story, long though it develop, is filled with twists you probably couldn't anticipate but they aren't introduced simply to snap your head. The story, as it develops presents vexing problems that are solved (or solved for now) unconventionally by individuals with unlikely but preparatory interests or expertise, so, however out there, bizarre solutions seem obviously the right thing to do. Even though, it turns out, nothing can be undertaken that isn't already anticipated. The enemy (I'll here not give them away) immediately knows every decision made by anybody so no action taken can be a surprise. But it turns out humans aren't entirely without recourse in the face of seemingly all-knowing ""whatever they are"" things. If I find fault, it's the casting on the whole. Rather drab but there are standouts. Benedict Wong as a rumpled agent of a security agency is very good. And I just have an affection for Liam Cunningham who here plays the "" He's very bad. He's very good"" boss of earth's opposition and so every character's challenge to think beyond themselves or fail or quit or act exasperated. All in all, these initial eight episodes entertain emotionally and exercise the old brain too."	book never read neither recommend pan adaptation take give impressive way spectacular visual especially game something behold story long though develop fill twist probably anticipate introduce simply snap head story develop present vex problem solve solve unconventionally individual unlikely preparatory interest expertise however bizarre solution seem obviously right thing even though turn nothing undertake already anticipate enemy give away immediately know every decision make anybody action take surprise turn human entirely without recourse face seemingly know whatever thing find fault cast whole rather drab standout benedict wong rumple agent security agency good affection liam cunningham play bad good boss earth opposition every character challenge think beyond fail quit act exasperate initial eight episode entertain emotionally exercise old brain
1	I'm rewatching the whole show at the moment.I really love the first few seasons 1-4, and like the seasons 5-7/8.After that just too many of the main characters left/died. There are not many left to like. I'm still not over Derek's Death and liked Lexie's Character very much as well. And I always was a fan of Meredith. She was this flawed character I could empathise with.Some charachters have a lot of depth and the show doesn't mind tackling heavy subjects. The acting and drama in this show is outstanding. Some episodes will blow your mind. Sandra Oh's acting was always fantastic, Christina was by far the best character. I wished they had stopped after she left.In the latest season it's all about political correctes though, which I usually don't mind, but it's just too much. I always thought the show handled subjects like racism, sexism, diversity etc. Very well.Give it a try. It's good entertainment (but don't get stuck on the realism of the portrayal of medicine)	rewatche whole show moment really love first season like season many main character leave die many leave like still derek death like lexie character much well always fan meredith flaw character could empathise charachter lot depth show mind tackle heavy subject act drama show outstanding episode blow mind sandra oh act always fantastic christina far good character wish stop leave late season political correct though usually mind much always think show handle subject like racism sexism diversity etc well give try good entertainment get stick realism portrayal medicine

0	"As a big fan of ""The Three-Body Problem"" books, I was really looking forward to Netflix's adaptation. The books stand out because they don't have clear-cut heroes or villains - it's all about people navigating complex situations.However, the Netflix series seems to have missed that subtlety. It quickly sets up a clear divide between good and evil, losing the nuanced character motivations that are central to the books. It's a bit disappointing to see the story's moral complexities smoothed over like this.Also, setting the series in London feels like a missed opportunity. The book's global perspective is one of its strengths, emphasizing a united human response to an extraterrestrial threat. By narrowing the focus to one city, particularly a Western one, the show loses some of the original's universal appeal.In short, while the Netflix series might be entertaining on its own, it doesn't fully capture the spirit of the books. It's a more straightforward interpretation, which might not satisfy those who appreciated the original's depth and global scale."	big fan three body problem book really look forward netflix adaptation book stand clear cut hero villain people navigate complex situation however netflix series seem miss subtlety quickly set clear divide good evil lose nuance character motivation central book bite disappoint see story moral complexity smooth like also set series london feel like miss opportunity book global perspective one strength emphasize unite human response extraterrestrial threat narrow focus one city particularly western one show lose original universal appeal short netflix series might entertain fully capture spirit book straightforward interpretation might satisfy appreciate original depth global scale
0	I've read many of the 10/10, 9/10 reviews, and I beg to differ. While the visuals are strong, the changes made to the book's story are not an improvement on the book. This version makes it hard for me to follow the story, and this telling sheds little light on the vast cultural differences between Japan & Europe that the book and 1980 version capture so well.The actor playing Blackthorne seems like a caricature. It's hard to imagine someone like him actually being accepted into the Japanese fold. The actor playing the Portuguese pilot doesn't work, as well as the actor who played the 1st priest Blackthorne encounters. I was hoping for a much more insightful take on the story, 40 some years after the 1st production, with the technology and cultural discernment available these days.	read many review beg differ visual strong change make book story improvement book version make hard follow story tell shed little light vast cultural difference japan europe book version capture well actor play blackthorne seem like caricature hard imagine someone like actually accept japanese fold actor play portuguese pilot work well actor play st priest blackthorne encounter hop much insightful take story year st production technology cultural discernment available day

Usually we root for the main character but I just wanted to shake him at every turn.He was a grown man with free will and of a sane mind but he said was groomed. He had prior experience of the guy's perversion and continued to see him in the process disrespecting his girlfriend and her mother and risking his home. Why report only the female offender to the police? The guy he met did worse, but he kept quiet for what? Money, fame or opportunities? Felt misogyny was at play with many of his actions, using and only holding women to account for their actions, allowing all the men in his life a free pass to continue to rape, keep a pub licence after lock-ins drug use, violence etc.The stalker was by far the best actress in it.Won't be interested in anything this 'comedian' has to offer in future.	often series turn stomach many episode none character come look normal likeable relatable usually root main character want shake every turn grow man free sane mind say groom prior experience guy perversion continue see process disrespect girlfriend mother risk home report female offender police guy meet bad keep quiet money fame opportunity feel misogyny play many action use hold woman account action allow man life free pass continue rape keep pub licence lock in drug use violence etc stalker far good actress interest anything comedian offer future

Basically, I have not watched the older version.So the story is about deception and the shooting places are awe striking. The scenery and art itself are enough to leave us spellbound and the former is cherished by a black&white filming. The series presents a poor but determinant Ripley who goes to Italy by the aim of bringing his employer's son and it is here that story starts.The series is beautiful and there are very few things you can complain about. (For now I have none). Additionally, the goods are in abundance. Whether it be a magnificently aligned story with Caravaggio or provoking confusions such as killing Marge(Not a spoiler, you will know what I mean when you watch it) or the dialogues.

They don't even show or mention it so the viewer has no idea why things are as they are. It jumps about at a chaotic pace almost like my review.

And Bailey, Ms. I can do it all, except act her way out of a paper bag. Awful, annoying character. And seriously, what have they done to Chen's character anyway? She deserves better. And STOP with that way-too-loud cringe-worthy music that you insist on playing along with ACTUAL DIALOGUE. It's unnecessary and distracting.	really rookie graduate become go guy work terrific character mesh nicely st season become secondary mighty falter fillion bailey ms except act way paper bag awful annoy character seriously do chen character anyway deserve well stop way loud cringe worthy music insist play along actual dialogue unnecessary distract
1	I had only watched the Matt Damon film for the first time a couple months ago and loved it for it's interesting characters and tension building. I'm a fan of Andrew Scott from his role as Moriarty in Sherlock and thought that Tom Ripley seemed right up his alley. I was looking forward to seeing what a mini series could do with the story given it would have so much extra time.Therein lies my first issue with the series, for all the extra time it has it I don't really feel that there was all that much more substance to the story. The main points of the film are repeated (at least in the first two thirds) and any of the additional points the series has over the film don't amount to much (With the exception of the expansion of the detectives role who's performance I enjoyed). It simply moves at a very slow pace with a lot of artsy shots and long takes which are nice but again don't add much.I also didn't really feel that any of the main members of the cast were distinctly better than their counterparts in the film. That's not to say they were bad but I definitely prefer the portrayal of the characters in the film.Part of this I believe is also down to what I felt was sometimes quite awkward dialogue. I didn't buy the Tom / Dickie friendship at all and some scenes seemed entirely out of character or people would do stupid things that make little sense.Ultimately I'd be interested to know how someone who hasn't seen anything Ripley before perceives the show. For me it was fine but I'd certainly recommend people watch the film over this show. I did appreciate the final scene of the show which I think was a brilliant moment in an otherwise often dull or dragging viewing experience.	watch matt damon film first time couple month ago love interest character tension build fan andrew scott role moriarty sherlock think tom ripley seem right alley look forward see mini series could story give would much extra time therein lie first issue series extra time really feel much substance story main point film repeat least first two third additional point series film amount much exception expansion detective role performance enjoy simply move slow pace lot artsy shot long take nice add much also really feel main member cast distinctly well counterpart film say bad definitely prefer portrayal character film part believe also feel sometimes quite awkward dialogue buy tom dickie friendship scene seem entirely character people would stupid thing make little sense ultimately interest know someone see anything ripley perceive show fine certainly recommend people watch film show appreciate final scene show think brilliant moment otherwise often dull drag view experience

0	Had to go from 3 to 1 stars bc after I finished the very long Chinese POV, these two should never again mention GoT, EVER EVER EVER. I knew the two DBs would blow it and I didn't even read the book and only cuatro episodes in. The two female leads, I mean where are they getting all these noBodies; it felt amateurish. I can care less if characters in the book are flat, movies need to take you for a ride but once I heard that female 'Lord' character, I knew more bull crap was coming. As soon as the homosexuality was presented, I just sighed and moved on. Red China should have been gloomier and not just a 10 minute business. I cannot even believe this was a crowned sci-fi novel to begin with. I'm going to skip to the eight episode and see if it's worth watching. An advice to the wonder boys --Gone are days of GoT! Welcome to mediocrity....you should have gotten better actors, the ones that know how to play the scene...people whose art it has been for centuries...the story itself is just how can I say it without being offensive...it's like outsiders looking inside, that wrote it, but really not getting the source of why it is the insiders are they way they are. I'm still shocked at how mediocre it is bc even the wonder boys used their names to tout it and it in advertisements and I was excited but once I new few more details I knew it would just NOT BE. But the real problem is the end of the world theme...I don't know how this book plays out but movies will never succeed in this area bc man simply doesn't get God. At times I felt like it was referencing how God acts with human...knows every detail about us, like their Sophons(so), very God like attributes but they are the enemy. I feel like man is trying to say something...they hate God! They drop Christ's name in vain and so this goes down as another underwhelming end of the world story! Yes the end is here...thank God!!!	go star bc finish long chinese pov two never mention get ever ever ever know two dbs would blow even read book cuatro episode two female lead mean get nobody feel amateurish care less character book flat movie need take ride hear female lord character know bull crap come soon homosexuality present sigh move red china gloomy minute business even believe crown sci fi novel begin go skip eight episode see worth watch advice wonder boy go day get welcome mediocrity get well actor one know play scene people whose art century story say without offensive like outsider look inside write really get source insider way still shock mediocre bc even wonder boy use name tout advertisement excite new detail know would real problem end world theme know book play movie never succeed area bc man simply get god time feel like reference god act human know every detail we like sophon god like attribute enemy feel like man try say something hate god drop christ name vain go another underwhelme end world story yes end thank god
1	"This show is very good and dont get me wrong with the title. I did personally enjoy the show a lot however what kept me from giving the show a higher score was the amount of story decisions they made too fit the games.The way I see it there are positve and negative aspects to creating a complete original story based on the propertiy of Fallout and I will explain my reasoning.(Also for refrence I am a big Fallout fan and have played all Fallout game entries)The positives of making an original story is that it is a lot more engaging too watch. If they had just adapted Fallout 1 I wouldnt have been shocked at all over the ending or been as engaged in the show tho of course that is really hard to say so take that opinion with a grain of salt. The point is you have the ability to tell a completely new and original story set in the universe which is a good thing.All the references are really neat and its fun too hear the stimpack sound effect or hear the quest clear marker when you reach a location. But some things were a bit cringe like the use of the famous line ""War never changes"", which just felt really shoehorned in near the end.The horror aspect is also something I am very confused by as none of the mainline entry games focus on the horror aspect. However as a tv show I get that adapting the source material and interpreting it in such a way isnt necessarily a bad thing just very unique.The bad parts come when discussing the story of the show. There is a lot of focus on cold fusion and the politics of vault-tec which is something that again, none of the mainline fallout games focus on and the whole concept of cold fusion is never mentioned in any of the Fallout games. Fallout 3 might have the biggest influence on the show since the whole concept of Lucy going out to save her dad is taken from the game. Which I dont like because Fallout 3 easily has the worst story ever.The NCR are poorly written and their backstory is quite interesting dating back to fallout 1 and 2 which gets thrown out the window here. New Vegas gets no love as well only showing the strip in the absolute end of the last episode which just seems like they are hyping it up for season 2 so we'll see where that takes us. Apart from that no ceasars legion, no supermutants (in fact the show never even mentions them) but the biggest offense might be the enclave. The enclave are the main villains of Fallouts 2 and 3 and they are featured a little in Fallout 1 as well but here they have practically no impact on the story. Just that the scientist guy escaped from the enclave which might be an allusion to a scientist from Fallout 2 actually, but thats beside the point. They are basically not important too the story whatsoever in fact the brotherhood of steel are the only faction that are featured prominently in the show. Which is a bit of a weird decision since there are many factions that could have made it in. New reno gangs, Vault city, all the factions from san franciso arent mentioned like the hubologists and no fallout 4 factions like railroad or the synths. Brotherhood and enclave are pretty much in all Fallout games so I guess it made sense to mention those but cmon. There is also no GECK but storywise I can understand why you wouldnt want to mention it (Its basically the equivilent of cold fusion in the show).Overall some creative decisions werent my favourite tho I enjoyed the show a lot and wheter it was a ""faithful adaptation"" is up to interpretation. On one hand it was simply adapting the universe which it did fairly well, but on the other the factions, the characters the locations are changed to fit the new creative narrative of the show which is a bit of a shame in my opinion. I think the show would have benifited from adapting more of Fallout 1 and 2, rather than 3 and 4 if that makes sense.I cant wait for season 2 tho and I will definitely come back for more!"	show good do not get wrong title personally enjoy show lot however keep give show high score amount story decision make fit game way see positve negative aspect create complete original story base propertiy fallout explain reason also refrence big fallout fan play fallout game entry positive make original story lot engage watch adapt fallout would not shock end engage show tho course really hard say take opinion grain salt point ability tell completely new original story set universe good thing reference really neat fun hear stimpack sound effect hear quest clear marker reach location thing bite cringe like use famous line war never change feel really shoehorn near end horror aspect also something confuse none mainline entry game focus horror aspect however tv show get adapt source material interpret way be not necessarily bad thing unique bad part come discuss story show lot focus cold fusion politic vault tec something none mainline fallout game focus whole concept cold fusion never mention fallout game fallout might big influence show since whole concept lucy go save dad take game do not like fallout easily bad story ever ncr poorly write backstory quite interest date back fallout get throw window new vegas get love well show strip absolute end last episode seem like hype season see take we apart ceasars legion supermutant fact show never even mention big offense might enclave enclave main villain fallout feature little fallout well practically impact story scientist guy escape enclave might allusion scientist fallout actually that s beside point basically important story whatsoever fact brotherhood steel faction feature prominently show bite weird decision since many faction could make new reno gang vault city faction san franciso be not mention like hubologist fallout faction like railroad synth brotherhood enclave pretty much fallout game guess make sense mention cmon also geck storywise understand would not want mention basically equivilent cold fusion show overall creative decision be not favourite tho enjoy show lot wheter faithful adaptation interpretation one hand simply adapt universe fairly well faction character location change fit new creative narrative show bite shame opinion think show would benifited adapt fallout rather make sense can not wait season tho definitely come back
2	Season 1-6 were easily 10s, best series I've ever watched. Season 7 was way to sped up and they lost the magic that was game if thrones, I'd give it a 7. Season 8 is down right terrible, I'd give it a 4 or t. SPOILERS. For how great this series was this was the worst ending imaginable. Bad dialogue, no explanations, far fewer conspiracies in a back room, and every main character is invincible vs the other soldiers who die immediately. Great war was everything but. The last war was garbage. Can't wait for Martin to finish the series so I can see how it really ends cause this isn't it.	season easily good series ever watch season way speed lose magic game throne give season right terrible give spoiler great series bad end imaginable bad dialogue explanation far few conspiracy back room every main character invincible vs soldier die immediately great war everything last war garbage wait martin finish series see really end cause

1	I understand this is set on a video computer game from the late 90's. I watched the first episode and thought what a load of complete rubbish. But fate intervened. The next day it bucketed of rain so I thought let's endure the next 7 episodes. As it turns out it's a good yarn. Not as bloody as I was led to believe but those bits were obviously from the shoot me up game. The interesting bit for me was to see what transgresses with the vaults. How they came about . In that I think it could have been completed in two episodes. There was a bit of fallow humour. The parallels with the modern MIC was very good. A few messages that may have gone completely over the head of a less mature audience. (As in age). I liked the retro 50's look at times and I'm assuming it's an alternative universe but maybe I'm looking too deep. The ending was too obvious for me and in fact I guessed the premise from episode 1 when the father, Kyle MacLachlan gets kidnapped. However it was better than I suspected. It seems the fanboys of the game are divided on the film series. If like me you've never played the game or ever intend playing the game it'll be worth a watch.	understand set video computer game late watch first episode think load complete rubbish fate intervene next day bucket rain think let endure next episode turn good yarn bloody lead believe bit obviously shoot game interest bite see transgress vault come think could complete two episode bite fallow humour parallel modern mic good message may go completely head less mature audience age like retro look time assume alternative universe maybe look deep end obvious fact guess premise episode father kyle maclachlan get kidnap however well suspect seem fanboy game divide film series like never play game ever intend play game worth watch
2	I read the book and yes, it's amazing! But I have zero qualms about the tv show trimming down some of the fat and adjusting things for the screen version. Expecting anything else is just childish.We live in an age where majority of tv shows barely make it to season 2, so of course the writers are moving things along at an accelerated pace. They do not have the luxury of unlimited page numbers, especially considering the season 1 is only eight episodes long.With that said, I found the show to be extremely well produced, with top notch visuals and excellent and engaging storytelling. The cast is for the most part a good fit for their characters, with Asian actors especially standing out in their performances, which will definitively appeal to the audiences in the east.What I really liked is the world building. We get an incredibly vivid sense of the world and jumping between Asia, Europe and USA, definitively helps appreciate the scale and gravity of the events unfolding. At moments it feels as if we're watching a global blockbuster movie.A lot of the philosophycal and existential questions are posed and if you enjoy your brain getting tickled by large topics, this will be very enjoyable.	read book yes amaze zero qualm tv show trim fat adjust thing screen version expect anything else childish live age majority tv show barely make season course writer move thing along accelerate pace luxury unlimited page number especially consider season eight episode long say find show extremely well produce top notch visual excellent engage storytelling cast part good fit character asian actor especially stand performance definitively appeal audience east really like world build get incredibly vivid sense world jump asia europe usa definitively help appreciate scale gravity event unfold moment feel watch global blockbuster movie lot philosophycal existential question pose enjoy brain get tickle large topic enjoyable
1	My girlfriend and her friends love this show, making sure to queue up every episode on the TiVo as to not miss a minute of it. So I thought I'd check it out; see what all the commotion was about. Lucky for me, ABC is streaming the latest season on their site.I started with the season premiere. 15 minutes in and I'm already having a hard time paying attention, let alone taking it seriously. Then I'm thinking maybe it's not supposed to be serious, but soon I realize the comedy is so weak and cliché I quickly switch shows. Luckily, ABC's got a great lineup: Ugly Betty (hilarious, fresh, knows its audience), The Nine (dramatic, suspenseful, sincere), and Six Degrees (at least tries to be entertaining while maintaining respect for its audience).After exhausting all my options and completely catching up on the entire ABC lineup, I grudgingly return to Grey's anatomy, honestly hoping to be surprised by the time I finish the third episode.Here's the thing: I find most of the cast completely shallow and Uninteresting.I find it incredibly annoying that the bulk of the show is comprised of Dr. Grey's romance between two guys who aren't even an ounce as Charming, brilliant, and through-provoking as any of the male cast of ER. OK, the show is named after her, but I can't help but think she's trying to do what ally McBeal already did extremely well. (And Sex & The City while I'm at it.) That act is very hard to follow.The rest of the cast are clowns; bimbos and dopes who belong on a Daytime sitcom. It's like saved by the bell meets days of our lives. Are we really expected to believe any medicine is being practiced here? At least with scrubs we knew they were off the wall and completely unserious (until it mattered). With Grey's anatomy, we have a loosely Ad-libbed (romantic?) Comedy filled with sporadic moments of drama that Are so forced they're unbelievable to the point of insincere.I like Chandra Wilson and Katherine Heigl. They're great. They're a Good fit. Sara Ramirez is great to watch, but her character is just ridiculous. Sandra Oh is embarrassing. Patrick Dempsey could be better utilized. T.R. Night definitely needs to go.You're better off watching the rest of the ABC lineup. Better yet, watch ER reruns and see what a real show is like.	girlfriend friend love show make sure queue every episode tivo miss minute think check see commotion lucky abc stream late season site start season premiere minute already hard time pay attention let alone take seriously think maybe suppose serious soon realize comedy weak clich quickly switch show luckily abc get great lineup ugly betty hilarious fresh know audience nine dramatic suspenseful sincere six degree least try entertain maintain respect audience exhaust option completely catch entire abc lineup grudgingly return grey anatomy honestly hop surprise time finish third episode thing find cast completely shallow uninteresting find incredibly annoy bulk show comprise dr grey romance two guy even ounce charm brilliant provoke male cast er ok show name help think try ally mcbeal already extremely well sex city act hard follow rest cast clown bimbos dope belong daytime sitcom like save bell meet day live really expect believe medicine practice least scrub know wall completely unserious matter grey anatomy loosely ad libbe romantic comedy fill sporadic moment drama force unbelievable point insincere like chandra wilson katherine heigl great good fit sara ramirez great watch character ridiculous sandra oh embarrass patrick dempsey could well utilize r night definitely need go well watch rest abc lineup well yet watch er rerun see real show like
2	Its one thing to watch a show knowing that its tough but when it's based on real events its messed up on so many levels.Nonetheless, I totally recommend it, as its -in my opinion- the most accurate way of describing a healing process of abuse. Well, not fully.The show itself is incredibly written and acted, its so distressing to the point I couldn't believe that the main actor Richard Gadd is the one who all these things happened to so reliving your trauma and make a whole show about it is so strong!Well you be uncomfortable watching it? Yes. Well it overwhelm you? Yes! But its a must watch to actually understand some mental health issues or people who've been abused or stalked!	one thing watch show know tough base real event mess many level nonetheless totally recommend opinion accurate way describe heal process abuse well fully show incredibly write act distress point believe main actor richard gadd one thing happen relive trauma make whole show strong well uncomfortable watch yes well overwhelm yes must watch actually understand mental health issue people abuse stalk

1	This show is Hollywood nonsense. The storyline is difficult to follow thanks to an over-abundance of poorly crafted noirish melodrama combined with camera work reminiscent of a stoner who has watched too many Tarantino films but didn't pay attention in film school to pull of more than a late-night infomercial. It kind of reminds me of an attempt to copy Fesr and Loathing without the drug references that let the viewer know why they're seeing camera blurs, light flashes and whatnot. I mean, is the lead character high?At one point, a body is found. Apparently, it had been stuffed in this spot where people come and go day and night. Bodies stink incredibly. Yet nobody had noticed.Suffice to say that I won't be watching. In fact, it's time to cancel AppleTV. They're just not producing quality programs.	show hollywood nonsense storyline difficult follow thank abundance poorly craft noirish melodrama combine camera work reminiscent stoner watch many tarantino film pay attention film school pull late night infomercial kind remind attempt copy fesr loathe without drug reference let viewer know see camera blur light flash whatnot mean lead character high one point body find apparently stuff spot people come go day night body stink incredibly yet nobody notice suffice say watch fact time cancel appletv produce quality program

2	I am in awe of how creative Richard Gadd is. He truly impressed me, and after having read/watched about his other projects I have immense respect for his art. I'm also impressed by how brave and vunerable he is to share so much of his life. Jessica Gunning was incredible in this! She made me feel so many emotions, outstanding acting. I like how creative this show is, it feels like a play at times, which is no surprise considering Gadd's background, but that's what elevates it to art. It is truly hard to watch at times especially when Donny makes the worst decisions possible, but it truly shows how hard trauma and self-loathing is to overcome. It's brilliantly written, and Gadd's performance is incredible as well.	awe creative richard gadd truly impress read watch project immense respect art also impress brave vunerable share much life jessica gun incredible make feel many emotion outstanding act like creative show feel like play time surprise consider gadd background elevate art truly hard watch time especially donny make bad decision possible truly show hard trauma self loathe overcome brilliantly write gadd performance incredible well

First, the batteries wouldn't last that long. They are used on calls and traffic stops or when the officer thinks it's needed. Facial hair, unless it's a mustache, is not allowed. When Nolan shot the perp in the left, he would have spent the rest of the shift in IA for a shooting review. No 3 day growth and especially not chin hair like on the black supervisor. Lastly, the black rookie would have been fired for freezing the way he did. Period. I could go on but you get the idea.

So they broke up.Then they want to put her with Bradford another disaster's career move. Then they waste screen time to figure out on how it would be ok and not a conflict with their duties at work to put them together. And Nolan choosing to be a Training Officer right after being a rookie. WTF. I would rather have someone seasoned who give more advice on different situations.

Can someone please explain to me how exactly Johnny Flynn AND Andrew Scott both managed to be completely charmless? I feel like that would take monumental effort from both of them. This felt like I was watching a suicidally depressed Wes Anderson directing a bored cast high on quaaludes in an art-house film. Was it very pretty? Sure. Did I absolutely loathe my once-favourite character from the Ripley saga (Freddie Miles)? Yup. Why did they cast a woman to play a man's role? Is this reverse Shakespeare? Where were the homoerotic undertones? What is happening?!? Positives: the Italian cast members were all fantastic, and every scene was beautifully manicured and framed. Sigh.	nope would wealthy man want pay smarmy year old stranger lot money go get year old son someone please explain exactly johnny flynn andrew scott manage completely charmless feel like would take monumental effort feel like watch suicidally depress wes anderson direct bore cast high quaalude art house film pretty sure absolutely loathe favourite character ripley saga freddie mile yup cast woman play man role reverse shakespeare homoerotic undertone happen positive italian cast member fantastic every scene beautifully manicure frame sigh
0	The Rookie is one of many TV series with an interesting premise but poor follow through. The recent episode where armed robber suspects were unhandcuffed so one could propose to the other is when the Rookie jumped the shark. In earlier episodes, the training officers worked hard to correct every mistake, but in this scene the TO was an eager participant. Make no mistake, this incident would have a strong impact on the career of everyone involved. No police officer would uncuff one hand of a suspect and leave the open cuff dangling. That loose cuff is a deadly weapon.	rookie one many tv series interest premise poor follow recent episode arm robber suspect unhandcuffed one could propose rookie jump shark early episode train officer work hard correct every mistake scene eager participant make mistake incident would strong impact career everyone involve police officer would uncuff one hand suspect leave open cuff dangle loose cuff deadly weapon
2	This show is damn near perfect.Yes, I agree that the eighth season was not the best, and was by far the worst of them all, but people seem to love to forget that up until the final season, David and Dan gave us one of the most popular, most critically acclaimed, and most respected TV shows ever.The acting was always brilliant. Even in the face of bad lines or story beats, the actors in this series make it work as best they can, and they do it very well. The casting was done so well that to a lot of people, these characters are inseparable from they actor they are portrayed by. As someone who has read the books as well as watched the show, I can confirm this.90% of the time, the writing was brilliant and perfect. The writers created a story that, while being a retelling of a famous book of the same name, had its own unique twists and turns, and captivated millions of people worldwide for nearly a decade. That's nothing to scoff at. That's very impressive.Cinematography, special effects, editing, directing, and all of the other things that make for a great show are done masterfully the whole way through. You just can't get enough of it. Even in the earlier days of the show, when the budget was much smaller, the team managed to make it engaging, entertaining, suspenseful, dramatic, and all-around spectacular. The score done by Ramin Djwadi is incredible and iconic. All these things carried over from season 1-8 (besides the significant drop in writing quality in the last season).Overall, this show is worth your time. I think that part of the reason so many people hated the final season was because, when you compare it to the previous seven, the writing took a major tumble. But if you look at it with an open mind, without the need to constantly compare and rank, it's an enjoyable season for the most part. But I agree that it's nothing compared to the ones that came before. Game Of Thrones came so close to being the greatest show in history, and just a bit more effort could have gotten it there.	show damn near perfect yes agree eighth season well far bad people seem love forget final season david dan give we one popular critically acclaim respect tv show ever act always brilliant even face bad line story beat actor series make work well well cast do well lot people character inseparable actor portray someone read book well watch show confirm time write brilliant perfect writer create story retell famous book name unique twist turn captivate million people worldwide nearly decade nothing scoff impressive cinematography special effect edit direct thing make great show do masterfully whole way get enough even early day show budget much small team manage make engage entertain suspenseful dramatic around spectacular score do ramin djwadi incredible iconic thing carry season besides significant drop write quality last season overall show worth time think part reason many people hat final season compare previous seven write take major tumble look open mind without need constantly compare rank enjoyable season part agree nothing compare one come game throne come close great show history bite effort could get
2	Seasons 1-4: 10/10 The first four seasons of GoT are not only the best seasons of television of all time, they rival cinema with regards to their epic storytelling and production values. They are brilliant adaptations of the first three books in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, staying largely faithful while making the necessary changes and even improving and enhancing the source material at certain points. There are so many incredible plot twists, character moments, dialogues and set pieces and it is never once boring or rushed.Best episodes: S1: Baelor S2: Blackwater S3: The Rains of Castamere S4: The Lion and the RoseS5: 7/10 Season 5 is the first season that disappointed me. Not that it was bad, but it was not up to par compared to the (admittedly very high) standard set by the previous four. The first six episodes are slow, and certain storylines such as the Dorne storyline were messy and not well handled. Barristan Selmy's death was stupid, pointless and totally out of character, and a clear sign of the shock-value-over-quality that would plague future seasons. Also, S5 marks the first real noticeable dip in the quality of the writing, as the dialogue was weaker and characterizations began to suffer a little. However, I must admit that this is true for books 4 and 5 as well. They were not nearly as strong as the previous three, and due to them being split geographically instead of narratively they were much harder to adapt. Even narratively they did not progress the story enough. Still, this does not excuse the mediocre writing of the TV season.The saving grace of S5 are the last four episodes, which were considerably better, moved things forward and contained some truly epic moments. The Hardhome episode was excellent and a great deviation from the source material, Cersei's conflict with the High Sparrow and her walk of shame was very well done, and the meeting between Tyrion and Daenerys was great. However, other storylines did suffer, most notably Stannis' entire storyline at Castle Black, which, apart from a brilliant scene where he burns his daughter as a sacrifice for the Lord of Light, ended up being pointless as he was killed off without at least giving us a proper battle. Also, Daenerys struggle with the Sons of the Harpy in Meereen was mostly boring, but then again her storyline was not much better in book 5.Overall, S5 was still a pretty decent season of television, but it was not nearly as satisfying as I was expecting.Best episode: HardhomeS6: 6/10 Season 6 was the first season not based on the ASOIAF books, and it showed. Although the season contained some epic moments, it unfortunately continued the downward spiral of the show's quality that began in S5. The season included a lot of payoff for storylines developed in earlier seasons and stuff set up by S5, but the writing was even worse than in the previous season and the show began to feel even less like the GoT of S1-4.The bad writing that began in S5 is even more noticeable here, as many characters make stupid and illogical decisions and a lot of subplots were rushed although most ended satisfyingly. Inconsistent and lazy writing, ridiculous scenes (such as Daenerys's entire sequence with the Dothraki and her burning down the temple, and House Dorne being overthrown in one simple short scene in the season premiere) and stupid off-screen deaths ensued. Arya's stint with the Faceless Men in Braavos ended poorly and gave us the first truly annoying use of plot armor. Hodor's big moment was fun and unexpected (if a bit random), but it did introduce the element of time travel which the show would completely ignore in the next two seasons. Battle of the Bastards was visually stunning and fun to watch but suffered from subpar writing and plot armor, and the Meereen subplot was resolved way to easily. But luckily, the season ended on a high note with the last episode, which started with the best set piece of the later seasons with Cersei blowing up the sept, and included the reveal of Jon's parentage (if only it would ultimately mean something). Thus, there were just enough epic moments and revelations to keep us mostly happy and excited for what's to come.Best episode: The Winds of WinterS7: 4/10 Season 7 was a crushing disappointment and gave me the first serious indication that my favorite show would likely end very poorly. The first sign was that there were only 13 episodes left over two seasons, which is way too little considering all the plots that needed to be resolved. Obviously, this would mean that the show runners would rush everything. The first episode was very weak and did not move the story forward at all, which was very odd considering there were only six episodes left in the season. The only real highlights in the season were Lady Olenna's final moments and the visually stunning Loot Train Attack sequence. Episode five completely ruined everything with the most idiotic plan ever conceived in the show (capturing a white walker), courtesy of Tyrion no less. Tyrion has become such a stupid character since he left Westeros, a shell of his former self who now just drinks and makes juvenile jokes. The Beyond the Wall episode was an illogical, poorly written mess with Marvel-esque action, plot armor, teleportation and contrived nonsense. The season finale was ruined by the ridiculous death of Littlefinger that was a betrayal of his character; only decent scene was Jaime leaving Cersei.Best episode: The Queen's JusticeS8: 2/10 I am not going in depth on S8, enough people have already done that and made analyses on the absolute dumpster fire this final season was. All I'm going to say is that S8 is a complete disaster, the most disappointing thing I've ever watched and one of the worst seasons of TV I've ever seen. It completely ruined the entire show and all its wonderful characters beyond repair and it crushed my heart and soul. The only reason it does not get a 1/10 is because of the hard work of the entire cast and crew who made sure the season at least looked as good as it did, sounded as well as it did, and was acted as strongly as possible, even in spite of the absolutely idiotic writing they had to deal with. What a shame.Best episode: A Knight of the Seven KingdomsIt could have been the greatest show ever made, but D&D unfortunately sabotaged their own show and disrespected George and the fans. All we can do now is hope the books will be finished one day, but considering it has been two and a half years since the show ended and book 6 is still nowhere in sight, I'm not optimistic we will ever get a proper ending.Overall rating: 7.4 (rounded up to 8 due to the sheer brilliance of S1-4)	season first four season get good season television time rival cinema regard epic storytelle production value brilliant adaptation first three book george r r martin song ice fire series stay largely faithful make necessary change even improve enhance source material certain point many incredible plot twist character moment dialogue set piece never bear rush good episode baelor blackwater rain castamere lion rose season first season disappoint bad par compare admittedly high standard set previous four first six episode slow certain storyline dorne storyline messy well handle barristan selmy death stupid pointless totally character clear sign shock value quality would plague future season also mark first real noticeable dip quality write dialogue weak characterization begin suffer little however must admit true book well nearly strong previous three due split geographically instead narratively much hard adapt even narratively progress story enough still excuse mediocre write tv season save grace last four episode considerably well move thing forward contain truly epic moment hardhome episode excellent great deviation source material cersei conflict high sparrow walk shame well do meet tyrion daenery great however storyline suffer notably stannis entire storyline castle black apart brilliant scene burn daughter sacrifice lord light end pointless kill without least give we proper battle also daenery struggle son harpy meereen mostly bore storyline much well book overall still pretty decent season television nearly satisfy expect good episode hardhome season first season base asoiaf book show although season contain epic moment unfortunately continue downward spiral show quality begin season include lot payoff storyline develop early season stuff set write even worse previous season show begin feel even less like get bad write begin even noticeable many character make stupid illogical decision lot subplot rush although end satisfyingly inconsistent lazy write ridiculous scene daenery entire sequence dothraki burn temple house dorne overthrow one simple short scene season premiere stupid screen death ensue arya stint faceless man braavos end poorly give we first truly annoy use plot armor hodor big moment fun unexpected bite random introduce element time travel show would completely ignore next two season battle bastard visually stun fun watch suffer subpar write plot armor meereen subplot resolve way easily luckily season end high note last episode start well set piece later season cersei blow sept include reveal jon parentage would ultimately mean something thus enough epic moment revelation keep we mostly happy excite come good episode wind winter season crush disappointment give first serious indication favorite show would likely end poorly first sign episode leave two season way little consider plot need resolve obviously would mean show runner would rush everything first episode weak move story forward odd consider six episode leave season real highlight season lady olenna final moment visually stun loot train attack sequence episode five completely ruin everything idiotic plan ever conceive show capture white walker courtesy tyrion less tyrion become stupid character since leave westeros shell former self drink make juvenile joke beyond wall episode illogical poorly write mess marvel esque action plot armor teleportation contrive nonsense season finale ruin ridiculous death littlefinger betrayal character decent scene jaime leave cersei good episode queen justice go depth enough people already do make analyse absolute dumpster fire final season go say complete disaster disappoint thing ever watch one bad season tv ever see completely ruin entire show wonderful character beyond repair crush heart soul reason get hard work entire cast crew make sure season least look good sound well act strongly possible even spite absolutely idiotic write deal shame good episode knight seven kingdomsit could greatest show ever make unfortunately sabotage show disrespect george fan hope book finish one day consider two half year since show end book still nowhere sight optimistic ever get proper end overall rat round due sheer brilliance

My teenagers loved this show but I am not allowing them to watch this trash. Trying to teach them unity instead of hate.

R. Martin for write this great story., and to Emilia Clarke just thank you for existing and being part of GOT.Thank you to all of you in Game of Thrones.	perhaps objective could even amaze series one stun tv show know future right possible probably good tv series get point comparison series like break bad homeland mad man sorry like series good get matter emmy say like believe already know emmy usually work benefit talk brake bad mad man also enjoy really good tv show also popular make objective make people like without risky controversial mature know get time hard watch people series make everyone make well show something like tv show epic savage crude surprisingly real human behavior course attach fantasy story dragon magic epic battle many secret discover literally correct adjective word describe english native language even loose objectivity rat great work people involve put series deserve less rate movie series rater website consider u give mean series capable rate aspect technical sound video edit mix direction cast actress actor story plot script every single aspect flawless piece work want say thank george r r martin write great story emilia clarke thank exist part get thank game throne
2	So much to admire and enjoy about this series!1. Much has already been written about the cinematography, and it is, to be sure, one of the most gorgeous works of cinema to appear in years. Significantly, the black and white approach is not only artistic, but it also powerfully reinforces a sense of a time (early 1960's) many decades removed from our present so it serves the story very well in that regard by conveying the sense of a clearly period piece.2. The acting is remarkably disciplined, and while the dialogue is beautifully crafted to enhance the sense of uneasiness and mistrust among the characters, it is sparse, so that the actors portray as much if not more with their unspoken expressions as they do with their lines. Very skillful performances from all.3. Direction and editing is refreshingly unhurried and is perfectly suited to the leisurely existence of people who have very little with which to occupy themselves. Lonliness and isolation make for slow times, and the pacing here reflects that reality, even though the series doesn't drag... it remains suspenseful and maintains one's interest as a result of the great craftsmanship.	much admire enjoy series much already write cinematography sure one gorgeous work cinema appear year significantly black white approach artistic also powerfully reinforce sense time early many decade remove present serve story well regard convey sense clearly period piece act remarkably discipline dialogue beautifully craft enhance sense uneasiness mistrust among character sparse actor portray much unspoken expression line skillful performance direction edit refreshingly unhurrie perfectly suit leisurely existence people little occupy lonliness isolation make slow time pace reflect reality even though series drag remain suspenseful maintain one interest result great craftsmanship

1	I've enjoyed watching the fantastic cast bring game of thrones to life. I have huge respect for all the actors for their portrayals of the characters, they have been brilliant. Seasons 1-6 were great... 7, ok, But season eight, the jewels on game of thrones' crown get written. As with everything in life, it could turn out any which way... and the writers decide to tie it up like they do. I feel for fans of the show that waited like I did for every season, every episode, but I am most of all bitterly disappointed for the cast who didn't get the conclusions they deserved.	enjoy watch fantastic cast bring game throne life huge respect actor portrayal character brilliant season great ok season eight jewel game throne crown get write everything life could turn way writer decide tie like feel fan show wait like every season every episode bitterly disappoint cast get conclusion deserve
0	This has been one of my favorite police dramas over the past couple of years. The acting and direction have been compelling and the plots well balanced. Turning the show into a social justice psychodrama has been severely damaging . One hopes it can get back to its roots and go from virtue signaling to riveting crime drama. Before this sharp swing to the left I would have given it a 9.	one favorite police drama past couple year act direction compel plot well balance turn show social justice psychodrama severely damage one hop get back root go virtue signal rivet crime drama sharp swing leave would give
2	But older and wiser than the stunning character he played in the perfect 10 Firefly. So, I am always honest in my ratings. I admit to adding two whole stars just to watch Nathan Fillion again in something a bit more serious and hard hitting than Castle. This is not a perfect show. But if you had to pick an actor to pull off a 40 something rookie in a police precinct, I'd START with Fillion and pray he'd take the role (which he did!).To be fair, the multi race cast of The Rookie are also fantastic. Sometimes when I watch a show that ticks off all of Hollywood's boxes (not necessarily the VIEWERS boxes, however), I can't watch it because it CAN come off a bit preachy. But Nathan Fillion is the Fred Astaire of the acting profession. He could act with a cardboard box and it would be wonderful. He mixes in just the right amount of hubris, humility and humor to make you fall in love with his character, John Nolan.However, all that being said, I must give a shout out to other fine actors who make up this ensemble cast, which despite Fillion's huge screen presence, also shine brightly in this show. Richard T. Jones plays Sargeant Wade Grey, a serious, skeptical but honorable head of the division the three rookies are in. In the beginning, he was sure Nolan would wash out within a week. As the episodes rolled on, a sort of mutual respect and friendship grows between them, a high five for BOTH actors for the ability to pull this off in such a slow, but very sweet fashion. The other two rookies and each of the three teaching partners are excellent in their roles and at times, even Fillion's story takes a second place to their stories.Great scripts, great directing (the seams of the show never fray even though each episode has a different director), beautiful Southern California scenery, cinematography, and a storyline that keeps advancing without missing any steps along the way. Watching these relationships change and grow as the season has gone on, is a pleasure. We watch a lot of shows. But there are only three we pick the night after it's recorded - The Resident, Criminal Minds, and The Rookie. (I want to add Manifest as well, even though the season has ended and we still have no idea if it will be picked up again - PLEASE PICK IT UP AGAIN?).With all of this, The Rookie still hasn't found its audience and the ratings are not as high as they should be. But I keep thinking back on NCIS - and even Criminal Minds - neither a blockbuster the first season. Back then, the producers and networks took a chance on a highly rated show as The Rookie, which currently is at 8.0 on IMDb's own rating system. The only thing I am wondering about is, what happens to the name of the show when he graduates to a full fledged police officer and is no longer a rookie? My sense is HE will be given a rookie to raise if it gets renewed (which I hope it does!).I am so sick of these networks dropping some of their greatest shows. Shows like Travelers (on Netflix - one of the best sci fi shows ever and idiot Netflix cancelled it after 3 seasons. WATCH IT!), The Pretender, Journeyman, Moonlight, Forever, Threshold, Intelligence, Frequency, AND FIREFLY, and so many others cancelled after the first season with ratings at 7 plus in IMDb! I am SO hoping these people who have broken my heart too many times to count will take a chance and renew The Rookie. There are now at least FOUR knock offs of This Is Us that are getting renewed with similar ratings. The Rookie is as good as a TV show gets and deserves another season! Of course, if more people would WATCH it, and not discover it in Netflix five years down the line (like I did with Firefly), then it would be renewed. So spread the word while we still have a chance. Highly recommended! A gem of a show that just needs a chance to grow!	old wise stun character play perfect firefly always honest rat admit add two whole star watch nathan fillion something bite serious hard hit castle perfect show pick actor pull something rookie police precinct start fillion pray take role fair multi race cast rookie also fantastic sometimes watch show tick hollywood box necessarily viewers box however watch come bite preachy nathan fillion fred astaire act profession could act cardboard box would wonderful mix right amount hubris humility humor make fall love character john nolan however say must give shout fine actor make ensemble cast despite fillion huge screen presence also shine brightly show richard jones play sargeant wade grey serious skeptical honorable head division three rookie begin sure nolan would wash within week episode roll sort mutual respect friendship grow high five actor ability pull slow sweet fashion two rookie three teach partner excellent role time even fillion story take second place story great script great direct seam show never fray even though episode different director beautiful southern california scenery cinematography storyline keep advance without miss step along way watch relationship change grow season go pleasure watch lot show three pick night record resident criminal mind rookie want add manifest well even though season end still idea pick please pick rookie still find audience rat high keep think back ncis even criminal mind neither blockbuster first season back producer network take chance highly rat show rookie currently imdb rat system thing wonder happen name show graduate full fledge police officer long rookie sense give rookie raise get renew hope sick network drop great show show like traveler netflix one good sci fi show ever idiot netflix cancel season watch pretender journeyman moonlight forever threshold intelligence frequency firefly many other cancel first season rat plus imdb hop people break heart many time count take chance renew rookie least four knock off we get renew similar rat rookie good tv show get deserve another season course people would watch discover netflix five year line like firefly would renew spread word still chance highly recommend gem show need chance grow
0	As the title states, he speaks English not Portuguese. Along all the first episode the so called translators were tasked to translate Portuguese to Japanese, but the pilot (John) speaks English. Cannot understand why such a minor detail went unnoticed. Having that said, I couldn't continue watching as it was very disappointing that something so obvious wouldn't care for the producers. It's like insulting people's intelligence. If you manage to ignore and overcome that you might enjoy the series. It doesn't look so bad, but it's not amazing. I've got to watch the old though, based on some other reviews.	title state speak english portuguese along first episode call translator task translate portuguese japanese pilot john speak english understand minor detail go unnoticed say continue watch disappoint something obvious care producer like insult people intelligence manage ignore overcome might enjoy series look bad amaze get watch old though base review
2	"This is a truly stunning production.I was a little unsure about the black and white cinematography, I felt that we wouldn't get the full beauty of Italy, but you know, it really does work. It gives the film a real feel of the era it which it's set, and a somewhat menacing atmosphere.Andrew Scott, as always is sublime, he really does portray the troubled psychopath Tom Ripley so we almost feel empathy for him.My only criticism is that the casting is a little ""off"" Dakota Fanning seems terribly miscast as Marge Sherwood, she looks disinterested at best, Johnny Flynn gave us a good interpretation of the spoilt Dickie Greenleaf, but there was very little on screen chemistry between him and Dakota.My main issue with casting is that of Eliot Sumner as Freddie Miles. I totally understand why they were chosen for the role, but I personally don't think it was the right decision. Apart from questionable acting abilities, they just didn't seem to portray the arrogant, privilege and snobbiness of Freddie.Definitely watch it, it's well worth the time you will give it."	truly stun production little unsure black white cinematography feel get full beauty italy know really work give film real feel era set somewhat menace atmosphere andrew scott always sublime really portray trouble psychopath tom ripley almost feel empathy criticism cast little dakota fan seem terribly miscast marge sherwood look disintereste good johnny flynn give we good interpretation spoil dickie greenleaf little screen chemistry dakota main issue cast eliot sumner freddie mile totally understand choose role personally think right decision apart questionable act ability seem portray arrogant privilege snobbiness freddie definitely watch well worth time give
1	Eiza Gonzalez character Dr. Salazar almost ruin this show for me. Her character didn't fit well with the rest of the group. I mean this show is a solid 9 but her character made it an high seven for me because of how annoying her character was. Also, I have a question, why didn't Wade infiltrate the boat Mike Evans was on with a mold? Rather use the nano fiber to kill all them innocent people? I understand time was a factor and perhaps the San-Ti would have known there was a mold inside the ship but Wade actions were genocide like. These folks were part of a cult and perhaps brainwashed, to kill all them kids was so wrong.	eiza gonzalez character dr salazar almost ruin show character fit well rest group mean show solid character make high seven annoy character also question wade infiltrate boat mike evans mold rather use nano fiber kill innocent people understand time factor perhaps san ti would know mold inside ship wade action genocide like folk part cult perhaps brainwash kill kid wrong
1	"I'm not a die-hard Fallout fan (played only New Vegas) so not gonna clutch the pearls over the show deviating from the lore/source material. In fact from what I heard, in some cases that might even be a good thing, when it comes to Bethesda's takes on the franchise.What I do care about is a solid story that has a fair amount of logic behind it and believable and sensible characters. And in that regard, the show is just a mess.The plot is unnecessarily convoluted, with past and present stumbling onto each other, and most of the key characters' motives remaining unclear pretty much up until the last episode of S1, which ends with a weak and ridiculous pop. And after that a lot of questions are still left to the viewer's best guesses and hopes that it will get resolved in the following episodes.Overall I don't understand the allure of these types of twisted narrations where the viewer is supposed to not understand a good half of what's going on on the screen. How is that satisfying to anybody? Why can't you just write some believable and relatable characters, surviving in the wasteland, making tough choices, and ""leveling up,"" just like the game?Or take ""The Boys"" - there is an element of mystery but most of it is pretty clear and fair to the spectator, and that doesn't hurt the show.7 for the acting, scenery, VFX, camera work and gore.

It used to be full of interesting and real diseases and finding the right diagnosis, therapy along with the struggle of residents which is just making it more personal. It also made many people want to be a doctor as far as I know, but know it's getting really downside.

1	"The first season was obviously the best season cause it was focused on the rookies, training and the plot was entertaining. A rookie cop dealing with everyday issues on the street.But the show has become less entertaining as they're just focusing on BLM nonsense. It's funny how almost all dangerous criminals are white and the the other ones play the victim card. They're either ""pushed"" in the wrong direction or wrongfully accused. The whole 4th season was just too political. The guy robs a liquor store and almost kills the owner, and they were like oh he didn't mean it. Another one steals a police helicopter and nothing happens.They just need to focus less on the political push and focus more on the entertaining sides."	first season obviously good season cause focus rookie train plot entertain rookie cop deal everyday issue street show become less entertain focus blm nonsense funny almost dangerous criminal white one play victim card either push wrong direction wrongfully accuse whole th season political guy rob liquor store almost kill owner like oh mean another one steal police helicopter nothing happen need focus less political push focus entertain side

The ending doesn't fit in with the show, they completely write the Anjin differently, right from the word go showing he gets back to England a grows old a feeble. Toronaga is revealed to be a power hungry warlord, which wasn't hinted at at all before this. It might have been a great twist if they had lent into it. Instead this amazing show ends with a whimper. The immense sacrifices that so many Honorable characters made turn out to be for nothing but one man's grab for power, a man who apparently has been secretly a sociopath the whole time who didn't care about the people who loved him and the dream of a free Japan. But if this was his character arc why when completely alone at his son's and best friend's funeral did he say to himself that their sacrifice would not be wasted. I'm so so sad and angry about this. The writing before this was truly incredible, it feels like the last episode was purposely tanked or written by a completely seperate group who hasn't seen the series up to that moment.This could have been a truly iconic series, a landmark in cinema and they spat on the ashes of what they had created.Definitely watch the show, just never watch the last episode.	near perfect episode one bad end time end fit show completely write anjin differently right word go show get back england grow old feeble toronaga reveal power hungry warlord hint might great twist lend instead amaze show end whimper immense sacrifice many honorable character make turn nothing one man grab power man apparently secretly sociopath whole time care people love dream free japan character arc completely alone son good friend funeral say sacrifice would waste sad angry write truly incredible feel like last episode purposely tank write completely seperate group see series moment could truly iconic series landmark cinema spat ash create definitely watch show never watch last episode
2	I would give this an easy 10/10.. if season 8 didn't exist. But it does, unfortunately.Season 1-6 10/10 Amazing, complex dialogue and intriguing logical story lines with strong character developments, shocking emotional moments and insane action scenes.Season 7- 8/10 - still really good but seemed rushed and had some illogical moments that made no sense like the Ayra/Sansa fall out and the time/teleporting issues beyond the wall which revealed some lazy writing. But all in all filled with great moments and good set up for the final season.Season 8- 2/10. I actually don't know where or start. Season 8 is a joke. Terrible writing. Nothing makes sense. The writers have butchered most character developments and given hardly any satisfying conclusions to their story arcs.Brans story had no pay off at all and his whole role as the 3 eyed raven proved pointless against the Night King.Jaime's redemption arc was cut off instantly with real no reason.The Night Kings death was underwhelming. Infact all of episode 3 was poor, with no real structure and poorly written end to the main story line of the show. The battle was shockingly illogical and horrendous tactics. Zero white walker fights, limited deaths and ridiculous plot armour. Also editing was poor- some moments characters would be surrounded by hundreds of wights but then the next shot they were all gone. The plot armour ruined the battle of Winterfell. 'All' the Dothraki wiped out in seconds yet Samwell Tarly can fend them off. Laughable.No Sansa and Cersei interaction of any sort which I would have liked to have seen. Although I appreciate this is just my personal disappointment rather than poor writing.-Rhaegal taken down by first 3 shots, yet Drogon dodges an Iron fleets worth of Scorpions at Kings Landing, just to serve the plot. I guess Euron forgot about Dany's dragon and her forces.-Jon does nothing all season (why was he resurrected if he didn't end the long night or atleast become King? The whole point of his resurrection is because the lord of light claimed he was needed alive). Speaking of Jon, what was the point of his lineage? It didn't change anything apart from give us unconvincing tension between him and Danaerys. I kind of like Danaerys going mad but it needed a lot more time and thought put into it - It went too far too fast with no substantial development to justify her killing thousands of innocent people. Again, Laughable. It needed seasons of planning and transitioning her character. After Dany's death it just skipped to Tyrion's trial and no one seemed phased over her death.Anything that required any thought from the Writers was done off screen, like Arya and Sansa finding out about Jon's lineage.Cersei, the clever mastermind who always has a deceitful plan up her sleeve does nothing but stand looking out of a window all season. What a waste of a character.Ayra does not use her faceless abilities. How cool would it have been for something like Ayra shockingly kills Jaime in order to get his face and uses it to get close to cersei, she thinks she is safe then is stabbed whilst in the arms of her 'brother' who reveals to be Ayra. Atleast something like that may have been more satisfying a few bricks falling onto her.Bran becomes king. Urghhh. He literally said countless times he could not be lord of winterfell or rule anymore. Why the sudden change of heart? No explanation? Oh typical.Prince that was promised? Oh yeh let's forget about that too. Haha we fooled you audience.However, my main issue was not with what happened but with how it all happened. Rushed and made no sense.Major let downs and bad dialogue throughout. There are some good moments like Brienne being Knighted, but even that becomes ruined when she sleeps with Jaime- their relationship was so much nicer just being about honour and respect for one another. Have to appreciate effort by cast, visual and music crew and the few decent scenes as a whole.Overall- 9/10 purely on S1-7.	would give easy season exist unfortunately season amaze complex dialogue intrigue logical story line strong character development shock emotional moment insane action scene season still really good seem rush illogical moment make sense like ayra sansa fall time teleport issue beyond wall reveal lazy write fill great moment good set final season season actually know start season joke terrible write nothing make sense writer butcher character development give hardly satisfy conclusion story arc bran story pay whole role eye raven prove pointless night king jaime redemption arc cut instantly real reason night king death underwhelme infact episode poor real structure poorly write end main story line show battle shockingly illogical horrendous tactic zero white walker fight limit death ridiculous plot armour also edit poor moment character would surround hundred wight next shoot go plot armour ruin battle winterfell dothraki wipe second yet samwell tarly fend laughable sansa cersei interaction sort would like see although appreciate personal disappointment rather poor write rhaegal take first shot yet drogon dodge iron fleet worth scorpion king land serve plot guess euron forget dany dragon force jon nothing season resurrect end long night atleast become king whole point resurrection lord light claim need alive speak jon point lineage change anything apart give we unconvincing tension danaery kind like danaery go mad need lot time think put go far fast substantial development justify kill thousand innocent people laughable need season plan transition character dany death skip tyrion trial one seem phase death anything require think writer do screen like arya sansa find jon lineage cersei clever mastermind always deceitful plan sleeve nothing stand look window season waste character ayra use faceless ability cool would something like ayra shockingly kill jaime order get face use get close cersei think safe stab whilst arm brother reveal ayra atleast something like may satisfy brick fall onto bran become king urghhh literally say countless time could lord winterfell rule anymore sudden change heart explanation oh typical prince promise oh yeh let forget haha fool audience however main issue happen happen rush make sense major let down bad dialogue throughout good moment like brienne knight even become ruin sleep jaime relationship much nice honour respect one another appreciate effort cast visual music crew decent scene whole overall purely
0	Why can't anything be made without so much sex and nudity ?! This is a great show so far , but the women nudity is not necessary! I'm so tired of everything needing to have it . I don't mind if a show needs to show chemistry with characters but it's really not necessary here. Game of Thrones is disgusting as well . There is just no need for so much of it every single episode. Im disappointed. Was just wanting to watch this with my kid who loves this type of thing but with the nudity I hesitate. Yeah it can be skipped but I feel I'm so over needing to be careful. For once a decent show can be decent with NO NUDITY!! It's always women too .

1	There's no discussion about the suberb camera work and the clever use of black and white to capture the smaller and more claustrophobic world of the 1960es. The series has an authentic feel of European films of that time. Very well done. That said, why? Highsmith did not write Ripley in black and white, nor did Caravaggio paint in black and white. An alternative artistic rendering of these works over the course of 8 hour-long episodes? That said, my biggest problem is that Andrew Scott, as brilliant an actor as he is, A. Is way too old to credibly play a fellow student of Dickey, which makes everybody look like fools, and B. He plays Tom without the empathy that you need in order to cheer for a charmless murderer over the span of 8 hour-long episodes. If noir was intended, it does not work for me, I simply do not care for the Tom Ripley he portrays, and keep thinking why he wasn't left in the gutters of New York, contrary to the Tom Ripley that Patricia Highsmith wrote about.	discussion suberb camera work clever use black white capture small claustrophobic world es series authentic feel european film time well do say highsmith write ripley black white caravaggio paint black white alternative artistic render work course hour long episode say big problem andrew scott brilliant actor way old credibly play fellow student dickey make everybody look like fool b play tom without empathy need order cheer charmless murderer span hour long episode noir intend work simply care tom ripley portray keep think leave gutter new york contrary tom ripley patricia highsmith write
2	"Ripley is a captivating and thrilling series that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The complex and enigmatic character of Tom Ripley is truly brought to life with incredible depth and charisma, making it impossible to look away. The multiple plot twists and turns are executed masterfully, keeping the audience guessing and engaged throughout the series. The acting is superb, the stunning cinematography makes every scene incredible, and a top-notch storytelling makes this binge-worthy. Without a doubt, ""Ripley"" deserves a clear 9- star rating for its exceptional quality and compelling narrative. Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys a gripping and sophisticated drama.The one reason this does not meet its otherwise clear ten star: The pacing was a tad drawn out. I would argue 6 episodes may have been a batter timeline, though it is a challenging line to walk between pacing and fleshing out the series."	ripley captivate thrill series keep edge seat start finish complex enigmatic character tom ripley truly bring life incredible depth charisma make impossible look away multiple plot twist turn execute masterfully keep audience guess engage throughout series act superb stun cinematography make every scene incredible top notch storytelling make binge worthy without doubt ripley deserve clear star rat exceptional quality compel narrative highly recommend anyone enjoy grip sophisticate drama one reason meet otherwise clear ten star pace tad draw would argue episode may batter timeline though challenge line walk pace flesh series
1	I would watch anything featuring Nathan Fillion in even a minor role so, naturally, I gave this show a chance. And was more than a little disappointed. It has most of the necessary elements including a strong supporting cast. It's filmed in LA which I love. But it just misses out. The writing isn't strong but that could be partly because you're taken in too many directions during an episode. By trying to follow all of the partners in different situations it doesn't allow you to get invested in any of them. There seems to be little in the way of music, whether it be scoring or simply songs to underscore the drama and I find this to be a huge deficit. The right music in the right moment really cements the scene in your mind. The cast is strong but does Richard T have another expression? I'd love to see it sometime. Ultimately The Rookie is entertaining enough, but a bit of a letdown.	would watch anything feature nathan fillion even minor role naturally give show chance little disappoint necessary element include strong support cast film la love miss write strong could partly take many direction episode try follow partner different situation allow get invest seem little way music whether score simply song underscore drama find huge deficit right music right moment really cement scene mind cast strong richard another expression love see sometime ultimately rookie entertain enough bite letdown
2	So far, this series is shaping up to be the next great, I really hope it continues down this path as it has a very strong start with the first two opening episodes. Shogun offers a brutally real look at feudal life without the romanticisation often seen in media set in this period of Japan.I am watching this without watching the older show or reading the novel so am going in blind, so far everything from the sets, the outfits and weaponry are all impressive.As someone who missed out on the hype of some of the big culture hitting shows such as GoT. I intend to stay on the ride for this one!

0	Being totally unaware that the story comes from a trilogy of books, I liked the IMDb synopsis and went for it. First episode I accepted would be more of an introduction to get to know the players, which it was. But the second episode was just as slow and one didn't know what the story was really going to be about. As I like a good sci fi show, the bits that were uncovered were real quantum stuff and not a lot of nonsense. Alas the show was spoiled by too much talking and too much irrelevant other happenings to fill an episode. I started losing interest by episode five but continued binge watching. Eventually we learnt of the true nature of this story and I was keen to see what the threat looked like, but for that we have to wait for season 2. Pity, season 1 could have earned a higher star rating from me if it was faster paced and not full of conversation, which was often boring to watch. Never the less, I eagerly await season two, which can only be a vast improvement of this introductory season, being drawn-out disappointing.	totally unaware story come trilogy book like imdb synopsis go first episode accept would introduction get know player second episode slow one know story really go like good sci fi show bit uncover real quantum stuff lot nonsense alas show spoil much talk much irrelevant happen fill episode start lose interest episode five continue binge watch eventually learn true nature story keen see threat look like wait season pity season could earn high star rat fast pace full conversation often bear watch never less eagerly await season two vast improvement introductory season draw disappoint
2	"Grey's Anatomy is sometimes considered a ""chick flick"" or a ""girly"" show. That is the furthest thing from the truth. The surgical cases are all very interesting, even though it can be far fetched at times. The romantic-drama is obviously a big part if what makes the show interesting, especially for female audiences, but it makes for great suspense on what will happen next. It sucks that George died early as he was one of the main characters that seemed like he'd last in the show forever - same goes for Izzy and Christina. I personally really liked Dr. Burke as I thought he played a great role in the show. The good thing is, characters come and go so with how the story has gone it isn't impossible for some of the former main characters to come back. The only stale season in the show in my opinion was when Derek died. After that and onward into the next season it didn't feel the same. It definitely made for an adjustment when watching the show but it eventually blew over. Season 16 was one of the best seasons yet with all of the relationship drama with Owen and Teddy, and with Teddy being pregnant and falling for both Owen and Tom Koracick. The cliffhanger at the end of Season 16 with Owen canceling the wedding was quite interesting. I don't want to mention the situation with Richard as someone reading this review may not be that far yet (no, he doesn't die). I'm really looking forward to the next season in this series."	grey anatomy sometimes consider chick flick girly show furthest thing truth surgical case interest even though far fetch time romantic drama obviously big part make show interest especially female audience make great suspense happen next suck george die early one main character seem like last show forever go izzy christina personally really like dr burke think play great role show good thing character come go story go impossible former main character come back stale season show opinion derek die onward next season feel definitely make adjustment watch show eventually blow season one good season yet relationship drama owen teddy teddy pregnant fall owen tom koracick cliffhanger end season owen cancel we d quite interest want mention situation richard someone read review may far yet die really look forward next season series

I must confess that I only managed to put myself through three episodes of this atrocity before I could endure no more and gave up. It has been a while since I have seen anything this bafflingly bad, a big mess, a disjointed cacophony passing as content. Imbued and drenched with all the modern day ideological tropes and virtue signaling, bereft of anything resembling creativity or originality... and more importantly quality.I honestly don't care about the video games. I have no personal attachment to this IP, was only marginally familiar with the lore, so I approached this show as a newbie with no prior expectations. Therefore, I am only looking at this as a series, which I had hoped would be at least entertaining, containing a good story and interesting characters. None of that available here. Quite the opposite.A waste of time and brain cells.

2	It seems like some people here should expose themselves to classic noir films and books this series finds its inspiration in. Folks criticizing the internal dialogue, that's a time-honored device of the genre as is, a slow burn pace and flashbacks. Maybe people these days are too accustomed to explosions and car chases to appreciate a little mystery. Read some Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett or watch a Robert Mitchum or Humphrey Bogart movie in the genre. Farrell is definitely well cast and the cinematography is sumptuous. I'm excited to see where this series takes us. We were glued to the screen and can't wait for me.	seem like people expose classic noir film book series find inspiration folk criticize internal dialogue time honor device genre slow burn pace flashback maybe people day accustom explosion car chase appreciate little mystery read raymond chandler dashiell hammett watch robert mitchum humphrey bogart movie genre farrell definitely well cast cinematography sumptuous excite see series take we glue screen wait

1	First thing first, if you never read the book, it's not a bad show, some Chinese actors really shine in it but the rest are not much to write home about. The children were pretencious and the writing was a bit lazy. But all in all it's an enjoyable show.If you read the book like I did, you might be put off a little cos it's not exactly how it was in the book, it's way faster paced and of course will skip a few things here and there, the biggest issue is introducing so many new characters NOT from the book, however I understand where the director(s) were coming from - to tell the story in such a pace you need a few different aspects, I also understand the reason why it's fast-paced, as 1, audience nowadays have a short attention span (thanks to all the short vids apps), 2. It costs a lot of money to produce shows like this, and having too many episodes is not economically feasible.2 episodes in and I am actually liking it, so here's a 6.5, hopefully the rest will be better.	first thing first never read book bad show chinese actor really shine rest much write home child pretencious write bite lazy enjoyable show read book like might put little cos exactly book way fast pace course skip thing big issue introduce many new character book however understand director come tell story pace need different aspect also understand reason fast pace audience nowadays short attention span thank short vid app cost lot money produce show like many episode economically feasible episode actually like hopefully rest well
1	"This is a ""hard-to-review"" TV show in my opinion. My father was a police officer for almost 20 years, had some extreme case, like a serial killer that he found, or a car chase, which went for almost 50km. He had a gunfight, which is really rare in my country. But most of the time it wasn't this action packed. And here comes my issues with almost any cop/investigation series. Reality.And that is something which got me into this show. Reality. The episode, where *Spoiler* Nolan kills someone really something, that my father experienced. That episode really got me. Also, the psychological side of the show is amazing, I really enjoy the dynamic between characters, especially the TOs.But my problem with the show is... Well the lack of reality. After season 2 it feels like it fell apart. Season 3 was okay, but after that, it has no logic and sometimes the timeskips aren't really obvious. Also, my biggest logical issue is *Spoiler* Chen wants to become an undercover agent, after she was on 2 documentaries and a nationwide hostage drama. Basically everyone saw her on TV. Also, there are way to much action going on for my liking. When watching it, I was afraid, that it will become just another Crime/Action show, which it kind of did. But the last episode of season 5 is the best episode of the show, for me at least.And let's talk about the chemistry. Chenford is something I really enjoy, that's the best chemistry in the show by far. And yet again, in the first 2 seasons, the chemistry is great. Every couple on screen is fine. But after that, something is wrong. Only Chen and Bradford works as a couple for me. Also the dynamic between the officers are basically non existent at this point.If I would have to review the series, I would give it a 9 to S1 & S2, 7 for S3, and 5 for S4 and S5."	hard review tv show opinion father police officer almost year extreme case like serial killer find car chase go almost km gunfight really rare country time action pack come issue almost cop investigation series reality something get show reality episode spoiler nolan kill someone really something father experience episode really get also psychological side show amaze really enjoy dynamic character especially tos problem show well lack reality season feel like fall apart season okay logic sometimes timeskip really obvious also big logical issue spoiler chen want become undercover agent documentary nationwide hostage drama basically everyone see tv also way much action go like watch afraid become another crime action show kind last episode season good episode show least let talk chemistry chenford something really enjoy good chemistry show far yet first season chemistry great every couple screen fine something wrong chen bradford work couple also dynamic officer basically non existent point would review series would give

In the earlier seasons you can spend 40 minutes watching the characters just engage in conversation, it was that clever, but then the writers run out of books and they try to be what they were hired to be. A writers.But unfortunately the writers were too dumb and have no imagination to keep the standards that the books set previously, so you get the characters completely devoted of their true personality, and all the character development just gets thrown out of the window.Plot holes, the power of teleportation, forgetting about storylines, just terribly bad.It is unbelievablly sad to watch this TV phenomenon fall apart in front of your very own eyes.Shame.Unfortunately, I don't think GRRM will ever finish the books, with him being old and fat, he will probably die before that, and we will never get the closure we deserve.	forget bad downfall much easy notice decline quality binge watch spot show slowly start go sewer even season confirm season come oh oh bad dialog hurt early season spend minute watch character engage conversation clever writer run book try hire writer unfortunately writer dumb imagination keep standard book set previously get character completely devote true personality character development get throw window plot hole power teleportation forget storyline terribly bad unbelievablly sad watch tv phenomenon fall apart front eye shame unfortunately think grrm ever finish book old fat probably die never get closure deserve

I'm a MD myself and the content is straight for Hollywood, everybody makes love to everybody, the ones we love are dying away, well could watch The Hollywood Reporter instead! We just finished the second season, I must admit that I keep on watching, hoping that at least something goes better, but...it's getting worse & worse. Maybe we should lower the therapeutic costs for the writer, then we could have the chance to get a little more hope that it is worth to live ans work as a doctor. Why must everything concerning medicine be cynical & stupid(like Scrubs) or chaotic negative (like ER). Is this what you want to see as a revenge for the US-medical insurance system? Give you a completely wrong view of the hospital system, plenty of brainless prejudices. The first episode was hard and out of reality, after some smalltalk and love matters the depression goes on. If you ever failed getting on a medical university, you will like it, as it shows you a wrong life nobody would choose, if not completely insane. The best answer to the jealousy towards MDs. The best serial if you like getting depressed...	sick sick accord tv drama life suck md content straight hollywood everybody make love everybody one love die away well could watch hollywood reporter instead finish second season must admit keep watch hop least something go well get worse bad maybe low therapeutic cost writer could chance get little hope worth live ans work doctor must everything concern medicine cynical stupid like scrub chaotic negative like er want see revenge us medical insurance system give completely wrong view hospital system plenty brainless prejudice first episode hard reality smalltalk love matter depression go ever fail get medical university like show wrong life nobody would choose completely insane good answer jealousy towards mds good serial like get depress
2	My rating for this series was a 10/10 until the final season. I avoid thinking about the show after I turned off the TV, put down the remote, left the room, and shut the door behind me. I don't even want to touch the DVD which is why they're still even on the shelf.Watching the final season was like watching a train speeding towards a broken bridge, and realizing too late that you are on the train.The plot is forced (to end the show), the acting is forced (to follow the plot), and the characters are forced (to die). I haven't read the books, was planning to, but now can't bear to be reminded of the bad taste that's still in my mouth. I hope the books have a better ending, they really deserve a better ending, we all do.	rat series final season avoid think show turn tv put remote leave room shut door behind even want touch dvd still even shelf watch final season like watch train speed towards break bridge realize late train plot force end show act force follow plot character force die read book plan bear remind bad taste still mouth hope book well end really deserve well end
1	I've read the book several times and have the original miniseries on dvd. On the whole, I'm glad I've watched this new version. The modern production techniques make the original series look somewhat dated; however, I think that already being a fan may have detracted from the experience. The book is fantastic and the original miniseries is much closer to the book. In this new version I was regularly filling in gaps and there were a few changes to the the storyline that I found jarring.If you've never read the book or seen the original miniseries you'll likely find this new adaptation enjoyable, otherwise you may, like me, find it a little disappointing and already planning to re-read the book and watch the original.	read book several time original miniserie dvd whole glad watch new version modern production technique make original series look somewhat date however think already fan may detract experience book fantastic original miniserie much close book new version regularly fill gap change storyline find jar never read book see original miniserie likely find new adaptation enjoyable otherwise may like find little disappoint already plan read book watch original
0	"I guess reviews for the show are written by die-hard fans. Or maybe people now ready to eat-up whatever content, they can get, that looks good. I mean it, the show does look great. It gets post-apocalyptic aesthetics to the T, and is filled with little details that are capable to tell a story of their own. In a game this would be a real achievement, and it was: even though I never got into Fallout series, I can admit, that it had high detalization of the world through-out. At least in the main series games, that I did try.But even for a game it's not enough: you need a good story, and good gameplay there, too. I never liked the gameplay part of the series, it just did not click with me unlike The Elder Scrolls, but TV shows don't need to bother with that. TV show creators' job is much easier then, right?In my opinion, these TV show creators fail at their job. I often complain about series, that have too much talking without using visual to tell the story. This one is the reverse: there is too little of talking, or at least of talking that would develop character, world of move plot along. Some reviewers did notice this as well, pointing out, that it feels like screenwriters were writing for a game, and for TV.If this was a short movie, this might have been fine, but for TV show - not so much. For me it was boring. Only the first part of the 1st episode was somewhat interesting to me. It was a cliche, but still a good starting point for a story: a sheltered society gets raided, and that forces a character (or characters) to go outside of that society and learn about the world. But then we switch to part of that outside world, and it's not as interesting.It's not just Brotherhood of Steel, but the outside world in general. The creators are trying too hard to make it look ""uncivilized"" or ""militaristic"" or ""sterile"" or just ""weird"", and as result it all feels forced. As if they had a list of things to show, and they progressed through the story by checking items off that list.At the least, I think they should have used just 1 main plotline with the girl leaving shelter. It could have become a travel-show with fish-out-of-the-water theme, and each episode could have explored all the weirdness of this strange world, while the girl was moving forward. You know, a bit like The 10th Kingdom back from 2000, but post-nuclear. Alas, we have what we have. As is, I would rather rewatch Silo.

I wish for a destruction of bethesda offices and for the director to publicly apologise for the mutulation of this series. The characters are bland and stale and the plot feels lazy and stretched out. This show has no innovation and will not be remembered within next 2 months. This is a massive letdown and has not reached any expectations, it has went below them. I wish in the future shows such as this are not allowed by law and their creators publicly shamed and inprisoned.	show predictable low tier write completly retcon story arguably bad version fit new vision series wish destruction bethesda office director publicly apologise mutulation series character bland stale plot feel lazy stretch show innovation remember within next month massive letdown reach expectation go wish future show allow law creator publicly sham inprisone

1	"Having played most of the games, I went in expecting more ""halo""esque content, virtue signalling to the usual people who won't be watching because too many white people or whatever bonkers things goes through their minds, but slipping easter eggs from the actual game as breadcrumbs so we can all ignore our own amazon vault-tec feeding us our programming.And it does indeed deliver all of that.Whether it's the brotherhood cadet with pronouns everyone seems to respect because tolerance is really one of the building blocks of steel.. :P Whether it's the shrewd business woman and her lesbian partner in filly who's basically the railroad for wayward enclave scientists.Whether it's the rebranding of communism..It's all there in it's self righteous glory.That said though, the story is about Lucy, who was raised in a vault, with an apparent significant amount of inbreeding that doesn't seem to be touched upon too much, beyond ""messing around with your cousins"". Though it might explain her freakishly large eyes?She has all the subtle hints at S. P. E. C. I. A. L, which suggests she's low S, mid P, lowish E, high C, low I, low A and maxed L. If you know, you know.Her vault 33 is, allegedly, linked to two other vaults 31 and 32, and to combat inbreeding they import breeders from other vaults to carry on the american gene, so one day they can come out of the vaults and reclaim the surface.But alas, this is a ploy of the villain/hero/visionary. Lee Moldaver, played by mediocre actress somethingsomething who cares, she's barely on camera. But she's super scary, everyone says so.. like the 3 times someone talk about her through the entire season.. What we do learn is that Lucy's dad, the overseer of vault 33, KNOWS HER, intimately.. so.. naturally he warns everyone.. oh no wait.. I guess the writers forgot, so he just neglected to tell anyone.. and gets a load of his dwellers killed and himself kidnapped so the plot can happen.Naturally Lucy but also the most useless members of vault 33 survive.. somehow.. and suddenly has an effective security force.. somehow, and doesn't want to rescue her father, so with the help of her kissing cousin and confused looking brother she escapes the vault to go looking for him.From then on it is.. somewhat chaotic where the show goes.Maximus the storm trooper.. sorry brotherhood of steel cadet selling out his comrades the second he is free to, instantly falling for Lucy was uh... necessary for the cringy power armor scenes and needed to be tied together somehow. Also some gratuitous male nudity scenes inbetween. Gotta have those.Cooper Howard AKA The Ghoul, hunting for the mcguffin because he has backstory reasons, really. His story isn't great to be honest, though the actor did what he could with the material. Easily the best character of the show.It scrambles the lore from the games into whatever amazon wants, changing the entire canon from China dropping the bombs because the US was developing supersoldiers, to eeeeevil corporations dropping the bombs to kill the competition.. except it turns out all the vaults are factions competing... so .. uh... factions bad except when good, because that's... that's what the writers wrote.Pitch meeting will have a field day with this.."	play game go expect halo esque content virtue signal usual people watch many white people whatever bonker thing go mind slip easter egg actual game breadcrumb ignore amazon vault tec feed we program indeed deliver whether brotherhood cadet pronoun everyone seem respect tolerance really one build block steel p whether shrewd business woman lesbian partner filly basically railroad wayward enclave scientist whether rebrande communism self righteous glory say though story lucy raise vault apparent significant amount inbreede seem touch upon much beyond mess around cousin though might explain freakishly large eye subtle hint p e c l suggest low mid p lowish e high c low low maxe l know know vault allegedly link two vault combat inbreede import breeder vault carry american gene one day come vault reclaim surface alas ploy villain hero visionary lee moldaver play mediocre actress somethingsomethe care barely camera super scary everyone say like time someone talk entire season learn lucy dad overseer vault know intimately naturally warn everyone oh wait guess writer forget neglect tell anyone get load dweller kill kidnap plot happen naturally lucy also useless member vault survive somehow suddenly effective security force somehow want rescue father help kiss cousin confuse look brother escape vault go look somewhat chaotic show go maximus storm trooper sorry brotherhood steel cadet sell comrade second free instantly fall lucy uh necessary cringy power armor scene need tie together somehow also gratuitous male nudity scene inbetween get ta cooper howard aka ghoul hunt mcguffin backstory reason really story great honest though actor could material easily good character show scramble lore game whatever amazon want change entire canon china drop bomb we develop supersoldier eeeeevil corporation drop bomb kill competition except turn vault faction compete uh faction bad except good writer write pitch meet field day
1	Visual translations of a work of fiction always problematic. But this version of Shogun alters too much of the original.Kudos for trying to depict the intrigues and manipulations of the Japanese nobility during this critical period in their history. The expansion of that material may help contemporary audiences.Blackthorne more of an enigma than in the novel. Yes, he finds himself in a totally alien culture. How he comes to understand it is a huge part of the story. But inventing certain characters' traits to shortcut that realization lessens his importance in the story.No need to invent material in a book that showed all the forces at work so compellingly.	visual translation work fiction always problematic version shogun alter much original kudo try depict intrigue manipulation japanese nobility critical period history expansion material may help contemporary audience blackthorne enigma novel yes find totally alien culture come understand huge part story invent certain character trait shortcut realization lessen importance story need invent material book show force work compellingly
1	"Science facts: alfa centaury is a two sun system with an attached red dwarf sun (Proxima centaury). And no: not all three body systems are chaotic (see Sun-Earth-Moon). Three or multi body systems used to be a scientific challenge back in the day (10th century) without computers. Some claimed it is an proof that science is not capable of being a replacement for religion. Today multi body systems can be simulated with tremendous precision for very long periods of time. Most of them are very stable. It depends on the distribution of masses. In the solar system the sun has > 99% of the overall mass which makes it stable. For Alfa Centaury this is not the case. The two suns orbit each other in a stable way. But for smaller planets there is a good chance to not have a stable orbit and sooner or later they get kicked out. Unlikely that any inhabitable planet exists there - but we don't know. The story as such has some good ideas. But as it is supposed to be close to reality (not like Star Wars or Star Trek) other stuff just doesn't fit (invisible characters etc). The acting is a little of. And there are some characters that simply slow down things without adding much for the story telling. Like with any series: every time momentum builds - it shortly after breaks down and we go back to slow story telling to get enough material for 8 episodes and potential sequels. IMHO this KILLS any good entertainment. After a while, no matter how good the ideas are, it simply get boring and one looses focus. Again: some really good story ideas but stretched out so much - all ""fire"" fades to gray."	science fact alfa centaury two sun system attach red dwarf sun proxima centaury three body system chaotic see sun earth moon three multi body system use scientific challenge back day th century without computer claim proof science capable replacement religion today multi body system simulate tremendous precision long period time stable depend distribution mass solar system sun overall mass make stable alfa centaury case two sun orbit stable way small planet good chance stable orbit soon later get kick unlikely inhabitable planet exist know story good idea suppose close reality like star war star trek stuff fit invisible character etc act little character simply slow thing without add much story tell like series every time momentum build shortly break go back slow story tell get enough material episode potential sequel imho kill good entertainment matter good idea simply get bore one loose focus really good story idea stretch much fire fade gray
2	"It is pretty incredible. I think this has the power to be the next Game of Thrones. Will the subtitles put people off? I hope not, but it's always a factor.I'm sure some more articulate will set up this story on here, but here's a quick paragraph:These first two episodes follow the first Englishman to cross the Japanese borders and what this means for the country. The country is in a matter of states with no appointed Shogun. After being captured by multiple parties, the Englishman brings information that the Portuguese and Spanish have ""claimed"" this part of the world saying; The kings right to claim any non-Catholic land discovered by their subjects. This infuriated the leader. Letting the Englishman ""John Blackthorne"" live, assuming to be their source of information- let's him stay on his quarters for the night. The rest I'll leave it to you to watch or find out yourself.This is epic in every sense. Perfectly balanced pacing in terms of story telling and gruesome action.All actors play their roles very convincingly, Cosmo Jarvis is channelling something between a Tom Hardy character but with a Daniel Plainview cadence of speaking. Bring on the conspiracies, politics and play for who to be Shogun.Bottom line is I love this already after 2 episodes."	pretty incredible think power next game throne subtitle put people hope always factor sure articulate set story quick paragraph first two episode follow first englishman cross japanese border mean country country matter state appoint shogun capture multiple party englishman bring information portuguese spanish claim part world say king right claim non catholic land discover subject infuriate leader let englishman john blackthorne live assume source information let stay quarter night rest leave watch find epic every sense perfectly balance pace term story tell gruesome action actor play role convincingly cosmo jarvis channel something tom hardy character daniel plainview cadence speak bring conspiracy politic play shogun bottom line love already episode
1	I love crime shows, movies, and books. I like Farrell and plenty of the other actors. This show is 100% in my wheelhouse.However, after 4 episodes, I'm giving up for one simple reason: why are the episodes 30 minutes?! It's unorthodox and unnecessary. Since the renewal period of my Apple subscription was two days away, I decided to cancel rather than keep it for weeks and weeks to finish this one show. If they were proper hour long episodes I could see it being more worth my money. However, since this is literally the only good show after they cancelled Shantaram, I'd rather put my money into a more consistent service. If Shantaram had been renewed, I would not have cancelled and would have continued watching Sugar week to week.Now, I'll just log in when it's donee, watch, and cancel. In short: Apple makes some decent shows, but not enough to justify year-round no-discount subscriptions. You can literally log in for one or two months twice a year and not miss anything, especially when episodes are a half hour.	love crime show movie book like farrell plenty actor show wheelhouse however episode give one simple reason episode minute unorthodox unnecessary since renewal period apple subscription two day away decide cancel rather keep week week finish one show proper hour long episode could see worth money however since literally good show cancel shantaram rather put money consistent service shantaram renew would cancel would continue watch sugar week week log donee watch cancel short apple make decent show enough justify year round discount subscription literally log one two month twice year miss anything especially episode half hour
2	I must say, this show was quite challenging to watch, as I could imagine it would be for most. And yet, I was completely pulled into the story, compelled and disturbed by its characters, themes, and how brutally honest all of it was portrayed. For me, it's really a deep character study around human behaviour, the complexities and often confusing nature of the relationships we can share with other people, people we care about and love, and even people that know how to take advantage of and have power over us; for those who have watched the show, you will know which relationship in particular I am referring to.Something I just deeply loved and respected about this show was how imperfect the main character, Donnie, was portrayed as being. He was clearly a victim, but Richard Gadd didn't shy away from the wrongdoings and omissions Donnie himself engaged in throughout the show, which were clearly a response to his internal damage and trauma, but which tragically ended up damaging many of his important relationships. Additionally, the way in which Donnie could behave in his private time I thought was another disturbing, and yet refreshingly, honest portrayal of the ugly ways in which human beings can respond to trauma. The places they went in this show were just truly incredible.There are various points in the show where Donnie almost seems to overcome his damage, where he experiences a sense of release, brought about by his honesty towards himself and towards the people he cares about. But, in a beautiful subversion of the classical narrative structure or character arc which might end on the fulfilment a resolution, we find that Donnie tends to seep back into his obsessive thoughts and confused state of mind, leading back to patterns of behaviour that the audience hopes Donnie has overcome, but reality just isn't like that, humanity is much more complex, and it often takes a very long time to find true release, and Richard Gadd, in his wisdom and brutally honest self-reflection, seems to understand this, and leaves the story somewhat unresolved, but in another sense coming full circle.This is a truly, truly beautiful work. Challenging, disturbing, all the whilst being incredibly refreshing in its honesty, and also a masterclass in acting and storytelling by all involved, particularly by Richard Gadd and the marvellous Jessica Gunning. I would recommend this work to anyone who appreciates brutal honesty in art, and bravery in the creators to go where others might fear to go.	must say show quite challenge watch could imagine would yet completely pull story compel disturb character theme brutally honest portray really deep character study around human behaviour complexity often confuse nature relationship share people people care love even people know take advantage power we watch show know relationship particular refer something deeply love respect show imperfect main character donnie portray clearly victim richard gadd shy away wrongdoing omission donnie engage throughout show clearly response internal damage trauma tragically end damage many important relationship additionally way donnie could behave private time think another disturb yet refreshingly honest portrayal ugly way human be respond trauma place go show truly incredible various point show donnie almost seem overcome damage experience sense release bring honesty towards towards people care beautiful subversion classical narrative structure character arc might end fulfilment resolution find donnie tend seep back obsessive thought confuse state mind lead back pattern behaviour audience hop donnie overcome reality like humanity much complex often take long time find true release richard gadd wisdom brutally honest self reflection seem understand leave story somewhat unresolve another sense come full circle truly truly beautiful work challenge disturb whilst incredibly refresh honesty also masterclass act storytelling involve particularly richard gadd marvellous jessica gun would recommend work anyone appreciate brutal honesty art bravery creator go other might fear go
0	I confess, I've only watched one episode of this series. I cannot will myself to continue with it. The lack of chemistry from the cast is honestly jaw dropping. Ripley is far too old. His encounter with Greenleaf and Marge is weird to an extreme level. He might as well be wearing a baseball cap with the word creepy emblazoned on it. It's not believable that they'd have him for lunch, or anything else after that first encounter. The Greenleaf shipping tycoon storyline is badly led down by Ripley's initial visit to the dry dock when we see what appears to be a wooden hull fishing boat. Seriously? That's not a shipping magnate with vast wealth. The feature version got this a thousand times better on every level. It had glamour and beauty and charisma and charm and style. This has absolutely zero. B&W drains all the life out of it. Imagine going to the Italian Riviera and shooting black and white. It really symbolises the terrible missteps with this whole production. You feel no heat. No joy or beauty. Characters are pure cardboard with no soul. Just watch the original movie. Anthony Minghella (a genius) (RIP) really nailed it. Matt Damon, Jude Law and all the cast in that movie were terrific. Even Ripley's Game with John Malkovich is more deserving of your time than this. Sad.	confess watch one episode series continue lack chemistry cast honestly jaw drop ripley far old encounter greenleaf marge weird extreme level might well wear baseball cap word creepy emblazon believable lunch anything else first encounter greenleaf ship tycoon storyline badly lead ripley initial visit dry dock see appear wooden hull fish boat seriously ship magnate vast wealth feature version get thousand time well every level glamour beauty charisma charm style absolutely zero b w drain life imagine go italian riviera shoot black white really symbolise terrible misstep whole production feel heat joy beauty character pure cardboard soul watch original movie anthony minghella genius rip really nail matt damon jude law cast movie terrific even ripley game john malkovich deserve time sad

0	I am not a fan of this video game or any other. This is a dystopian fantasy series and I am a sci-fi consumer. To analyze it from the perspective of the minimum necessary to interest an adult audience is pointless. This is a product for uncritical spirits.There is a lot of blood but the action scenes are poorly choreographed, with no sense of pacing or continuity. It's all just a bunch of gags about exploding heads, shattered legs and explosive gunfire but lacking in narrative.The director (sorry, Jonathan) has no sense of story flow and splashes fades to black here and there because the script is full of holes and the stories don't string together.The plot wanders between supposed comedy and bloody space thriller without deciding on either option.The premise of the young girl leaving the shelter to find her father who has been kidnapped is as absurd as the very fact that head-busting Neanderthals have kidnapped her father.A disappointing failure for adults who love speculative fiction, science fiction and dystopias.	fan video game dystopian fantasy series sci fi consumer analyze perspective minimum necessary interest adult audience pointless product uncritical spirit lot blood action scene poorly choreograph sense pace continuity bunch gag explode head shatter leg explosive gunfire lack narrative director sorry jonathan sense story flow splash fade black script full hole story stre together plot wander suppose comedy bloody space thriller without decide either option premise young girl leave shelter find father kidnap absurd fact head bust neanderthals kidnap father disappoint failure adult love speculative fiction science fiction dystopia

It further presented in the so far published episodes a lot of flaws and illogical behavior of the characters. The story is simplified, rushed and takes stupid, unbelievable short cuts. Acting isn't that great and I cannot sense any chemistry, whether good or bad, amongst the characters, but that's probably due to the lazy script and directing. Cinematography is uninspiring and once more: who thought filming all in Canada would provide an ""authentic"" backdrop. Japan is beautiful and the film makers missed a great opportunity here. Because all of this, all portrayed feels unauthentic. Poor cast and characters. Most annoyingly Blackthorne, representing ""the English"", is just a Marty Stue, which is so utterly boring.These 10-point reviews seem fake in their vagueness and majority as there's no way that this cheap, lazy production is above a 7.

I don't know if it is the best idea to ""kill"" off one of the main characters this early in the game. Season 3 is still fairly early to start pondering with the idea of giving main people the axe. Aside from that, I am digging this story arc. It is so captivating! Qestion to the rest of you GA fans, do you think that Meredith is going to be out?

0	Lets be clear, i am not a hardcore fan i only watched several episodes and neither know the deep entanglement of the characters nor do i even know their names. But the things i watched left me kinda dumbstruck why this show has such a high popularity and is considered to show modern women in a modern society. The main critique doesn't even stem from the silly plots, but from the agenda and picture this series paints how modern life functions today. Especially from a womans view point. All the woman in this thing do is either argue, gossip or dish out snarky comments towards their co workers, patients or partners. I struggled to find a normal conversation that didn't evolve around those three. Sure this is meant to entertain but it would have done no harm injecting some realism into this stuff. Not every dialogue in real life is a back and forth with bitchy comments or some supposed sarcastic witty mic drops. All the woman are portrayed as this strong headed, going their own way, types who are in full control, men are only holding them back and are there for some fun between operations or to gossip about. Unless ofc fate strikes then these men are always there for a warm hug till it has blown over. The males in this series get pushed around and almost all the time mess up big time and just refuse to understand woman. The two Highlights for me in feminist propaganda and double standards were the one time that a dude almost died cause some woman beat him up (self defense my ass) and the patient got threatened that if he tried to bring her to court he will get beaten up worse by some male doctor in white knight armor. You cant be serious? Just imagine it the other way round oh boy. Second case when some red head Christian doctor lost her child and got divorced but still got pregnant from the same man. He wants to check if the baby has the same condition as the other child and thinks about aborting to spare them going through the grief again (sounds reasonable? WRONG) the female doctor proclaims with a death stare that its her body and her child so its her decission, he has no say at all. Weird I thought it takes two people to make a baby or have women suddenly developed a possibility to self fertilize? What is the message, men are mere seed donors and then they can gtfo? Also these woman superficial and hollow, no lovable bone in these hags. Cause looks in this world allow you to do anything.The characters are not likable at all the Asian doctor seems to get off on talking everybody down, the main characters acts like she has deep insight into the human mind when narrating all this BS but in the end she is just bi polar who goes from whiny wimp to arrogant hag in no time. the black plumb doctor is just obnoxious and the lesbians are just as bad as every other forced couple in this series. Which leads us to the next point the unrealistic and over the top plots. The weird thing is the patients get barely screen time and are mere vehicles for the doctors to have something to do while they talk about their love lives. What kind of hospital is this? First there are only surgeons present, no internist? No oncologists? Maybe this was explained somehow but seems just weird that every problem is solved by cutting the patient open. The patients barely get developed, they are just thrown into your face with their condition and you then watch the doctors gossip over something while they perform brain surgery. Very realistic. One episode was so ridiculous over the top, i nearly couldn't contain myself. During a big storm a whole bus of poor children crashes in front of the hospital, everybody is screaming, the main character also gets her baby and ofc the power goes out in the hospital, all at the same time. Ofc this bus is going to explode and some kids are trapped, but some hero doctor goes for saving while pulling off his shirt for the eye candy, this episode was such a big pile of garbage its borderline comedic. Other medical series at least manage to tell a more or less convincing story during the episode and give the short appearances some depth with simple measures. This show fails on all levels doing that, you don't care about the patient, you don't care about the doctors and just keep rolling your eyes in annoyance.If this is supposed to be a series from women for women i am kinda disappointed with their standards for entertainment and would advise to stick with Sex and the City, that at least had some humor in it. One star extra for the sometimes good choice of soundtrack.	let clear hardcore fan watch several episode neither know deep entanglement character even know name thing watch leave kinda dumbstruck show high popularity consider show modern woman modern society main critique even stem silly plot agenda picture series paint modern life function today especially womans view point woman thing either argue gossip dish snarky comment towards co worker patient partner struggle find normal conversation evolve around three sure mean entertain would do harm inject realism stuff every dialogue real life back forth bitchy comment suppose sarcastic witty mic drop woman portray strong head go way type full control man hold back fun operation gossip unless ofc fate strike man always warm hug till blow male series get push around almost time mess big time refuse understand woman two highlight feminist propaganda double standard one time dude almost die cause woman beat self defense ass patient get threaten try bring court get beat bad male doctor white knight armor can not serious imagine way round oh boy second case red head christian doctor lose child get divorce still get pregnant man want check baby condition child think abort spare go grief sound reasonable wrong female doctor proclaim death stare body child decission say weird think take two people make baby woman suddenly develop possibility self fertilize message man mere seed donor gtfo also woman superficial hollow lovable bone hag cause look world allow anything character likable asian doctor seem get talk everybody main character act like deep insight human mind narrate bs end bi polar go whiny wimp arrogant hag time black plumb doctor obnoxious lesbian bad every force couple series lead we next point unrealistic top plot weird thing patient get barely screen time mere vehicle doctor something talk love live kind hospital first surgeon present internist oncologist maybe explain somehow seem weird every problem solve cut patient open patient barely get develop throw face condition watch doctor gossip something perform brain surgery realistic one episode ridiculous top nearly contain big storm whole bus poor child crash front hospital everybody scream main character also get baby ofc power go hospital time ofc bus go explode kid trap hero doctor go save pull shirt eye candy episode big pile garbage borderline comedic medical series least manage tell less convince story episode give short appearance depth simple measure show fail level care patient care doctor keep roll eye annoyance suppose series woman woman kinda disappoint standard entertainment would advise stick sex city least humor one star extra sometimes good choice soundtrack

2	I have NOT played this video game, much to my partner's dismay and despite his obsession with it. Its concept intrigues me, but I'm just not much of a gamer. I knew my partner was awaiting the release of this series with keen interest, and judging by the trailers I'd seen, it looked like the kind of show I'd enjoy. My only concern was if I'd be unable to appreciate it since I haven't played the game. I'm writing this for any others out there who haven't played the game but are considering checking out the show.My husband did pause the first episode at least twice to brief me on the overall timeline concept (which I do have a slight issue with.... Hard to believe that clothing, furniture and home decor wouldn't have evolved. Not to mention other fields of science... but Okey Dokey) and later the ghouls/mutants. Had he not filled me in on those items, I'm sure I could've still watched the episode through to the end without feeling too bewildered. It's also easy enough to look up some basics on the game's universe if you feel like you need to prepare beforehand.What I loved: Quick paced, sleek look, well edited, solid cast and acting, lots of action, plenty of suspense and intrigue, and a sprinkle of wry humor. The first episode introduces us to the three major characters and three vastly different settings within the story's universe. Is compelling and very well done. As the season progresses, the show gets better every episode and leaves you wanting more! It's gripping, smart, fun, thrilling, and totally binge worthy. If you are a fan of shows in the genre of post-apocalyptic settings, alternate timelines, zombies, sci fi, action, you should definitely give it a try; it lives up to the hype.And for those who have played the game, my husband said loved the show, and that there were plenty of Easter Eggs in it to appease him as a Fallout gamer fanboy. 😊	play video game much partner dismay despite obsession concept intrigue much gamer know partner await release series keen interest judge trailer see look like kind show enjoy concern unable appreciate since play game write other play game consider check show husband pause first episode least twice brief overall timeline concept slight issue hard believe clothe furniture home decor evolve mention field science okey dokey later ghouls mutant fill item sure could still watch episode end without feel bewilder also easy enough look basic game universe feel like need prepare beforehand love quick pace sleek look well edit solid cast act lot action plenty suspense intrigue sprinkle wry humor first episode introduce we three major character three vastly different setting within story universe compel well do season progress show get well every episode leave want grip smart fun thrill totally binge worthy fan show genre post apocalyptic setting alternate timeline zombie sci fi action definitely give try live hype play game husband say love show plenty easter egg appease fallout gamer fanboy
2	5 episodes in, and this is one of the most immersive seasons I have seen in a long time. Not since early episodes of GoT have I been so truly and fully immersed in the story of a season due to exceptional world-building.The creative staff of this season has gone to great lengths to stay true to the Japanese culture of the time - be it customs, costumes, and even language. The majority of the dialogue of this show is in Japanese and it adds to the richness of the whole setting. Additionally, the Japanese cast bring in much needed native flair to the screen with powerful performances.Experiencing this season as a labor of love that stays true to the source material is a breath of fresh air in the banality that is current TV.	episode one immersive season see long time since early episode get truly fully immerse story season due exceptional world build creative staff season go great length stay true japanese culture time custom costume even language majority dialogue show japanese add richness whole set additionally japanese cast bring much need native flair screen powerful performance experience season labor love stay true source material breath fresh air banality current tv

Some characters' decisions were irrational and served only to move the plot forward.Also a bit of an issue with the world building.

2	The Rookie is one of the better cop shows on tv right now. Nathan Fillion leads a really good cast who all do a good job making this a show worth watching. Anyone who's seen Fillion in a show knows he never disappoints. This show does good job balancing drama, action, suspense and humor. It also shows how tough it is to be a police officer both at work and at home. Some of the negative reviews are from people that don't like that they take real world problems of today and apply them to the show. Everyone knows there are a thousand police shows to choose from but if you're looking for an exciting and original show then give The Rookie a try.	rookie one well cop show tv right nathan fillion lead really good cast good job make show worth watch anyone see fillion show know never disappoint show good job balance drama action suspense humor also show tough police officer work home negative review people like take real world problem today apply show everyone know thousand police show choose look excite original show give rookie try

1	I got hooked on the official Chinese program last year and after several episodes it stalled out and I started skipped ahead, which only made it worse. I think there was 4-5 episodes of the video game and I just couldn't be bothered. Then it got so out of hand I gave up and didn't finish.This American version looked promising from the previews, until I found out that the D&D guys that butchered the Game of Thrones series are behind this. The guys who just winged the last season of a great story, zero thinking and created the worst final season in the history of television. So yeah, there is going to be parts that absolutely make no sense so I'm prepared.I finished it and it's a decent watch. As other reviews have pointed out the casting is poor, female strong leads and bumbling men are standard as per 2020 Netflix. The dialogue is sub par with lots of buzz words. Lots of drama like a Friends episode. A few plot holes that just don't make sense which is expected with D&D running the show.It could have been really good, but these two guys just don't have the skills to make something anything better than average. I'm sure that they are wealthy enough from GoT, but they'll never get any awards.When you have an entire book series as a baseline, plus a popular Chinese television version of it for 30+ episodes it seems like you should be able to just pick out the good parts, summarize and edit. All of the heavy lifting, writing and creating is already done.I'm confident that D&D couldn't even remake Bambi to make it interesting and watchable. 5/10. Lots of chit chat and drama between the interesting scenes. Heck we even have time to chat about a goldfish.	get hook official chinese program last year several episode stall start skip ahead make bad think episode video game bother get hand give finish american version look promise preview find guy butcher game throne series behind guy wing last season great story zero think create bad final season history television yeah go part absolutely make sense prepare finish decent watch review point cast poor female strong lead bumble man standard per netflix dialogue sub par lot buzz word lot drama like friend episode plot hole make sense expect run show could really good two guy skill make something anything well average sure wealthy enough get never get award entire book series baseline plus popular chinese television version episode seem like able pick good part summarize edit heavy lift write create already do confident even remake bambi make interest watchable lot chit chat drama interest scene heck even time chat goldfish

And dont get me started on the legion, from what people were talking it sounds like legion never existed. I dont know if the creator played the dust mod or what but now it makes sens that he doesnt care about fans opinion. He knew what the reaction of fans would be. The only explanation would be that todd wanted the show to look like it so he could finally kick new vegas out of canon. The show also have bad color palet for the fallout universe. Its a good show if you ignore the fallout part of it.	destroy lore decanonise fallout new vegas good tv show forget fallout fallout make sesne could shady sand fall ncr fight legion right lose capital even never mention game do not get start legion people talk sound like legion never exist do not know creator play dust mod make sen do not care fan opinion know reaction fan would explanation would todd want show look like could finally kick new vegas canon show also bad color palet fallout universe good show ignore fallout part
1	The hardest thing is to assign a star rating to the whole program. It was at least a 9 the first year, dropping lower and lower as the second season progressed, until the maudlin, final episodes were aired. By the last episode of the 2nd season I was rating it a couple of stars. Why does something so fresh and interesting in the first season have to deteriorate into a daytime soap? Was there simply nothing more to say? The British have a solution to this problem. They don't try to stretch out their successes over multiple seasons. They move on to another new, interesting project, rather than trying to milk a dead horse forever. And now I read other reviewers saying the third season is even worse (even from commentators who, unlike me, liked the second season). Is anyone surprised? I've gone from being a major fan to being a major detractor in just two seasons.	hard thing assign star rat whole program least first year drop lower low second season progress maudlin final episode air last episode nd season rat couple star something fresh interest first season deteriorate daytime soap simply nothing say british solution problem try stretch success multiple season move another new interest project rather try milk dead horse forever read reviewer say third season even worse even commentator unlike like second season anyone surprise go major fan major detractor two season

0	Q: What is more boring, watching someone play a video game or watching a series based on a video game? A: Doesn't matter, either is boring whether you've played the game or not. Doubly so if you are an actual adult. In this case the game is Fallout 3.I've played the Fallout 3 video game and I thought it was one of the best single player video games I'd ever played. So, despite it being 16 years later, I was intrigued by the concept of a TV series based upon it. But the intrigue very quickly faded. Let's face it, the plot and writing of most games works because they are games and the interaction makes up for the weaknesses in story, plot, characters, etc. A video series doesn't have the interactivity to rely upon to liven up the show and make it interesting so its usually a failure. Such is the case with Fallout, the series.What you have here is a video game walkthrough of a 16 year old game. And just like the video game it is based upon it contains adult themes and graphic violence but is written for an audience who are actually too young to watch mature rated content.I'm envisioning a couple of guys from Bethesda kicking back with a stogie and a smile thinking about how they've cashed in on the same thing so many times now they've lost count of how many billions they've made off it. People sure do love copies of copies don't they? Yup, sure do.	q bore watch someone play video game watch series base video game matter either bore whether play game doubly actual adult case game fallout play fallout video game think one good single player video game ever play despite year later intrigue concept tv series base upon intrigue quickly fade let face plot write game work game interaction make weakness story plot character etc video series interactivity rely upon liven show make interest usually failure case fallout series video game walkthrough year old game like video game base upon contain adult theme graphic violence write audience actually young watch mature rat content envision couple guy bethesda kick back stogie smile think cash thing many time lose count many billion make people sure love copy copy yup sure
1	I watched 4 episodes of this series back to back after reading about the book (haven't read the book yet, no bias there). So, I am not judging it for accuracy but for whether it works or not.There are instances when it does and many more hours when it doesn't.The Chinese story is close to perfection. Acting and photography is mature and with depth. Older characters such as Cunningham, Chao, Wong and Pryce bring a lot to their roles, as well as our GoT hero John Bradley in possibly the most interesting and real character of the entire show. Alex Sharp in his melancholic role is pretty fantastic, as is the young Ye, Tseng. But it all ends there.Although the premise is quite fantastic and bold, the execution is simply very boring, unbelievable, uninteresting. The casting of Gonzales is very sad, Adepo is extremely out of place. What are they doing, how are they relevant? We will never know.I desperately wanted to see more science, but sadly, it is just the fiction we see, not the science in this sci-fi adventure.I leave 5 stars here for the amazing actors who will shine in whichever role they play.	watch episode series back back read book read book yet bias judge accuracy whether work instance many hour chinese story close perfection act photography mature depth old character cunningham chao wong pryce bring lot role well get hero john bradley possibly interest real character entire show alex sharp melancholic role pretty fantastic young ye tseng end although premise quite fantastic bold execution simply bear unbelievable uninteresting cast gonzale sad adepo extremely place relevant never know desperately want see science sadly fiction see science sci fi adventure leave star amaze actor shine whichever role play
0	Yes I endured most of this series, except the parts I slept through. I have not read the books and was initially intrigued but by about the fourth episode I was becoming annoyed with these supposedly brilliant young minds who were self absorbed and not particularly likeable. Getting high, getting drunk and smoking endless cigarettes was apparently their way of coping with anything that disrupted their lives. Oh, and by the way, aliens are on their way to destroy us. I won't be rushing to watch the second series. Possibly this is yet another case of stretching a story into multiple episodes when tight writing and less screen hours might have resulted in a superior and more enthralling series.	yes endure series except part sleep read book initially intrigue fourth episode become annoy supposedly brilliant young mind self absorb particularly likeable get high get drink smoke endless cigarette apparently way cop anything disrupt live oh way alien way destroy we rush watch second series possibly yet another case stretch story multiple episode tight write less screen hour might result superior enthral series

2	I often find it difficult to remain engaged in a TV series. Most I put down after watching either the first few episodes or sometimes even just the first episode.That wasn't the case here. I played the games, and decided to watch with family that hadn't. And it had a bit of everything. You were always wondering what was going to happen next. It was weird - in a good way. Even for someone like me in having played the games before, they throw in new storylines and ways of setting the scene that capture what makes Fallout Fallout in its own unique way.Highlight was the music - both the composed pieces and licenced songs. Seriously there is nothing quite like this series. Do give it a chance.	often find difficult remain engage tv series put watch either first episode sometimes even first episode case play game decide watch family bite everything always wonder go happen next weird good way even someone like play game throw new storyline way set scene capture make fallout fallout unique way highlight music compose piece licence song seriously nothing quite like series give chance
0	I feel like the show would've been 10x better if they'd removed the Lucy storyline and just followed the Ghoul. Her story added nothing and was just plain irritating. It was filled with plot holes, too.The show missed the entire vibe of Fallout and changed lore because they wanted to fit things neatly into their story. Everything felt forced, like they needed to cram as much in as possible.If you aren't a Fallout fan, maybe you'd like it? But if you are a fan, this just doesn't work. It felt like a really bad fan fic. I'm disappointed; I was really hoping that there would be a whole series we could enjoy in between games. I don't think I could make it through another episode.The show should've chosen a direction and a story and stuck with it instead of being all over the place. Just a mess.	feel like show would x well remove lucy storyline follow ghoul story add nothing plain irritate fill plot hole show miss entire vibe fallout change lore want fit thing neatly story everything feel force like need cram much possible fallout fan maybe like fan work feel like really bad fan fic disappoint really hop would whole series could enjoy game think could make another episode show choose direction story stick instead place mess
0	What's incredible? The large number of positive reviews. Having watched the whole series I can't see why so many have seen merit in this show. I am suspicious that some at least may not be genuine.The main characters are unconvincing. It is impossible to believe that Donny could lurch so often between extremes of success/elation and despair.I guess the explanation of this is that he and his tormentor are both severely disturbed. But I found it really tiresome.Does it have any merits? I suppose there is some value if it succeeds in directing other abuse sufferers to sources of help and advice. But I think most people don't watch Netflix to see public information films. I certainly don't. I'm looking for good drama and this wasn't.	incredible large number positive review watch whole series see many see merit show suspicious least may genuine main character unconvince impossible believe donny could lurch often extreme success elation despair guess explanation tormentor severely disturb find really tiresome merit suppose value succeed direct abuse sufferer source help advice think people watch netflix see public information film certainly look good drama

1	Let me say right off the bat that I'm not a fan of the video game series and only partially know about it. Watching this series, I was learning about the universe from scratch. And I liked something, but mostly not.I want to note the good visuals. A lot of different visual details related to the universe. Music and atmosphere in the spirit of the game. Good acting. And... that's it.I found the first episode terrible in so many ways, namely: the dialogs are strange, it looks dragged out, it's done well enough at the same time, but also with amateurish moments; the performances are clumsy, the soundtrack in some places didn't like, there are illogical moments of the script, and most importantly - the world doesn't seem natural. I can't believe in this world given the fantasy of what's going on until the very end of season 1, although it became more interesting to watch as the plot progressed. Sure, the script is pretty okay at some points, but for the most part it doesn't shine with reason. The graphics towards the end of season 1 are of lesser quality than in the beginning. To me, as a person completely unfamiliar with the universe, hyperbolizing, not explained from the first series about this world and how everything is arranged in detail. Having watched 1 season to the end, I'm sure that I don't understand all the things in the universe.The series is extremely overrated by video game fans, in my opinion. I don't see why the series has an 8.6 except for the visuals matching the universe, characters, music, and atmosphere. The authors tried to recreate the universe, and judging by the fans they succeeded, but the script of the series itself brings it down to the level of mediocre series, destroying the interest in such a story.	let say right bat fan video game series partially know watch series learn universe scratch like something mostly want note good visual lot different visual detail relate universe music atmosphere spirit game good act find first episode terrible many way namely dialog strange look drag do well enough time also amateurish moment performance clumsy soundtrack place like illogical moment script importantly world seem natural believe world give fantasy go end season although become interest watch plot progress sure script pretty okay point part shine reason graphic towards end season less quality begin person completely unfamiliar universe hyperbolize explain first series world everything arrange detail watch season end sure understand thing universe series extremely overrate video game fan opinion see series except visual match universe character music atmosphere author try recreate universe judge fan succeed script series bring level mediocre series destroy interest story

1	"I mean what genre are shows like The Boys or Santa Clarita. They aren't Black comedy but there's definitly a comedic thread here. I tried to stick through the pilot episode but it was hard. When it was over, I felt relieved.I'm not a gamer - although I did rescue the princess once in the early 90s. My only familiarity with the game Fallout is what I researched before writing this review. So I won't fit in to the 95% category of reviews here. But most sites describe it as anti Capitalist - which is ironic since here in the present we're the closest we've ever been to a nuclear war. But this series starts in the 1950s, like the game, where people were truly afraid of nuclear war. It was a different political climate, to say the least.From a purely entertainment perspective, this show has not captured my intrigue - at all. The war theme is up my ally but it's just all in the background so far - a glimpse at the helos; some bad mf in iron suits standing by like man servants; a trans ""brother"" referred to as ""their"". The bloodshed in pod 33 bordered on comical aided by the lois lane dumdum who suddenly knows how to handle a dart gun and survives by luck.Speaking of Lucy, she gets a knife in her abdomen where the blade is vertical but when she goes to staple the wound, it's now horizontal. Is this sloppy production or part of the comedy? I mean, it's so blaring, I'm honestly stumped.Although I'm not fond of the character, I can appreciate the determination and sheltered but diciplined mentality. I'm hoping she becomes a badarse. (Also just kind of glad we're past the whole leading lady must be Hispanic thing.)The pilot is presented in 4 sections to intro the various groups of characters, which I think was a poor decision. Traditionally, a pilot grabs your interest by investing in a handful of characters. It would have intrigued me more to have shorter glimpses with more focus on one group or other. Instead, it uses kind of a speed-dating technique. No one likes those.The pilot had an opportunity to focus on Maximus but his interesting dialog comes after an oddly long pause just in time to almost make the 5 min scene have some value. Until then he seems pretty superficial. But I can tell he's going to be an ingesting character.To summarize: too slow pace; too much comedic underpinning; boring sountrack; immature gore style.I don't think I'll be watching more but I thought that about Wheel of Time, too, then it hooked me - The 1st season (2nd Season not recommended). Is GoreCom a category?"	mean genre show like boy santa clarita black comedy definitly comedic thread try stick pilot episode hard feel relieve gamer although rescue princess early familiarity game fallout research write review fit category review sit describe anti capitalist ironic since present close ever nuclear war series start like game people truly afraid nuclear war different political climate say least purely entertainment perspective show capture intrigue war theme ally background far glimpse helos bad mf iron suit stand like man servant trans brother refer bloodshed pod border comical aid lois lane dumdum suddenly know handle dart gun survive luck speak lucy get knife abdomen blade vertical go staple wind horizontal sloppy production part comedy mean blare honestly stump although fond character appreciate determination shelter dicipline mentality hop become badarse also kind glad past whole lead lady must hispanic thing pilot present section intro various group character think poor decision traditionally pilot grab interest invest handful character would intrigue short glimpse focus one group instead use kind speed date technique one like pilot opportunity focus maximus interest dialog come oddly long pause time almost make min scene value seem pretty superficial tell go ingest character summarize slow pace much comedic underpin bore sountrack immature gore style think watch think wheel time hook st season nd season recommend gorecom category
1	This show started with a bang and kept all its promises for 4 seasons. Complex plot with amazing characters, dialogs with deep meaning and consequences, good cinematography and great writing. Season 5 and 6 were made after they ran out of source material and it shows a bit. Some episodes are outstanding however, and it makes out for some weaker plot lines. Season 7 and 8 are harder to watch as characters start to betray their own arcs. Dialogs are weak and the main plots don't make sense anymore. The cinematography is still great but the writing is getting worse and worse and the story feels rushed. The plot armor that was almost non existent in the beginning gets thicker and thicker. It's hard to watch such a great show end like this.In short, it is a great ride, but the landing is hard and messy.	show start bang keep promise season complex plot amaze character dialog deep mean consequence good cinematography great write season make run source material show bite episode outstanding however make weak plot line season hard watch character start betray arc dialog weak main plot make sense anymore cinematography still great write get bad bad story feel rush plot armor almost non existent begin get thick thick hard watch great show end like short great ride land hard messy

0	The premise of this show is about a man reliving his real life experiences of being stalked, and for the 3 three episodes it was exactly that. It was interesting seeing all the mad things this stalker did who was player very well by Jessica Gunning.From the 4th Episode on it went downhill quickly. The show just became about Richard Gadd's sexual experiences and all the mad things that had happened to him along with all the self pity you could fit into a mini series. It became boring and the stalker was hardly in it and in all honesty felt like a different show.By the end I couldn't even believe a lot of what happens was true, he's changed his name for the character which is suppose to be himself (like why?), won't say anything e.g. Reveal the identity of his stalker and just in general much of the story doesn't make sense at times.After starting well I wouldn't reccomend watching this unless you enjoy hearing about other peoples sexual experiences and all the self pity that comes with it.	premise show man relive real life experience stalk three episode exactly interest see mad thing stalker player well jessica gun th episode go downhill quickly show become richard gadd sexual experience mad thing happen along self pity could fit mini series become bore stalker hardly honesty feel like different show end even believe lot happen true change name character suppose like say anything e g reveal identity stalker general much story make sense time start well reccomend watch unless enjoy hear people sexual experience self pity come

1	Easy reviews first, the visuals are mostly bad, special mention to the chimp. The sound design is mostly good. Lighting is pretty standard and Netflixy but works.Not for more in-depth commentary. Actors are alright but mashing all characters into 6 or 7 main ones is pretty weird, when you think about it and the coincidences that occur. The characters they introduced like Tatiana are not well written. Jack Rooney is alright I guess.I liked Will and Jyn, but them being Yun Tianming and Cheng Xin feels rushed. Same with Saul being Luo Ji or Wade being born in the 20th century. I understand the need for introducing us to important characters early, but I dislike how they did this. Things happen so quickly that it becomes boring. Not once are the protagonist struggling with coming up with a solution. For example, Staircase? Dealt with in 5 minutes of screen time.Also, Augustina is one of the worst characters ever created. They tried making her this cold and cool clever girl while still having her being unstable and honestly pretty stupid in her relationships. Makes no sense.So yeah honestly I'm glad that's not my first introduction to this universe.	easy review first visual mostly bad special mention chimp sound design mostly good light pretty standard netflixy work depth commentary actor alright mash character main one pretty weird think coincidence occur character introduce like tatiana well write jack rooney alright guess like jyn yun tianme cheng xin feel rush saul luo ji wade bear th century understand need introduce we important character early dislike thing happen quickly become bore protagonist struggle come solution example staircase deal minute screen time also augustina one bad character ever create try make cold cool clever girl still unstable honestly pretty stupid relationship make sense yeah honestly glad first introduction universe

2	Shogun i a great show. I really liked the authenticity of the characters speaking Japanese, which significantly heightens immersion. However, the experience could be further enriched if conversations in various European languages were portrayed in their native tongues rather than solely in English. It feels somewhat incongruous when characters reference speaking Portuguese, for instance, yet converse in English. Similarly, the discrepancy is noticeable when Dutch sailors communicate in English aboard their merchant vessel. This inconsistency stands out, especially when contrasted with the meticulousness of the Japanese content.Despite only viewing a few episodes, the portrayal of scenes and the performances of the cast lend credibility to the narrative. The attention to detail in set design and costume, coupled with convincing performances, creates an immersive viewing experience. The characters feel authentic, and their interactions contribute to the overall believability of the story. Each scene unfolds with a sense of realism, drawing the audience deeper into the world of feudal Japan.	shogun great show really like authenticity character speak japanese significantly heighten immersion however experience could enrich conversation various european language portray native tongue rather solely english feel somewhat incongruous character reference speak portuguese instance yet converse english similarly discrepancy noticeable dutch sailor communicate english aboard merchant vessel inconsistency stand especially contrast meticulousness japanese content despite view episode portrayal scene performance cast lend credibility narrative attention detail set design costume couple convince performance create immersive view experience character feel authentic interaction contribute overall believability story scene unfold sense realism draw audience deep world feudal japan
1	From the start of the show there was some silly or goofy bad decisions.Such as putting blue contacts in the eyes of the actor that plays John Blackthorn. It makes him look like an alien or mermaid.I don't know if it's the actor or the directing but John Blackthorn is portrayed at a big goof. They made John into a fumbling fool. He is similar to Kelso from That 70s Show.This seems to be a story about one man's good luck. Actually it's more like great luck that never runs out.John Blackthorn doesn't earn anything. It seems as if this Mr Magoo like character stumbles into good fortune no matter how much he messes up.	start show silly goofy bad decision put blue contact eye actor play john blackthorn make look like alien mermaid know actor direct john blackthorn portray big goof make john fumble fool similar kelso show seem story one man good luck actually like great luck never run john blackthorn earn anything seem mr magoo like character stumble good fortune matter much mess
1	The first two seasons of The Rookie were probably among the best bits of televisison content I have seen in a while. Very fun, entertaining and enjoyable. The only issue I have had from the beginning is that the rookies participate in high risk situations from the very start. I find that bothering as it seems not very realistic. Overall I would still easily give S1-2 an 8 star rating.With Season 3 the series started to decline. Too much drama, too many high risk missions, officers with little experience participating in SWAT raids and undercover missions and even going on an unsanctioned mission abroad. I find that all to be a bit too much.This continued for S4 and S5 with the latter having very weak stories and character developement, leaning too heavily on action and seamingly tragic events. The season finales in particular are dissapointing as they continue to descent into unrealistic storytelling.As of March 24, I have high hopes for S6 which so far is looking good.Overall, I rate this series 7/10 as it does not uphold the quality of the first two seasons but 6/10 seems a bit harsh since it is still somewhat binge-worthy even in the later seasons.	first two season rookie probably among good bit televisison content see fun entertain enjoyable issue begin rookie participate high risk situation start find bother seem realistic overall would still easily give star rat season series start decline much drama many high risk mission officer little experience participate swat raid undercover mission even go unsanctioned mission abroad find bite much continue latter weak story character developement lean heavily action seamingly tragic event season finale particular dissapointing continue descent unrealistic storytelling march high hop far look good overall rate series uphold quality first two season seem bite harsh since still somewhat binge worthy even later season
1	When this show first started I used to watch I religiously. Oh, how I longed for new episodes and new seasons! I loved every character, each one had their own history and the writers made sure of well enough character development. And - of course - the medical drama was top notch, obviously a bit unrealistic at times while still holding up the dramatic value it had for the storyline.Whenever a main character died (and oh boy, did they die...), I was crying in front of my tv because I was so invested in this show.However... I had to stop watching after the plane crash in season 7 (? I don't even remember which season it was). At this point, it all felt way too unrealistic to be enjoyable anymore. Up until that season, the main characters had to endure so many traumatic life experiences that you would guess they would never set foot in that hospital ever again. The writers killed off main characters or important side characters, they let main characters have terrible diseases, near-death experiences, accidents, miscarriages... and the list goes on. It's honestly ridiculous and laughable.Used to be my favorite show of all time, now I can only assume it's a big piece of dreadful mess.	show first start use watch religiously oh long new episode new season love every character one history writer make sure well enough character development course medical drama top notch obviously bite unrealistic time still hold dramatic value storyline whenever main character die oh boy die cry front tv invest show however stop watch plane crash season even remember season point feel way unrealistic enjoyable anymore season main character endure many traumatic life experience would guess would never set foot hospital ever writer kill main character important side character let main character terrible disease near death experience accident miscarriage list go honestly ridiculous laughable use favorite show time assume big piece dreadful mess
2	Amazing how different the reviews are. Goes to show that it´s all in the eye of the beholder. If a show is 100% 1:1 on the basis material, why not just stick to the book? The characters in there are eminent beyond any adaptation, as they are your own creations. It is the magic stuff that cannot be replaced by any TV show or movie. So in reality, the ones reviewing based on truthfulness toward the books are pointing to something no-one can ever see; their own personal inner show. So far, the production is top notch, the actors doing a marvelous job and the whole tension build-up of the show feels very well made.	amaze different review go show eye beholder show basis material stick book character eminent beyond adaptation creation magic stuff replace tv show movie reality one review base truthfulness toward book point something one ever see personal inner show far production top notch actor marvelous job whole tension build show feel well make

1	First off I did not read the books or watch the previous series and I a at episode 7 at the moment, I love Hiroyuki Sanada, even from the trailes the scenery and cinematography seemed amazing, and then having over 9 stars in IMDB starting off, everything seemed promising, and you can tell there was a lot of care put into the show a lot of the details are very impressive and the violent scenes are very realistic and impacting for sure that was all well setup in the first episode, and I understand why a lot of the fans of the old Japanese culture would love this, I like it but I am no fan compared to these people, but after episode 7 I confirmed my worst fear, the writing got lazy and dumb.First of all I want to talk about the blackthorne actor, I really think he was a mistake, probably the worst one of the show, his voice is amazing but he should stick with voice acting, every scene he is on feels like an amateur trying to impress his dad, all his gestures, face expressions and movements are just a pain to watch not to mention he looks like a 14 year old on a giant body, he just looks too innocent to be the character he is trying to be and whats worse does some things that I think were meant to be badass but it just ended up looking ridiculous, stealing the light on all the other great elements of this show, not to mentio his character arc makes no sense, he kinda grows, but then he doesn't and goes back to being a primitive ape trying to seem ballsyAnd now as for the writing, the last straw for me was (SPOILER ALERT) a certain someone slipping to his death, is it supposed to be shocking? I guess it was, but probably on an unintended way, hell it was even funny to some degree but with things like these it's hard to take this show seriously and I really feel for those who did their best job to make this series great, their work is overshadowed primarily by Blackthorne and some of the writing confusing decisions, and this is coming from someone who is entirely new to this story, no books or previous TV series knowledge at all, but I hear they are making some dumb changes to the book and I think it is true.I am kinda hoping that these last few episodes and the seemingly dumb writing pays off in some way I am not able to understand yet, but right now that hope does not seem something worth holding on to. I am probably going to finish it anyway, it's not like it is too bad that it is intolerable either, but it is definitely overrated, I'd give it a 7.5, but I'm going with 6 simply because it does not deserve to be over 9 at this moment, I'd let an 8 pass, maybe even 8.5 knowing the strong wave of Japanese culture fans all over the world that would be blind to the negative aspects of the show, but 9 it's just an insult to other series that do deserve it. Feels like a ghost of Tsushima thing all over again, I also wanted to like it only to find out it was just a prettier assasin's creed with slightly better gameplay but it was nowhere near the masterpiece people seemed to think it was, even as far as believing it deserved game of the year over The Last of Us Part 2, just cuz they were not mature enough to appreciate a great story.	first read book watch previous series episode moment love hiroyuki sanada even trail scenery cinematography seem amaze star imdb start everything seem promise tell lot care put show lot detail impressive violent scene realistic impact sure well setup first episode understand lot fan old japanese culture would love like fan compare people episode confirm bad fear write get lazy dumb first want talk blackthorne actor really think mistake probably bad one show voice amaze stick voice act every scene feel like amateur try impress dad gesture face expression movement pain watch mention look like year old giant body look innocent character try what s bad thing think mean badass end look ridiculous steal light great element show mentio character arc make sense kinda grow go back primitive ape try seem ballsyand write last straw spoiler alert certain someone slip death suppose shock guess probably unintended way hell even funny degree thing like hard take show seriously really feel good job make series great work overshadow primarily blackthorne write confuse decision come someone entirely new story book previous tv series knowledge hear make dumb change book think true kinda hop last episode seemingly dumb write pay way able understand yet right hope seem something worth hold probably go finish anyway like bad intolerable either definitely overrate give go simply deserve moment let pass maybe even know strong wave japanese culture fan world would blind negative aspect show insult series deserve feel like ghost tsushima thing also want like find pretty assasin creed slightly well gameplay nowhere near masterpiece people seem think even far believe deserve game year last us part cuz mature enough appreciate great story

1	I have read all 3 books, the three-body problem, the dark forest and the immortal death. A trilogy worthy of the great literary works of science fiction (and I have read some) I saw the Chinese version television series (30 episodes) an excellent plot with a lot of scientific explanation. The characters are very endearing.I listened to Chinese music (WOW) a true masterpiece.Same creator did like with the end of Game of Thrones... :( Ok for the special effects which are better but cut too much from the story, not easy to follow for anyone who hasn't read the books.As for the music of Ramin Djawadi how not to be disappointed after what he had created in GOT.	read book three body problem dark forest immortal death trilogy worthy great literary work science fiction read see chinese version television series episode excellent plot lot scientific explanation character endear listen chinese music wow true masterpiece creator like end game throne ok special effect well cut much story easy follow anyone read book music ramin djawadi disappoint create get
0	Andrew Scott is an incredible actor, yet this film somehow doesn't sit right with me. The visuals are over-the-top and distract from the main story. The protagonist's lack of expressiveness makes him difficult to read, unlike Matt Damon's version which still managed to capture his humanity despite his flaws. Some might argue that the cold unpredictability in Andrew Scott's version offers a fresh perspective on the classic sociopath trope, but the lack of overall chemistry between the characters makes this remake altogether unimpressive. Perhaps if I hadn't seen the Matt Damon version, I'd have appreciated this more in its own right as an Art House-y modern film noir type.	andrew scott incredible actor yet film somehow sit right visual top distract main story protagonist lack expressiveness make difficult read unlike matt damon version still manage capture humanity despite flaw might argue cold unpredictability andrew scott version offer fresh perspective classic sociopath trope lack overall chemistry character make remake altogether unimpressive perhaps see matt damon version appreciate right art house modern film noir type

0	And that is the problem.I relay liked the book and the 1984 version. It was true to the book and the development of the characters was great.This time there is no development. Only spectacle.Where is the attempted suicide of Blacktorh. It's a pivot moment in the story. Because of that I whould never try to blackmail Marico into not committing sepuku, because he understood the need.There is almost nothing done with the crew anymore. In the book it is clear that blacktorn is getting more ja[panese and the crew not. Important for the development.Why should blackthorn leave toranaga. Makes no sense and it is not explained.Why the side line with his son trying to kill toranaga's brother. That makes no sense.The attack with the guns is laughable. No way the guns in that period could shoot that accurate.Even the cloth blacktorn is wearing. I can not imagine that a hatamoto whould wear them. Much to shaby.Why not have the portugese speak portugese, the dutch dutch etc.The screen writer did not understand the book and the subtile weaving of the plot.If you did not see the 1984 version or read the book, it's nice entertainment, but nothing more.	problem relay like book version true book development character great time development spectacle attempt suicide blacktorh pivot moment story whould never try blackmail marico commit sepuku understand need almost nothing do crew anymore book clear blacktorn get ja panese crew important development blackthorn leave toranaga make sense explain side line son try kill toranaga brother make sense attack gun laughable way gun period could shoot accurate even cloth blacktorn wear imagine hatamoto whould wear much shaby portugese speak portugese dutch dutch etc screen writer understand book subtile weave plot see version read book nice entertainment nothing
1	"This is a very uneven show. Some parts are thrilling and compelling... some meander and don't make sense. Some casting is spot on while some irritated me the entire time. I can't say I would be excited about a season 2. I never read the book but the show centers on 5 or 6 smart ""scientists"" dealing with the aftermath of a collapse of science. The main character Auggie -- a scientist who is supposed to be starting a nanotech company. Too bad she looks like a 23 year old supermodel who I don't buy as a scientist for a second. There is also some of the famous D&D poor writing with a dumbing down of the story as you can see they only allude to complicated subjects but never go into them. Then there is the idea that just about everything in the world just happens to happen to this 5 or 6 person friend group in London. Not buying it. There is also a plot line that goes over 6 or so of the episodes that, in the end, comes to nothing. Super uneven. There is just honestly no one to root for in this story even with actors doing their level best."	uneven show part thrill compel meander make sense cast spot irritate entire time say would excite season never read book show center smart scientist deal aftermath collapse science main character auggie scientist suppose start nanotech company bad look like year old supermodel buy scientist second also famous poor write dumbe story see allude complicate subject never go idea everything world happen happen person friend group london buy also plot line go episode end come nothing super uneven honestly one root story even actor level well

2	I was 10/10 on this, got very into the series initially and was thinking of it a lot, always looking forward to that next episode. Very well directed and written, the camera effect was sometimes not to my liking but gave a unique style so that didnt bother me too much. However, I found the ending to be somewhat anti-climatic, the 9th episode was amazing and kinda feels like the last episode was some weird epilogue. Also the first half of the series had a great build up, then it started feeling like nothing was gonna happen. And nothing did happen.. sort off, action and war/battle wise. I dont need battles and sieges but it felt of after having that build up.. even in the intro showing war and sieges.	get series initially think lot always look forward next episode well direct write camera effect sometimes like give unique style do not bother much however find end somewhat anti climatic th episode amaze kinda feel like last episode weird epilogue also first half series great build start feel like nothing go to happen nothing happen sort action war battle wise do not need battle siege feel build even intro show war siege
2	Overall the series deliver solid entertainment. I've read the books, watched the Chinese adaptation and did not expect the Netflix series to completely align with the book as the material is quite extensive. The books are one of the best in the sci-fi genre, I highly recommend reading them. The Netflix series manages to capture the essence of the books, however in a much watered down version. In my opinion a few more episodes could have been added to extend the storyline.I understand the reasoning behind the character changes which work fairly well in most cases and thus might appeal to a wider audience. Some of the actors are spot on, including Ye Wenjie, Da Shi, Jin Cheng and Thomas Wade. Unfortunately Auggie Salazar is totally off for me. She's supposed to be a top scientist but the over the top acting completely ruins the believability of the character. I could not relate to her at all and was impatiently waiting for her scenes to end. Too bad, as the rest of the cast works well together and delivers a smooth performance.The special effects are well done and enhance the storytelling which is big plus these days. The music was a bit of a letdown for me, nothing memorable here; in comparison, the Chinese adaptation has excellent music choices.I do recommend watching the series but don't expect it to be as scientifically engaging as the books.	overall series deliver solid entertainment read book watch chinese adaptation expect netflix series completely align book material quite extensive book one good sci fi genre highly recommend read netflix series manage capture essence book however much water version opinion episode could add extend storyline understand reason behind character change work fairly well case thus might appeal wide audience actor spot include ye wenjie da shi jin cheng thomas wade unfortunately auggie salazar totally suppose top scientist top act completely ruin believability character could relate impatiently wait scene end bad rest cast work well together deliver smooth performance special effect well do enhance storytelle big plus day music bite letdown nothing memorable comparison chinese adaptation excellent music choice recommend watch series expect scientifically engage book

0	I've not read the book and I've not watched the original mini series so I have no legacy investment. I watched this mainly because of the trailers and because of Hiroyuki Sanada's presence. First, the sub titles and English masquerading as Portuguese, if this is your problem then maybe you need to have a word with your inner racist. The sub titles aren't a problem it just means you have to watch and listen rather than being on your phone, as to English standing in for the Portuguese that would have been spoken, well good luck finding the audience that will endure subtitles for both Japanese and Portuguese speech. No, the real problem with this is the unfathomable plot strands and the central notion of a washed up English trader/pirate being important in a Japanese clan war. Non of the plot makes sense and the script is excruciating and no amount of bowing and being inscrutable can save it. A number of the players will be familiar to western audiences, the aforementioned Sanada has been in a lot of western productions, Anna Sawai & Takehiro Hira are both in Monarch, Legacy of Monsters, and Tadanobu Asano has a number of western productions under his belt, so this isn't amateur night. Unfortunately their lines don't help them deliver a coherent story and Cosmo Janis as the white saviour 'lead' further hampers things with a fairly uninspiring performance. Only two episodes have dropped so far but they were enough, I'm out.On an historical note, in 1600 Spain & Portugal were one kingdom ruled from Spain and the threat to their trade came from the Dutch (it wasn't called Holland!) not England.	read book watch original mini series legacy investment watch mainly trailer hiroyuki sanada presence first sub title english masquerade portuguese problem maybe need word inner racist sub title problem mean watch listen rather phone english stand portuguese would speak well good luck find audience endure subtitle japanese portuguese speech real problem unfathomable plot strand central notion wash english trader pirate important japanese clan war non plot make sense script excruciate amount bow inscrutable save number player familiar western audience aforementione sanada lot western production anna sawai takehiro hira monarch legacy monster tadanobu asano number western production belt amateur night unfortunately line help deliver coherent story cosmo janis white saviour lead hamper thing fairly uninspire performance two episode drop far enough historical note spain portugal one kingdom rule spain threat trade come dutch call holland england

It is not fun to watch the hero of the show, Nolan and his fellow officers have their balls taken away from them by black citizens every 5 minutes. Then after being reprimanded they look like whipped puppies and cover their heads in shame for being white. This is divisive garbage intended to make white police officers feel ashamed and encourage black people to be thankless and feel victimized even when officers are offering them help. This episode just made me feel irritated because it seemed to be anti-cop while at the same time being a cop show. Asinine.	episode suck hard sure hell hope future show need tv show teach wake politic want watch good show entertain fun watch hero show nolan fellow officer ball take away black citizen every minute reprimand look like whip puppy cover head shame white divisive garbage intend make white police officer feel ashamed encourage black people thankless feel victimize even officer offer help episode make feel irritate seem anti cop time cop show asinine

They seem to present the era nicely and give this... ""Vibe"", I guess. It somehow feels realistic, even though it probably is not, if you look closer.Unfortunately, for me, that's all there is. I did not get a connection with any of the characters showed in the first episode, and for the most part I was wondering ""what is this show really about?"". I get it, that it's a slow-burn, that does work in some shows and movies, but I am not sure it works here, especially, since the show is about a conman.I am not saying it should be running at a much higher pace, essentially turning into a short movie, no. But there are just so many shots, that do not enrich the story in any way, let alone move it forward. They look amazing, yes, but from narrative perspective they are mostly pointless."	show definitely style talk black n white film may consider enough call medium art house camera work decoration costume seem present era nicely give vibe guess somehow feel realistic even though probably look close unfortunately get connection character show first episode part wonder show really get slow burn work show movie sure work especially since show conman say run much high pace essentially turn short movie many shot enrich story way let alone move forward look amaze yes narrative perspective mostly pointless
0	"Someone else in here characterized it well already, they try way too hard. Way too hard for this to be received as anything of substance. Ripley alone as a character study might have worked, but then when the interactions start to pick up in the plot, you realize that this is a piece created by try hards for people selfidentifying as ""cultured"" who just have to sing the praises of a work, because its black and white (which nowadays is not less expensive to film). And tonedeath.As soon as the dialogue delivery starts between the characters, everything is off. Every glance lasts for the usual 5 seconds after it has seized becoming a glance. Every telegraphed ""you are not welcome here"" gets the extra 15 headnods while the actor really sells the delivery and sells it, and sells it, and sells it - and keeps selling it. Even the self recognition, of ok, you know that I cant paint, but you are being polite somehow manages to come in just minutes after its appropriate delivery time... Its not like the actors are bad essentially, but like they were told to ""hold that emotion"" so the typical Netflix customer has a chance to ""catch the emotion on that face"".At that point all of the deliveries seize to be mediocre and just venture full into bad, which is then underlined by atmosphere heavy scenes, of listening to some chanteuse in a bar where the focus is on capturing her face and everyone being captured by their self indulgent righteousness of experiencing that picturesque moment of consuming an espresso in that venue - but no one cared enough not to hire the directors girlfriend for the singing part.Sure, if you are the target audience of this, which has to be the tonedeath, asocial beings that Gen-Z are often mischaracterized as today, I guess you love this for all the gravitas it comes with -- but if you are anyone that isnt a self indulgent art lover to the maximum, its hard to see yourself putting up with this neurotic, depressing version of Ripley for more than the appropriate one and a half minutes while your ogling the god darn exit to get out of that social interaction.This is not a display of a sadly all too likeable psychopath - this is the little wished to be on Apple TV show that fulfills the wish of half of their audience, to at least for once in their life, be able to read an emotion off of someones face - while giving them the impression that ""asocial"" is the totally new social and accepted, and ""no you are perfectly fine in this interaction"" if you just take that trip to italy to meet your dream upperclass prince, that always waited for you and you always wanted to have a seemingly meaningful conversation with...I'll revisit this review, once I've finished watching the series, but just getting through the next scene has become a chore here...And yet I'm absolutely sure that the mediocraty in filmlovers will love this - because it made them feel some emotions in every scene!

The main characters are mostly great, with a few exceptions, and the story is ok. All in all it feels like the show finds it pace and the characters feels settled in the last couple of episodes. It bodes great for the second season!There are however a few things that don't sit right with me, the major thing being the ghouls in the games have always been explained by radiation, but in the show people are made into ghouls by a some concoction.All in all a good show worth seeing even if you've never played the games!	adaptation universe take place close perfect location spot definitely feel like fallout main character mostly great exception story ok feel like show find pace character feel settle last couple episode bode great second season however thing sit right major thing ghoul game always explain radiation show people make ghouls concoction good show worth see even never play game
1	This guy seems very confused, both in the show and in real life. He talks about being groomed, yet isn't even aware of the definition of grooming and how it has to involve a minor. It's a huge insult to abuse victims everywhere. On top of that, attempting to make a stalker sympathetic is a horrible choice. It's not their fault? They're simply mentally ill? I've got news for you, being mentally ill doesn't make you sympathetic or a victim in and of itself, especially if it involves a personality disorder you can't treat, or the fact that medicating a person doesn't change who they are aside from tiring them out. Most people don't make the poor choices that lead them to being stalked as in this case where he basically insinuates that some people bring it on themselves. Well, he certainly did! He absolutely should be embarrassed by his life choices which are now insulting women and men alike by assuming his experiences in any way relate to others. This show isn't progressive, it's regressive. It has you nearly constantly cringing at the bad humor, intense and triggering scenes, and poorly worded narration excusing most of the behaviors. The actress playing Martha is so convincing, she's the only reason to keep watching. At least the show draws a better conclusion than the main character's real life story.	guy seem confuse show real life talk groom yet even aware definition groom involve minor huge insult abuse victim everywhere top attempt make stalker sympathetic horrible choice fault simply mentally ill get news mentally ill make sympathetic victim especially involve personality disorder treat fact medicate person change aside tire people make poor choice lead stalk case basically insinuate people bring well certainly absolutely embarrass life choice insult woman man alike assume experience way relate other show progressive regressive nearly constantly cringe bad humor intense trigger scene poorly word narration excuse behavior actress play martha convince reason keep watch least show draw well conclusion main character real life story
1	Well the first couple of seasons where good! Game of Thrones has magic, dragons, action, and drama; with a hard does of x rated scenes and nudity. Game of Thrones has H B O movie quality, sets, and A list actors. Game of Thrones follows a good mix with some of England's history which give a real feel for the major story line mixed in with magically fantasy. (ie the wall the Romans built around Scotland) Like The Sopranos H B O made a fresh, cutting edge, and raw series. Regrettably the later years of the series becomes formulated, redundant, and hemmed in; much like the Walking Dead series. Does anyone watch the Walking Dead anymore? Well the killing off of lead characters, and introduction of new characters creates new life for a series. Regrettable the second half of Game of Thrones loses steam like most series. 7 out of 10 stars.	well first couple season good game throne magic dragon action drama hard x rat scenes nudity game throne h b movie quality set list actor game throne follow good mix england history give real feel major story line mix magically fantasy ie wall romans build around scotland like soprano h b make fresh cut edge raw series regrettably later year series become formulate redundant hem much like walk dead series anyone watch walk dead anymore well kill lead character introduction new character create new life series regrettable second half game throne lose steam like series star
2	This show was a lot of fun to watch when the original cast were there, but as the seasons went on, and character after character were killed off, it lost its charm. Few of the newer cast are interesting to watch, with the exception of Amelia, whose neurotic behavior is just hilarious when you consider she's a neurosurgeon... When they killed off everyone in Meredith's family, there just wasn't enough to keep me watching. Lexie was the last straw!	show lot fun watch original cast season go character character kill lose charm new cast interest watch exception amelia whose neurotic behavior hilarious consider neurosurgeon kill everyone meredith family enough keep watch lexie last straw
2	I'm sure everyone has heard about Shogun by now but if you haven't, what are you waiting for? It's basically Game of Thrones in feudal Japan but that description really sells it short. It's better than that.Instead of having a fantasy society to build, it delves into the real society of feudal Japan, with its own set of stringent rules that sometimes can seem alien and incomprehensible to the single European in the story who is a major character, John Blackthorne.Blackthorne starts as a churlish pirate/sailor (though he disputes being a pirate) and over the course of the season, evolves tremendous growth. The other major characters have amazing journeys of their own: Toranaga, a descendant of ancient Shoguns, who is suspected by others in the samurai class of wanting to revive that title; and Lady Mariko, a steely, intelligent and elegant interpreter for Blackthorne.Don't be put off by the fact that the dialogue is almost all subtitled Japanese. You get used to it quickly.Supposedly this is a miniseries but I don't believe it. It's too popular and where the story ends feels like a prelude to a bigger story.	sure everyone hear shogun wait basically game throne feudal japan description really sell short well instead fantasy society build delve real society feudal japan set stringent rule sometimes seem alien incomprehensible single european story major character john blackthorne blackthorne start churlish pirate sailor though dispute pirate course season evolve tremendous growth major character amaze journey toranaga descendant ancient shogun suspect other samurai class want revive title lady mariko steely intelligent elegant interpreter blackthorne put fact dialogue almost subtitle japanese get use quickly supposedly miniserie believe popular story end feel like prelude big story
1	Just becomes kinda boringThe black & white photography is intense and spectacular. The setting is moody and gothicBut it soon becomes plodding and drab. There is no dramatic tension.Andrew Scott is fascinating, but too obviously psychopathic, the spectre of Moriarty looms over him, so there is little surprise where his character is headedFlynn is lacking any charisma. Fanning is distant. No characters drew me in.For me, it is severely lacking against the 'Talented Mr Ripley' movie. Matt Damon was twitchy, envious and desperate. Scott just seems robotic.Got to episode 4. I will stick with it, but I feel it will be a slog.	become kinda boringthe black white photography intense spectacular set moody gothicbut soon become plod drab dramatic tension andrew scott fascinate obviously psychopathic spectre moriarty loom little surprise character headedflynn lack charisma fan distant character draw severely lack talente mr ripley movie matt damon twitchy envious desperate scott seem robotic get episode stick feel slog

I am only rating these sections of Greys Anatomy because after episode 4 of season 9 I stopped watching because the show had dropped off big time with quality which is why I don't watch it anymore. After the significant death that occurs at the beginning of season 9 that was my tipping point I couldn't watch it anymore - let's just say it was one of my favourite characters. That was the last straw for me. Now I just rewatch the show up to season 9 because it's soooo good!! Do yourself a favour and watch it - just don't go past the early eps of season 9 because you'll be disappointed.	see show start watch right early season absolute gold good show ever rat see grey anatomy season episode season episode season rat section grey anatomy episode season stop watch show drop big time quality watch anymore significant death occur begin season tip point watch anymore let say one favourite character last straw rewatch show season soooo good favour watch go past early eps season disappoint
1	Game of thrones seasons 1-4 is probably some of, if not THE absolute best television i have ever seen. BUT When only half the show is great i cant give it a 9- or 10/10. Season 5 truly is a mediocre season. Probably a 7 or 8 out of 10. Perhaps a 6,5 in some areas. Then we get to season 6. Season six is without a doubt the most controversial season of the show overall. In my opinion, 70% of it is meh, 20% trash, and 10% best television ever made. I dont really like season six, but i dont hate it either. There was just some decisions made during production that makes No sense from neither a storytelling or a character perspective.Now. The Meat and potatoes. Season 7 is absolutely horrendous. No, i do not want to listen to People that say that 8 is the only terrible season from a writing standpoint. Its not. They both suck ass. The only reasons that 8 is worse is because 1: Its the finale and it sucked. 2: People were getting their hopes up quite a lot for season 8 only to have Them shattered In a more obvious Way. Once you stop to Think, season 7 becomes almost as bad. People teleporting, characters being reduced to nothing.Season 8 is the same as season seven, only Its the final season so the argument could easily have been made that Its worse, but not only in the quality of writing. Every character that had not already been thrown out of the window in the span of season 5-7 gets thrown out the window in season 8.

2	I am certain in these reviews someone is moaning about the lack of realism but who cares. The show is eminently watchable, if you want realism join the force, it's 98% boring. The show is entertaining. Our old friend Nathan always brings a sense of humor to the roles he plays. The first episode of the second season starts with a bang but I do miss Afton Williamson as Bishop. She was my favorite of the three training officers. I know she had some problem but I hope she finds a new role somewhere. If you enjoyed the first season you will enjoy this one.	certain review someone moan lack realism care show eminently watchable want realism join force bore show entertain old friend nathan always bring sense humor role play first episode second season start bang miss afton williamson bishop favorite three train officer know problem hope find new role somewhere enjoy first season enjoy one

2	Game of Thrones boasts an intricate plot with complex characters, stunning cinematography, and intense action sequences, especially its many battles and fights. It's hard to deny that it wasn't a cultural phenomenon that captivated me and many others for eight seasons.I've rated Game of Thrones a nine out of ten for its well-written and multi-layered storytelling, and its fantastic production value. However, despite still having amazing visuals and extremely high production value, like many fans, I was disappointed and to an extent frustrated by the final season's storytelling and how certain plot points were handled, which has lowered my rating from a ten to a nine. Despite this, Game of Thrones still remains for me a must-watch series and I would still highly recommend it to any fan of the fantasy or drama genre in general.	game throne boast intricate plot complex character stun cinematography intense action sequence especially many battle fight hard deny cultural phenomenon captivate many other eight season rat game throne nine ten well write multi layer storytelle fantastic production value however despite still amaze visual extremely high production value like many fan disappoint extent frustrate final season storytelle certain plot point handle low rat ten nine despite game throne still remain must watch series would still highly recommend fan fantasy drama genre general

0	"When it started, Game of Thrones was one of the most stunning and cinematic television series ever. The scope was breathtaking, the fights were exciting yet realistic, the characters were complex, the acting was great, and the writing was fantastic. It was one of the most shocking shows on television and you never knew who would die next! It was great.But then Season 8 happened.I'm willing to defend the first half of the season. Yes, even ""The Long Night"", as it was still breathtaking to watch despite the premature conclusion and dark lighting. However, the next episode cut corners and ultimately seemed too rushed. Even then, i had hope the series could return to its former glory.Ah, you poor, naïve child.Little did I know the last two episode weres not only rushed, but sacrificed almost a decades worth of character development, just for cheap shock value. It felt like an insult not just to me, but to all the fans who were on board with this show since day one, and even to loyal fans of the books series.And then the finale.I'm not going to even talk about it.It doesn't deserve words.GOT is dead, and I'll never be able to see it again.For those of you who have never seen it before, I warn you. Watch something else. Watch something like Breaking Bad, or The Sopranos, or Mad Men, or literally any other show in existence that has a better and more faithful conclusion than this one.

But then your mum or dad got bored when they saw you were getting a little bit sleepy. All of a sudden the story ended - they lived happily ever after (or they all died). I would have preferred to have fallen asleep rather than suffer through this disappointing end.

Anyone with a brain can google MLK quotes, and you'll know they're not the same thing at all. Even Malcom X would be ashamed as he warned of the dangers of a white liberal.Grey's would have been much better off if they focused on developing the characters and stories instead of the tired ""let's kill Meredith and bring her back"" and pushing their personal politics...ESPECIALLY if they can't even push them accurately. You can talk about issues and tell the stories of those who have gone through them without making it feel like you're watching the reeducation camp collection that focuses on brainwashing instead of actually making it good.

0	Baby Reindeer is billed as a darkly comic thriller about a man dealing with a stalker. In reality, it's a show about a man who just cannot get out of his own way. The main character is constitutionally incapable of making good decisions, or even neutral ones. Exhibit A: In episode 1, he meets a woman who is, from the word 'Go' quite clearly a quivering mass of psychological red flags teetering on the brink of madness. He then discovers that she's a compulsive liar who served four years in prison for stalking, beating up an old woman, more stalking, making false reports to child services, and, oh yeah, even more stalking. Ask yourself, what would a normal person do when confronted with that information? If you answered 'Friend the stalker on Facebook', you and the main character would probably get on famously. In fact, you'd probably end up stalking each other.This is a show about a man who spends about six months repeatedly sledgehammering himself in the nuts and then complaining that his nuts hurt. If that's your cup of tea, I hope you enjoy it. Unfortunately, it wasn't mine, so I didn't.	baby reindeer bill darkly comic thriller man deal stalker reality show man get way main character constitutionally incapable make good decision even neutral one exhibit episode meet woman word go quite clearly quiver mass psychological red flag teeter brink madness discover compulsive liar serve four year prison stalk beat old woman stalk make false report child service oh yeah even stalk ask would normal person confront information answer friend stalker facebook main character would probably get famously fact probably end stalk show man spend six month repeatedly sledgehammer nut complain nut hurt cup tea hope enjoy unfortunately mine
1	"Created by Geneva Roberts and Graham Wagner for Amazon Prime, we follow Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), an underground vault dweller hundreds of years after nuclear war has destroyed most the surface of the globe. A story familiar for fans of the games, Lucy must adventure to the surface to rescue her father and discover what kind of civilization is left intact in the irradiated, monster-ridden world above. As a show there are considerable shortcomings, but ultimately quite a good time. A franchise based around heavy world building the show hits the ground running introducing us to the lore and the backstory, through the lens of 4 or so characters in places and times. Again for those already familiar with the games this rapid catch-up may seem fine, however a series introduction the opening is considerably blocky, with strange pacing, and frankly weird dialogue. As someone who has played much of the games, there's a lot to be said on the production choices around which were to give that ""video game"" feel, however I don't like many of those choices, personally. Characters only interacts as if its a Bethesda engine, lots of standing and talking, sitting and talking, or walking and talking. Characters never have business, or things to practically do, in scenes. And the opposite, during any scenes of movement or action montages we get basically zero dialogue, sometimes for minutes at a time. If really does feel like watching a video game at points, in a subtle way the bad first-person scenes in the new Halo adaptation didn't even capture. However these choices may certainly appeal to some and they certainly seem to, totally fair. There are also tons of references to things across all the games, which was neat, although ascetically its of course continuing into the heavier saturation, Todd Howard version of the Fallout universe, most prominent now in the styles of the games 76 and Shelter, which again of course makes sense as he serves as a producer. Some practical props were hit and miss, as was the CGI. Things in scenes and backgrounds tended to look great, however hero props the characters actually held were often very cardboard / rubber looking. And I don't wanna talk about the de-aging CGI. Narratively as we progress the series improves although as story twist after story twist comes, especially towards the end, I didn't mind them, they just rarely felt justified by what lead up to it. That said the set pieces and wardrobe are all great, I was extremely impressed. Acting is all suitable, Purnell as Lucy was good, I of course loved Walton Goggins' performance. Ultimately a pretty fun story that does eventually come together once it gets going, although I expect may be a bit confusing or lacking for those completely unfamiliar with the lore from the games. I liked it, didn't love it, but will definitely check out the next season whenever that comes."	create geneva roberts graham wagner amazon prime follow lucy maclean ella purnell underground vault dweller hundred year nuclear war destroy surface globe story familiar fan game lucy must adventure surface rescue father discover kind civilization leave intact irradiate monster ride world show considerable shortcoming ultimately quite good time franchise base around heavy world build show hit grind run introduce we lore backstory lens character place time already familiar game rapid catch may seem fine however series introduction open considerably blocky strange pace frankly weird dialogue someone play much game lot say production choice around give video game feel however like many choice personally character interact bethesda engine lot stand talk sit talk walk talk character never business thing practically scene opposite scene movement action montage get basically zero dialogue sometimes minute time really feel like watch video game point subtle way bad first person scene new halo adaptation even capture however choice may certainly appeal certainly seem totally fair also ton reference thing across game neat although ascetically course continue heavy saturation todd howard version fallout universe prominent style game shelter course make sense serve producer practical prop hit miss cgi thing scene background tend look great however hero prop character actually hold often cardboard rubber look wan na talk de age cgi narratively progress series improve although story twist story twist come especially towards end mind rarely feel justify lead say set piece wardrobe great extremely impress act suitable purnell lucy good course love walton goggin performance ultimately pretty fun story eventually come together get go although expect may bite confuse lack completely unfamiliar lore game like love definitely check next season whenever come
1	"Initially, I was preparing for complete failure (today this is the default state). But in anticipation of bad things, surprisingly nothing bad happened. Quite a normal plot (even classic regarding the ""main plot action""). There is no absurd break in the narrative, no strong pull on topics that we would not like to see. Walton Goggins works at 476% and pleases the eyes.A pleasant abundance of fan service, music, costumes, merch and more things like this (sometimes its just looks too ""clean"" for this world and the feeling that they were filming with what they could dig up on ali or ebay for 500 bottle caps)The biggest disadvantage is that there is no atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world and a series of games, there is almost no flair of the culture of America in the 60s. At least there isn't that hopelessness and decay of F1-2. Just regular modern people speaking about regular problems.The actors talk, looks and act like ordinary modern people drinking cappuccino in the center of New York 10 minutes ago. (except experienced ones like Goggins)In our modern world, you will probably find places that look worse and people who have more problems than in this world.Sometimes, against the backdrop of clean suits and regular acting, you will think that YouTubers have made high-quality fan fiction.The series is perfect for those who are not a big fan of realistic post-apocalyptic films, games and books, but loves the comedy of light absurdity. Who wants to look at the surroundings and a fresh perspective on this topic."	initially prepare complete failure today default state anticipation bad thing surprisingly nothing bad happen quite normal plot even classic regard main plot action absurd break narrative strong pull topic would like see walton goggin work please eye pleasant abundance fan service music costume merch thing like sometimes look clean world feel film could dig ali ebay bottle cap big disadvantage atmosphere post apocalyptic world series game almost flair culture america least hopelessness decay f regular modern people speak regular problem actor talk look act like ordinary modern people drink cappuccino center new york minute ago except experience one like goggin modern world probably find place look bad people problem world sometimes backdrop clean suit regular act think youtuber make high quality fan fiction series perfect big fan realistic post apocalyptic film game book love comedy light absurdity want look surround fresh perspective topic

The saying ""flogging/beating a dead horse"" was practically made for shows like Grey's Anatomy. This, coming from a long time fan of Grey's Anatomy and Shonda Rhimes (the way she phrased some lines - made it sound quite philosophical or even a modern spiritual teacher - if you will). That being said... I do believe she did a lot of good and touched a lot of hearts (mine included) - with her way of putting things into perspective. And i respect her for that. But... that's also why it's quite saddening and disappointing - to see a show i used to rate a solid 10/10 - trading quality for quantity to this extent. Can't give it more than a 7 in its current state - tho, even this ratting is mainly influenced by past content (it's higher for what it used to be). Anyway, episode 16 of season 16 - proved to be the final nail in the coffin for me.The show should be long dead - but some fans seem to find it hard to let it go (some say that's the only reason it's prolonged into continuous degradation)."	try really try see whole show amount absurdity surround certain event pille beyond form common sense say flog beat dead horse practically make show like grey anatomy come long time fan grey anatomy shonda rhime way phrase line make sound quite philosophical even modern spiritual teacher say believe lot good touch lot heart mine include way put thing perspective respect also quite sadden disappoint see show use rate solid trade quality quantity extent give current state tho even rat mainly influence past content high use anyway episode season prove final nail coffin show long dead fan seem find hard let go say reason prolong continuous degradation
1	"I haven't read the book, but I eagerly awaited the series, so I did some research on the topic and learned about it before the series aired. Firstly, I must say that I found the acting weak. While Liam Cunningham's performance was good, the rest of the acting remained mediocre. The concept excited me, and the first two episodes were promising, but the pace gradually declined afterwards. Especially, the scenes of ""Will's love"" and ""Saul's Let's smoke concept"" exhausted me, so I fast-forwarded through those parts. Two or three episodes of the series were unnecessarily devoted to ""Will,"" which was a waste. Although I couldn't get enough of Eiza Gonzalez's beauty, I couldn't grasp the image of a nanotechnology genius character, which detached me from the reality within the series. Whenever I saw Eiza, I felt again like I was watching a TV show. I expected the season finale to be more thrilling. In short, I was saddened by the wasted potential of such a beautiful concept, but if you have spare time and enjoy science fiction, it's still worth watching."	read book eagerly await series research topic learn series air firstly must say find act weak liam cunningham performance good rest act remain mediocre concept excite first two episode promise pace gradually decline afterwards especially scene love saul let smoke concept exhaust fast forward part two three episode series unnecessarily devote waste although get enough eiza gonzalez beauty grasp image nanotechnology genius character detach reality within series whenever see eiza feel like watch tv show expect season finale thrill short sadden waste potential beautiful concept spare time enjoy science fiction still worth watch
2	I read the original novel this series is based upon. It is an awesome cultural journey of a Vietnamese man, who is half French. He is a double, triple agent, betrayed and abused by all sides but a man who is curiously resilient and talented. The cast is just great. This is not a Vietnam war story, it is an aftermath story. A brilliant telling of the Vietnam story by Vietnamese. The one great tragedy here is that the original novel has the protagonist going from RVN to Franc, not America. America has almost no presence in the novel. So putting the story over in America is going to change the entire story arc, and this may not be a good thing. Really to bad the producers chose this route. At any rate this is an important story where we here from Vietnam, a story arc long overdue.	read original novel series base upon awesome cultural journey vietnamese man half french double triple agent betray abuse side man curiously resilient talented cast great vietnam war story aftermath story brilliant tell vietnam story vietnamese one great tragedy original novel protagonist go rvn franc america america almost presence novel put story america go change entire story arc may good thing really bad producer choose route rate important story vietnam story arc long overdue
0	Liu Cixin's trilogy is as grandiose as Author C Clarke's books, the important element of hard core science fiction which expand over thousands years in history, is that it is focused on humantiy as a whole, not on individual or personal life, or private life. And a very important idea is normal people, even though they didn't know or meet each other, come together to the same goal, save humanity from alien invasion. However. And as humans are complicated, it is never about right or wrong, good or evil. However, netflix as its usual limited understanding, put the narrative as black or white, good or evil, binary thinking. And only english speaking people can save the world, a small circle of people who at exford, who know each other, alcohol, drug, f-words, psycholocal trouble, self-doubting, etc. Do people really put the future in these high school drama people's hands, seriously??? And there is a missing element from the original book, time distilled see things in a picture way, something that wasn't translated in English.	liu cixin trilogy grandiose author c clarke book important element hard core science fiction expand thousand year history focus humantiy whole individual personal life private life important idea normal people even though know meet come together goal save humanity alien invasion however human complicate never right wrong good evil however netflix usual limit understand put narrative black white good evil binary think english speak people save world small circle people exford know alcohol drug f word psycholocal trouble self doubt etc people really put future high school drama people hand seriously miss element original book time distil see thing picture way something translate english

I guess if the writers didn't wanna finish it fast and all the books from George R R Martin were published things would be different..

I did not find myself in suspense at all for the next episodes to be released.The episodes often drag out and get boring due to long, often pointless, scenes. Yet, ironically the actual timeline of events moves at a lightning pace.

They butchered the most imprtant characters, and they either deleted them or split them into more characters, most of them american.They ignored 99% of the hard philosophical themes and questions.They ignored the hundreds of years gap. They invented dramas that do not exist, just for the sake of drama.They butchered the whole story. It is one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen.

1	I love the look of this show. It's moody, it's dark, and while the landscape is not quite Japan, the Canadian wilderness is a decent analog. But looks can't carry everything, and the cracks are starting to show.The shogunate depicted is based less in history, but rather the obsession with a stoicism Western audiences associated with Japan during the early 20th century.The audience insert (notably British) is set up to see straight through this, and brings his enlightened views to the town he is gifted by Toranaga. It's a classic story as old as Hollywood, and it saddens me to see this trope rehashed time and time again.Perhaps it's that almost every Japanese character seems to be like some kind of cheesy anime character, either stoic, a buffoon, or a cackling villain. What little we see of the average worker is sweet or placid, a wallflower for Blackthorne to bounce off of in his classic rejection of stereotypical cultural tropes.I'm not asking for much, perhaps a little bit of insubordination. Because this period of time in history books was full of people breaking the mold in Japanese society. A mildly outspoken commoner, perhaps an unruly peasant. Just something to show that people were still people.Anyway, it's a nice looking show, and a little better than the days of movies like The Last Samurai. But it's got a long way to go, because the reliance on common stereotypes shows the lack of passion to depict people in a realistic and human way.	love look show moody dark landscape quite japan canadian wilderness decent analog look carry everything crack start show shogunate depict base less history rather obsession stoicism western audience associate japan early th century audience insert notably british set see straight bring enlighten view town gift toranaga classic story old hollywood sadden see trope rehash time time perhaps almost every japanese character seem like kind cheesy anime character either stoic buffoon cackle villain little see average worker sweet placid wallflower blackthorne bounce classic rejection stereotypical cultural trope ask much perhaps little bite insubordination period time history book full people break mold japanese society mildly outspoken commoner perhaps unruly peasant something show people still people anyway nice look show little well day movie like last samurai get long way go reliance common stereotype show lack passion depict people realistic human way
1	All those 10/10's is a joke by imbecils, practicly nothing is a 10 because that's perfect, and this is far from that.5/10 is generous and that mostly because it looks pretty good but not much more.The acting is okay but nothing special, particularly not by most of the main cast, specificly Blackthorne.The story and the characters are a mess, it is nothing like the original story and not in a good way.Important storylines skipped, changed or just messed up badly, characters acting out of character or even new plot lines added, stupid stuff and all of it stinks.I wouldn't recomend this to anyone but i guess it beats being stabbed in the eye.It's an affront to the original story, which was acctually good.	joke imbecil practicly nothing perfect far generous mostly look pretty good much act okay nothing special particularly main cast specificly blackthorne story character mess nothing like original story good way important storyline skip change mess badly character act character even new plot line add stupid stuff stink recomend anyone guess beat stab eye affront original story acctually good

2	As a lover of the Ripley's stories (I have watched Delon's, Malkovich's and Damon's ) I cannot stop loving so far(I am in episode 2) the visual and thematic transformation that Zaillian has made of the Ripley's theme. It's radical to turn the Amalfi coast and Caravaggio into black and white. Also his creation of silence. I believe he wants to turn the characters too. Andrew Scott , always so sweet and likable, as the villain. Scarface Flyn (not sunnyface Jude Law) as Dickey who I am afraid Zaillian is urging us to dislike profoundly, starting with his highly bad taste in art.

1	Overall it was a pretty solid show...until it went woke in season 3. Pushing political points at every turn. Still not a bad show but definitely a poor choice by the writers. After some major events in season 3, they seem to be floundering without much direction for the plot. They need to either get it together or wrap it up.Update: it has gone further downhill and totally lacks direction at this point. Watch seasons 1-2 then call it good. Everything else after is terrible.	overall pretty solid show go wake season push political point every turn still bad show definitely poor choice writer major event season seem flounder without much direction plot need either get together wrap update go downhill totally lack direction point watch season call good everything else terrible
0	It starts with a premise of an older guy joining the LAPD, then beats it to death with ageist jokes that would get the jokesters reprimands from HR. There is no plot each week, just a series of car chases, foot chases, and the insufferable know it all lesson of the week from the lead character, the old rookie played by Fillion, who has left acting for all intents and purposes and taken up playing himself with a range of expressions so limited he reuses the same ones for different emotions. Most of the other characters also have no depth or complexity and are uniformly played as stereotypes. The whole thing is bad and boring.	start premise old guy join lapd beat death ageist joke would get jokester reprimand hr plot week series car chase foot chase insufferable know lesson week lead character old rookie play fillion leave act intent purpose take play range expression limit reuse one different emotion character also depth complexity uniformly play stereotype whole thing bad bore
0	I'll start by pointing out what i like about this show; Good cinematography and acting. The rest is standard directing, mediocre soundtrack and a poor script.I've been in a situation many times, where a dialogue was going on and they spoke of other characters but i didn't seem to know who where they speaking of. I spent the entire first season trying to memorize the names of many of the characters (including some of the main ones). The second season actually made me memorize some of their names. Excluding the main characters the other characters are briefly introduced, nothing outlines them to make you remember which character is who. Do the script writers expect me to read the books before watching this?Worth mentioning that 90% of the show is dialogue, which is OK if it actually leads to something and it's a drama, instead of a fantasy series. Dialogue is mostly irrelevant and boring. It leads nowhere most of the time and does not contribute to the storyline. And in the rare moments it actually does, nothing happens next. You are hang with the promise of everything happening the next season. And to your disappointment, it doesn't. More dialogue and nothing happening. More promises...The story moves slowly. As if they had to stretch the whole thing to make every dollar of the budget count. Daenerys Targaryen could possibly be my favorite character, but she spends, up until now, 4 seasons to build an army and reach the iron throne (which i doubt it will only be in the 5th season, with some luck). That's how slow and boring this is.Whenever an episode finishes, i feel no urge to see the next one. There is nothing that lefts me hanging. I just feel like if they pulled the plug on this one it wouldn't make a difference to me.Mediocre show with dragons and special effects. People digest this crap because they are hungry for a fantasy series with a big budget. A well made Lord of The Rings style series. That's what viewers crave for. And this is the only reason people watch this and feel good about it. This show has no direct competition or it would be dead in the first season.Oh, and some advice. If you do actually watch this; you can take a leak, prepare your popcorn, grab a beer and call your friends to come over, all during the intro.	start point like show good cinematography act rest standard direct mediocre soundtrack poor script situation many time dialogue go speak character seem know speak spend entire first season try memorize name many character include main one second season actually make memorize name exclude main character character briefly introduce nothing outline make remember character script writer expect read book watch worth mention show dialogue ok actually lead something drama instead fantasy series dialogue mostly irrelevant bore lead nowhere time contribute storyline rare moment actually nothing happen next hang promise everything happen next season disappointment dialogue nothing happen promise story move slowly stretch whole thing make every dollar budget count daenery targaryen could possibly favorite character spend season build army reach iron throne doubt th season luck slow bore whenever episode finish feel urge see next one nothing left hang feel like pull plug one make difference mediocre show dragon special effect people digest crap hungry fantasy series big budget well make lord ring style series viewer crave reason people watch feel good show direct competition would dead first season oh advice actually watch take leak prepare popcorn grab beer call friend come intro
2	"I've read the books.I've also seen the Chinese adaptation.And I am intimately familiar with the physics. Which is to say, I know that, strictly speaking, the premise of the story is nonsense. But never mind that. There is a reason why ""fiction"" is part of science-fiction. It's okay for a fictitious universe to have fictitious rules governing its existence, so long as the author stays true to the story's premise. That is why I was able to enjoy the books, suspending my disbelief, and that is why I find this adaptation quite enjoyable as well.Make no mistake about it, the Chinese version was really good quality television, despite it having been, relatively mildly but still obviously, censored in places. But this Netflix version has its own strengths. Shorter (the Chinese adaptation was 30 episodes!) but I do not feel it rushed. I presently just finished watching episode 6, with two more to go. Eager to see the rest.I am, of course, well aware of the dark forest to which this story takes us, so no major surprises there. However, I find that I can relate to, care for the characters: I find them believable, genuine. And although some of the story has been transplanted from China to the West in this adaptation, the essence of the novel stays intact. I understand that the show had mixed reception.All the more, I remain hopeful that nonetheless, season 2 will be greenlit and we can see the rest of the story unfold, including I hope the third book of the trilogy, which had some of the most memorably twists yet."	read book also see chinese adaptation intimately familiar physics say know strictly speak premise story nonsense never mind reason fiction part science fiction okay fictitious universe fictitious rule govern existence long author stay true story premise able enjoy book suspend disbelief find adaptation quite enjoyable well make mistake chinese version really good quality television despite relatively mildly still obviously censor place netflix version strength short chinese adaptation episode feel rush presently finish watch episode two go eager see rest course well aware dark forest story take we major surprise however find relate care character find believable genuine although story transplant china west adaptation essence novel stay intact understand show mix reception remain hopeful nonetheless season greenlit see rest story unfold include hope third book trilogy memorably twist yet
0	Opening of episode one seems promising. Then, the Farrell tries to be stealth in his investigation. Surprise! He is driving a pristine early 60's Corvette convertible that sticks out like any proverbial sore appendage you want. He needs a 3000 Camry. Jump to episode three. WTF was that? Maybe because it was a week between episode 2 and 3, but it was a mass of confusion introducing so many characters where you have no clue what is going on. It appears all characters have some kind of hidden connection, as well as all seem to be playing both sides, while the hero is the only righteous character. My wife and I both had zero idea where this is going, nor care anymore. On a side note, I love Amy Ryan as an actress. She is horrid in this. Terrible acting, and a ridiculous character.	open episode one seem promise farrell try stealth investigation surprise drive pristine early corvette convertible stick like proverbial sore appendage want need camry jump episode three wtf maybe week episode mass confusion introduce many character clue go appear character kind hide connection well seem play side hero righteous character wife zero idea go care anymore side note love amy ryan actress horrid terrible act ridiculous character
1	Unfortunately, I can't way how far the key plot decisions in the series are from the original, though judging from other Netflix adaptations they might be quite far off. Either way, many character decisions and happenings raise questions, are inconsistent and ungrounded - which makes it hard to enjoy at times.That said, it's a good show from many perspectives: it's very well shot and put together, the CGI looks adequate and suitable, great international cast are all doing a great job (though I wish some would have more screen time), and the general premise of the series is appealing: it is, in a nutshell, a believable (yet horrifying) circumstances.I'm not sure I'd suggest it for watching, at least not yet - there's never a guarantee the show will be concluded till it is, and right now in addition to the plot issues it's far from finished.	unfortunately way far key plot decision series original though judge netflix adaptation might quite far either way many character decision happen raise question inconsistent ungrounded make hard enjoy time say good show many perspective well shoot put together cgi look adequate suitable great international cast great job though wish would screen time general premise series appeal nutshell believable yet horrify circumstance sure suggest watch least yet never guarantee show conclude till right addition plot issue far finish

Ive unfortunately been able to see this show multiple times, younger with my mom and numerous times as an adult. Never has a show been so basic with such stale performances and people treat it like its ""The Sopranos"". Its medically inaccurate all the time (even though its the most popular medical show) 20+ seasons of borderline unwatchable tv. Numerous continuity issues throughout the show. The writting is just straight up terrible at times. Its an example of whats wrong with TV. A show with no artistic vision or integrity. Its just constant confict combined with annoying characters all while being one of the most medically inaccurate shows of all time."	grey anatomy poorly write show contant overdramatize event annoy character show build cheap cookie cutter drama act atrocious many level I ve unfortunately able see show multiple time young mom numerous time adult never show basic stale performance people treat like soprano medically inaccurate time even though popular medical show season borderline unwatchable tv numerous continuity issue throughout show writting straight terrible time example what s wrong tv show artistic vision integrity constant confict combine annoy character one medically inaccurate show time
1	I can only give my own personal opinion here, HOWEVER, I think many would agree with what I'm about to say. I used to spend my ENTIRE week waiting for Thursday for 8 whole seasons. I LOVED the characters, the drama, the emotions. I was so into it that my husband would make fun of me. Grey's Anatomy hour meant NO TALKING hour!! I was so in love with the series that to this day I watch older seasons on Netflix once or twice a year! Up to the middle of the 9th season that is....**SPOILERS**We were all sad when they killed Denny, though he wasn't a main character, he would have made a good one, I think we all loved Izzie and Denny. And we were ABSOLUTELY DEVSTATED when George died! Those were okay though, we could got through those and it was great in between and I didn't care even a little bit when Burke left, I never cared for him.BUT THEN.... The plane crash!! What an amazing couple of episodes, until you got to the end of them and realized that up to this point they had killed off 40% of the main cast AND your favorites none the less!! Lexi and Mark!! REALLY!! They were just getting ready to get back together! It was simply too much.Killing off so many main characters didn't do the series any favors, and adding the characters that they did, it RUINED it. Amelia? Ugh she's so annoying, her character has a daddy/big brother complex that she cant seem to get over so she's constantly in a power struggle with men. Its nauseating, I dislike her character very much. Meredith's sister though, I hate her so much I cant even remember her name, she's HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE actress, HORRIBLE, character, HORRIBLE for the show!! Just single handedly dragging the series the bottom. Not to mention killing Jackson & April's baby!! WHAT!! Too much!So my personal opinion of this series is, I'm hooked, I have to see it through, but I recommend not watching after midway through the 9th season, its a waste of time and will likely only annoy. I'm giving it a generous 6. Now it used to be a strong 10 and the only reason it still gets a 6 is because of how amazing it USED to be. If I was going by the last 2.5 seasons alone.... I regret to say it would have only a 2.After last nights 4/23/15 episode I am LIVID!! How could Shonda Rhimes make such a big mistake!! I Guarantee this will be the last season because nobody is going to watch it anymore now that she has killed 97% of the original cast/main characters! Not to mention our favorites!! I'm giving up seeing this one through. Last night was the final episode of Grey's Anatomy that I will ever watch, old or new. What an epic failure. My ALL TIME FAVORITE series went from just that to my most hated one. YOU Don't KILL 97% OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS! Color me disappointed and sad. :( Goodbye Grey's, you were my favorite!	give personal opinion however think many would agree say use spend entire week wait thursday whole season love character drama emotion husband would make fun grey anatomy hour mean talk hour love series day watch old season netflix twice year middle th season spoiler sad kill denny though main character would make good one think love izzie denny absolutely devstate george die okay though could get great care even little bite burke leave never care plane crash amaze couple episode get end realize point kill main cast favorite none less lexi mark really get ready get back together simply much kill many main character series favor add character ruin amelia ugh annoy character daddy big brother complex can not seem get constantly power struggle man nauseate dislike character much meredith sister though hate much can not even remember name horrible horrible actress horrible character horrible show single handedly drag series bottom mention kill jackson april baby much personal opinion series hook see recommend watch midway th season waste time likely annoy give generous use strong reason still get amaze use go last season alone regret say would last night episode livid could shonda rhime make big mistake guarantee last season nobody go watch anymore kill original cast main character mention favorite give see one last night final episode grey anatomy ever watch old new epic failure time favorite series go hat one kill main character color disappoint sad goodbye grey favorite

0	More Netflix mediocrity, who is surprised really at this point ? They'd do anything to push their narrative of big boss woman, even if it makes absolutely no sense. There is absolutely no character development, nothing remotely exciting, tons of inconsistencies. Eliza Gonzalez is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. Her lips are so messed up from injections they barely move when she talks. Her character is annoying and obnoxious. Could barely stand even looking at her. Empty shell of an actress. I had so much hope for this show, really. But Netflix disappoints as usual. This show just shows how Netflix's mediocrity has destroyed the movie industry. Read the book or skip the show.	netflix mediocrity surprise really point anything push narrative big boss woman even make absolutely sense absolutely character development nothing remotely excite ton inconsistency eliza gonzalez one bad actor ever see lip mess injection barely move talk character annoy obnoxious could barely stand even look empty shell actress much hope show really netflix disappoint usual show show netflix mediocrity destroy movie industry read book skip show
0	The thing here is that if you've watched the original Chinese adaption of the book Three body then you will be left wanting by this version.It's much quicker paced but at the cost of so many details that are really supposed to be in there to make it truly good.Sadly 95% of the people will never know what they are missing and I guess for them this might still seem like a good show. I can only imagine what they would have thought about it if they knew better.If the reviewers could compare it to the Chinese version like me, this one would not currently have the same rating as the original. Because it simply does not deserve a similar rating.It gets the message across but it hurts to see it done in such a rudimentary way.	thing watch original chinese adaption book three body leave want version much quick pace cost many detail really suppose make truly good sadly people never know miss guess might still seem like good show imagine would think know well reviewer could compare chinese version like one would currently rat original simply deserve similar rat get message across hurt see do rudimentary way
2	Baby Reindeer is dark and gritty from the start. Jessica Gunning takes the role of the stalker to truly sinister levels and plays the part superbly well. The story is compelling and the less you know about it the better. You'll wonder how this is all real, but the events that occur probably wouldn't occur the same way in fiction. But life isn't fiction and that is what makes this series so powerful.Richard Gadd plays the lead role after living these events in his life. It is brave of him to have written and to star in his own true story, particularly a story with such horror and heartache.It's a riveting watch!8/10.	baby reindeer dark gritty start jessica gun take role stalker truly sinister level play part superbly well story compel less know well wonder real event occur probably occur way fiction life fiction make series powerful richard gadd play lead role live event life brave write star true story particularly story horror heartache rivet watch
1	I've been watching Grey's Anatomy since season 1. Safe to say I am a fan. For anyone who is new to the series, the first few seasons are great, naturally over the years, it's lost a bit of steam but still very watchable. However, come 2021 and I am so disappointed like never before.The show has become very political- racism, inequality and COVID are the main themes. In as much as I am all for this...... BUT not when I just want to be entertained and watch a tv show to escape/switch off from the realities of life.There were a few episodes this season that were not necessarily political but fell flat and boring which I put down to the issue of COVID and maybe the writers unable to use what they had initially planned for the season.Honestly, they would have been better off skipping this year if this is what they were going to produce. Just not entertaining and fun anymore. It's become quite bleak really.I've noticed this is not the only show that has gone down this route, few others have as well. I personally find it very frustrating. Yes let's bring about change but can we do so on a different platform.	watch grey anatomy since season safe say fan anyone new series first season great naturally year lose bite steam still watchable however come disappoint like never show become political racism inequality covid main theme much want entertain watch tv show escape switch reality life episode season necessarily political fall flat bore put issue covid maybe writer unable use initially plan season honestly would well skip year go produce entertain fun anymore become quite bleak really notice show go route other well personally find frustrate yes let bring change different platform

In the morning, put on some respectable clothes! You know, the kind that George Clooney wears when he goes out to dinner. Go to the studio and pretend that you fit into society! Meaning, rather than trying to force society to conform to you, why not do a little conforming yourself! Do that for four episodes (before you drive everyone away) and see if the reviews get better or worse!

0	Rookie was one of my favourite shows. I loved how it was well written and light-hearted. It focussed on the characters within the series and how they developed and cops and how they handled the odd situations they came across.Season 3 however is a disaster. Every story, every sentence, has an agenda. It is heavily biased and it detracts from the well loved characters and their personalities. The agenda isn't even factual. For example :a black woman is pulled over for running a red light. She is found to have a stash of guns in the car. She claims they belong to her ex and gives a sob story about how she was confiscating them and delivering them to the police station. She admits stealing her husbands property and breaking into his house with a key to do so. She gets arrested by the evil white guy cop while Jackson looks on in anger. He claims she should have never been arrested. So the writers here want the police to believe every story they are told without question and want the police to ignore obvious felonies ! Instead they want them to have sympathy !-another one, Lucy berates Tim for being too harsh on a group of Latino gardeners that they pulled over when she had first started patrolling with him. She claims he was to harsh on them and that he should have considered how hey felt even though they had several violations against them. So again the writers want the police to consider the feelings of criminals and potential criminals. The writers actually want the police to stop and think about this before they make a move ! Have the writers ever actually been involved with real police work ?I wouldn't mind if the subject was touched upon, or they made series 3 involve a long running incident about a single act of police brutality. For example i think it would have been good if they had a felon die in their custody suite, then involve the fall out in subsequent episodes - for example show how the rookies deal with a riot against their station etc. But no - instead it is lots of heavily one sided sub plots that do nothing more than show the ignorance of the writers and their determination to tick boxes !It just detracts from what was a good show and it is a shame.	rookie one favourite show love well write light hearted focus character within series develop cop handle odd situation come across season however disaster every story every sentence agenda heavily bias detract well love character personality agenda even factual example black woman pull run red light find stash gun car claim belong ex give sob story confiscate deliver police station admit steal husband property break house key get arrest evil white guy cop jackson look anger claim never arrest writer want police believe every story tell without question want police ignore obvious felony instead want sympathy another one lucy berate tim harsh group latino gardener pull first start patrol claim harsh consider hey feel even though several violation writer want police consider feel criminal potential criminal writer actually want police stop think make move writer ever actually involve real police work mind subject touch upon make series involve long run incident single act police brutality example think would good felon die custody suite involve fall subsequent episode example show rookie deal riot station etc instead lot heavily one side sub plot nothing show ignorance writer determination tick box detract good show shame
1	The critique is not to do with the final fates of character. Instead it's with the overall production of the final season. It's as if they changed directors, editors, and writers. Season 8 had novice filming mistakes, timing and overall all flown issues. It was a gravely disappointing end product. We're all left to day dream how we'd have done it differently. Now if George R. R. Martin would ever get to finishing the written series, we might get a consistent to the text, quality ending. Please finish. Mr. Martin.

1	It is a fact that the writing has gone downhill in this show. It is a fact that the last couple of episodes and/or seasons were rushed and under-developed. It is a fact that the character development was thrown out of the window. It is a fact that D&D are solid adapters, but very lousy writers (fellowship of the wight storyline must be the stupidest thing I've ever seen on TV).It is also a fact that the casting was just perfect - as a book reader, I couldn't have wished for better actors; not just their resemblance and accuracy, but (most of) their acting was superb. It is also a fact that visuals are stunning - the locations were brilliantly selected, sets were magnificently built, costumes were beautifully chosen, special effects are amongst the best on TV at the moment (probably the best). It is also a fact that the score is otherworldly, I honestly don't have words to describe how perfect all of it is (kudos to Ramin Djawadi). It is also a fact that all of the directors did an amazing job, considering all the different dimensions and sets this show has (grand battles, silent dinners, feasts, war meetings, conquers, casual conversations...).It is not THE best show ever. It is not a perfect show. But it certainly broke ground, it certainly set the standard high for the next great epic TV show and it certainly was (and will remain) a global phenomenon that should be remembered for all of its qualities.	fact write go downhill show fact last couple episode season rush develop fact character development throw window fact solid adapter lousy writer fellowship wight storyline must stupid thing ever see tv also fact cast perfect book reader wish well actor resemblance accuracy act superb also fact visual stun location brilliantly select set magnificently build costume beautifully choose special effect amongst good tv moment probably well also fact score otherworldly honestly word describe perfect kudos ramin djawadi also fact director amaze job consider different dimension set show grand battle silent dinner feast war meet conquer casual conversation well show ever perfect show certainly break grind certainly set standard high next great epic tv show certainly remain global phenomenon remember quality
2	"But still a show worth the watch and overall well done.Some characters got obnoxiously stale with the same stick up their rumps the entire season with seemingly no development or change, which you can never know on this side of the screen if it was the actors choice or the directors. Nonetheless, there were numerous brilliant and full performances from many that far out weighed the limited performances of one or two, making for a well rounded group of characters.The writing was overall good, but ironically left some pretty novice holes for someone pretentiously referring to C. S. Lewis as a terrible writer simply due to the writers nonsubtly repeated bias towards theasim.Some parts were hilariously poor planned with a good number of plot holes any half sober viewer would point out: ""Wasn't the whole point of this plan to avoid mass destruction to a ship, unlike shootin the damn thing with a missile? Well the whole thing is a flaming pile of rubble now, I guess you sure got lucky you missed slicing up the thing you didn't even know what was, and more lucky you found it""""Heli's and swat canvassing the whole area and no one sees the broad shot through the calf crawling like a snail wide out in the open?""""Same broad who seems to be their only means of assassinating anyone at any needed time across the globe, lives in a generic, unsecured, vulnerable trailer without means of immediate transportation? Why would they not set her up with a batcave of sorts.""""Fifteen plus years the judgement day cruisers have been talking to these things, they've already read half a book on fairy-tales, they've been monitoring all our activity globally, they ask more questions than a three year old, and they're JUST NOW stumbling across the concept of a lie?""I could go on and on about little overlooked lazy plot holes in the writing, and wouldn't even mention them if the writers hadn't been so obviously and obnoxiously egotistical about their own abilities and intellect. But if you're going to jab historically renowned writers of the past, you had better be at least on par with your peers of the present.They are not.But, they did adapt an engaging story from someone else's work that seems to be written well (only guessing from the compelling main plot that I assume was copy pasted from the source material).So I'm still thankful it was made.I think this is worth the watch and am looking forward to future seasons. Not looking forward to waiting. Boo hoo first world problems.But I'd really appreciate seeing the conclusion of this series before the whole world blows itself up in world War three, and I really can't be so sure anymore (he says half sarcastically through gritted teeth).So please show runners, do make haste."	still show worth watch overall well do character get obnoxiously stale stick rump entire season seemingly development change never know side screen actor choice director nonetheless numerous brilliant full performance many far weigh limit performance one two make well round group character write overall good ironically leave pretty novice hole someone pretentiously refer c lewis terrible writer simply due writer nonsubtly repeat bias towards theasim part hilariously poor plan good number plot hole half sober viewer would point whole point plan avoid mass destruction ship unlike shootin damn thing missile well whole thing flame pile rubble guess sure get lucky miss slice thing even know lucky find heli swat canvass whole area one see broad shoot calf crawl like snail wide open broad seem mean assassinate anyone need time across globe live generic unsecured vulnerable trailer without mean immediate transportation would set batcave sort fifteen plus year judgement day cruiser talk thing already read half book fairy tale monitor activity globally ask question three year old stumble across concept lie could go little overlook lazy plot hole write even mention writer obviously obnoxiously egotistical ability intellect go jab historically renowned writer past well least par peer present adapt engage story someone else work seem write well guess compel main plot assume copy paste source material still thankful make think worth watch look forward future season look forward wait boo hoo first world problem really appreciate see conclusion series whole world blow world war three really sure anymore say half sarcastically grit tooth please show runner make haste
1	"I'm struggling through the series, and I haven't even finished episode 3. Had to watch Plein Soleil with Alain Delon to remind myself why I'm so fascinated by the book and character so much.I usually have no problem with black & white, but shooting in Italy, all those gorgeous locations, it's just a dumb choice.Anthony Minghella's version, in my opinion, is the best. Jude Law is the perfect characterization of Greenleaf. And I haven't seen any actor play Freddy better than Philip Seymour Hoffman.But what to say about the casting of this miniseries? Andrew Scott is a great actor and I loved him as the hot priest in Fleabag (but where did all that sexy vibe go? You won't find it in this series, that's for sure). The guy who plays Greenleaf wouldn't be able to seduce anyone. There's no chemistry between him and Marge, or, more relevantly, him and Ripley. His character is irrelevant. I wouldn't mind if he got murdered in the first episode.And, although Dakota is an actor I respect, she's just miscast and flat. Gwyneth Paltrow did a better job. Minghella knew he had to have a ""Grace Kelly"" Marge. And she did that perfectly.Matt Damon is a terrific actor, though I'm not sure he was well suited for the part. But it was interesting. While Delon was too handsome for the part, Damon, preferred to play it more awkwardly. I thought it was a bright choice.I've read lots of comments regarding the age of the actors.

1	"Let me start off with one thing. The ""science"" part is absolute nonsense. In each and every aspect throughout the flick. The fiction part is kind of bearable, although there's so much garbage in it, it's laughable at times. Like multidimensional aliens traveling at 1% of speed of light, but instantly sending modded photons to Earth and operating with data, measured in bytes. And as that is not hilarious enough, let's do our currently popular earthling thing and mock up conspiracies, do some virtue signaling, but bring cryonics as plausible scientific method. Well, I'll be damned.Won't even open up on the nixie tube countdown ""effect"", that takes 60% of one's vision as it's ridiculous. Both visually and as a concept. Also ridiculous is the digital noise used to symbolize alien communication. And the cherry on top - the VR thing. Jesus! Who even needed this in the plot in the first place? Consumer VR's been physically around for 30+ years now; the concept for few more decades. Did we just find it's few centuries futuristic?And there's an elephant in the room I need to address. Why was Clarence's son even featured as a character if his only purpose was to tell the viewer something no one cares about. That, he, literally another random halfbrained lazy unemployed brat, is also mohoxesual. Like yeah, okay mate, whatever, doesn't make you any less useless on global scale innit? Probably they should start with your spoiled generation, for all I care.And yet, weirdly enough, it didn't annoy me as much as I expected another lousy book adaptation would do. Still, there's this hanging question. Why did not they just blow entire population's heads remotely via them sophons, instead of going through all the hassle? Would have had a clean and perfectly eco-friendly planet to enjoy upon arrival."	let start one thing science part absolute nonsense every aspect throughout flick fiction part kind bearable although much garbage laughable time like multidimensional alien travel speed light instantly send modded photon earth operate datum measure byte hilarious enough let currently popular earthle thing mock conspiracy virtue signal bring cryonic plausible scientific method well damn even open nixie tube countdown effect take one vision ridiculous visually concept also ridiculous digital noise use symbolize alien communication cherry top vr thing jesus even need plot first place consumer vr physically around year concept decade find century futuristic elephant room need address clarence son even feature character purpose tell viewer something one care literally another random halfbraine lazy unemployed brat also mohoxesual like yeah okay mate whatever make less useless global scale innit probably start spoil generation care yet weirdly enough annoy much expect another lousy book adaptation would still hang question blow entire population head remotely via sophon instead go hassle would clean perfectly eco friendly planet enjoy upon arrival

Watching this show, starts very interesting, discovering whats happening, slow paced, mysterious, good plot..up until 5th episode.Then it turns into a disappointment from David and David, once again. I dont know if these dudes have a limited potion of creativity for their shows, where if they use much in the beginning there is none left for the ending.Starting from the ship scene, where the military discussion is what is the best and quickest way to get the harddrive, without casualties and without putting the drive in danger of being destroyed... Yet they choose the most dangerous method of slicing everything and the ship burns.. But they do find the drive undamaged ofc.Aliens who are so advanced to travel in spaceships with 1% speed of light, and sophons to change our reality, actually cant find a closer place to live and terraform (i dont even know if they breathe oxygen, as they say they dont look like humans at all and are multidimensional beings) but they just decide to come and destroy humans and live on earth... Ofc.Building a capsule with a parachute that opens into space(in vacuum)..precisely following a route where atom bombs are set that explode right between the parachute and the capsule... I'm amazed how they managed tonput those atom bombs so quickly, what materials were used to protect the chute and the capsule (with a half-frozen human inside) that protects from atomic blast and radiation... Ofc.Im not even going to mention how amazing is that five friends from school have the luck to be the inventor of nanotechnology polymer, a physicist who solves the game and the space problem, the guy who in his mind will find the solution and the guy who is dying so is the perfect candidate to travel frozen to the aliens(and still don't get why)..I'm totally going to not laugh at the poor attempts to create a drama of love interests and pointless conflicts, same as the attempt to create guilt to anyone not working for the ""human"" side... Same side that in reality destroys it self and this planet every day, but even a common alien enemy cannot bring together.I think the biggest slap in the face will be from Netflix when they cancel this show in the middle, as they do.."	read book see chinese series watch show start interest discover what s happen slow pace mysterious good plot th episode turn disappointment david david do not know dude limit potion creativity show use much begin none leave end start ship scene military discussion well quick way get harddrive without casualty without put drive danger destroy yet choose dangerous method slice everything ship burn find drive undamaged ofc alien advance travel spaceship speed light sophon change reality actually can not find close place live terraform do not even know breathe oxygen say do not look like human multidimensional be decide come destroy human live earth ofc build capsule parachute open space vacuum precisely follow route atom bomb set explode right parachute capsule amaze manage tonput atom bomb quickly material use protect chute capsule half freeze human inside protect atomic blast radiation ofc I m even go mention amaze five friend school luck inventor nanotechnology polymer physicist solve game space problem guy mind find solution guy die perfect candidate travel freeze alien still get totally go laugh poor attempt create drama love interest pointless conflict attempt create guilt anyone work human side side reality destroy self planet every day even common alien enemy bring together think big slap face netflix cancel show middle

Also from the science fiction perspective sophon thing is not that much feasible. Giving all the keys of world to 3 wallfacers oh! From the scientific base of books built There is a good point of view, however when you combined all the science with the development of characters and fiction of scriptwriter. Its starting to lose meaning. Development of characters in the books might be much more detailed or the same comment is valid for the fictional development of the story. However in the end we are watching the story written by script writers who interted lots of political manipulation into story like Leyla Aric kurdish terorist organization member given as a war hero.	book wallfacer show guess one member terorist ognization ypg back we syria also science fiction perspective sophon thing much feasible give key world wallfacer oh scientific base book build good point view however combine science development character fiction scriptwriter start lose mean development character book might much detail comment valid fictional development story however end watch story write script writer interte lot political manipulation story like leyla aric kurdish terorist organization member give war hero
1	I am still hooked on Alain Delon's diabolic charmingness. He had all the ingredients required for the character. The Plein Soleil captures the essence of Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel. The 1999 film needed more artistry. Matt Damon was the worst of Mr. Ripley, and the movie was the worst of the remakes. However, I like the new remake on Netflix with Andrew Scott and Johnny Flynn. They are too old for the characters, and Dakota Fanning performs flatly. Amazingly, Highsmisth's psychological thriller has endured for more than 70 years as one of the best psychological thrillers adapted to movies.	still hook alain delon diabolic charmingness ingredient require character plein soleil capture essence patricia highsmith novel film need artistry matt damon bad mr ripley movie bad remake however like new remake netflix andrew scott johnny flynn old character dakota fan perform flatly amazingly highsmisth psychological thriller endure year one good psychological thriller adapt movie
0	One could argue that just because the last season is completely abysmal, that shouldn't detract from early seasons. However, when so much of the show is build-up for the finale - storylines you have to wade through for seasons in the hope+expectation they're going somewhere - then the final season's awfulness really does detract from the entire product.As an example - the whole white walker build-up and related Bran Stark storyline just basically comes to nothing. We never even really learn what it was all about, and it just ends so abruptly. Similarly Danaerys' whole storyline just ends so nonsensically after all the time spent following her. Jaime Lannister's whole arc ends in a nonsensical mess. Etc etc.A show whose core strength was its story+characters - a show which could shock viewers, but always in ways which in the early seasons entirely made sense given the characters' character - devolving into such a nonsensical mess. The last season is a pure cash grab made by talentless people with no interest anymore in working to deliver a half-decent ending to what they'd spent seasons building up. I just hope George R. R. Martin actually finishes the last books and manages to give the story a more satisfying ending which shows-up how pathetic in comparison Hollywood's attempt to write its own ending was (and yes, of course he is somewhat to blame for not finishing the books before the TV show reached the end).	one could argue last season completely abysmal detract early season however much show build finale storyline wade season hope expectation go somewhere final season awfulness really detract entire product example whole white walker build relate bran stark storyline basically come nothing never even really learn end abruptly similarly danaery whole storyline end nonsensically time spend follow jaime lannister whole arc end nonsensical mess etc etc show whose core strength story character show could shock viewer always way early season entirely make sense give character character devolve nonsensical mess last season pure cash grab make talentless people interest anymore work deliver half decent end spend season build hope george r r martin actually finish last book manage give story satisfy end show pathetic comparison hollywood attempt write end yes course somewhat blame finish book tv show reach end

A man gets stabbed in the guts twice wit a dagger that goes in till the hilt and then walks a mile or so and is still heathy enough to speak a dialogue?? Cynical and ironical Tyrion turns into a weeping dweep?? A dragon - well I don't know about dragons - but spouting fire endlessly?? Destroying a city when you only have to take apart the main building to get your enemy?? And so on and so on.. Stay off the booze boys an stick to writing commercials!!	finish season advice writer scenarist stay coke drink much perhaps improve work never see abominable scenario man get stab gut twice wit dagger go till hilt walk mile still heathy enough speak dialogue cynical ironical tyrion turn weep dweep dragon well know dragon spout fire endlessly destroy city take apart main build get enemy stay booze boy stick write commercial

The death count down was a great setting in the novel.leading the characters to find out what trouble they are in and show how scientists use their wisdom and strength to break mist. But in this show it showed up in a bloody suicide scene? Like it's a Strange horror gimmick. And what is going on with the 🍻 pub scene? A shallow man try to hook up with two girls and they show how intelligent and independent they are by saying their identity are replacement and plot tool the writer creat to fill the plot hole he dig during his adaptation?At the end let's talk about it's political correctness problem. To me it's more unbearable than the little mermaid(Live action version). Under the adaptation that basically destroyed everything in the novel for diversification. The creators showed no respect to Chinese. Where the novel's writer is from.	show name body problem give fancy cg music suspension story find respect original novel death count great set novel lead character find trouble show scientist use wisdom strength break mist show show bloody suicide scene like strange horror gimmick go pub scene shallow man try hook two girl show intelligent independent say identity replacement plot tool writer creat fill plot hole dig adaptation end let talk political correctness problem unbearable little mermaid live action version adaptation basically destroy everything novel diversification creator show respect chinese novel writer
2	Sugar is a new LA noir private detective show that works both as a hommage to the genre and a self serious meta parody with all the cliches imaginable. After 2 episodes it's difficult to tell where it will go but I like it for the moment.Colin Farrell is great as usual and succeeds in giving gravitas to a character that for the moment is paper thin. We feel he has a past and relationships and traumas and an inner life.I reserve the right to revise my note according to the evolution of the next episodes. Many shows started great and collapsed very fast (the Apple TV+ Godzilla show for example). Let's wait and see.	sugar new la noir private detective show work hommage genre self serious meta parody cliche imaginable episode difficult tell go like moment colin farrell great usual succeed give gravita character moment paper thin feel past relationship traumas inner life reserve right revise note accord evolution next episode many show start great collapse fast apple tv godzilla show example let wait see
0	"This could be a very good show, if not for the fact that most of the characters can not complete a full sentence without pausing, stuttering, stammering, winding off topic, then finally finishing the thought and then repeating it, sometimes more than once. Also, virtually every character, including guest stars react the same way when faced with a devastating situation. In the episode ""Freedom: Part 1, a young couple are both being treated for cancer. When the young man dies, his girlfriend reacts by repeatedly crying out, ""Don't say anything to me. Don't say anything to me."" When Callie built legs for a patient who died, she kept yelling, ""I made his legs, I made his legs, I made his legs!"" These are only two examples of many. Shonda Rhimes must think that all people have the same reaction to grief/heartbreak/devastation because it is the response she uses so often. I find most of the characters to be self-absorbed, hypocritical, and egotistical. This is especially true of Meredith who I perceive as completely narcissistic, unbearably whiny, and her ""cute"" stammering, nervousness is incredibly annoying."	could good show fact character complete full sentence without pause stutter stammer wind topic finally finish think repeat sometimes also virtually every character include guest star react way face devastate situation episode freedom part young couple treat cancer young man die girlfriend react repeatedly cry say anything say anything callie build leg patient die keep yell make leg make leg make leg two example many shonda rhime must think people reaction grief heartbreak devastation response use often find character self absorb hypocritical egotistical especially true meredith perceive completely narcissistic unbearably whiny cute stammer nervousness incredibly annoy
1	Interesting but Over Indulgent, Over Padded and Over CookedOscar winning director/writer Steven Zaillian gives us another incarnation of the fascinating Tom Ripley character most famously portrayed by Matt Damon in 1999's The Talented Mr. Ripley but also seen in several other films. This version though is all the 1999 version as Ripley (Andrew Scott) goes to Italy to buddy up to Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) and assume his identity. Ripley's sudden involvement irks Greenleaf's girlfriend Marge (Dakota Fanning) and friend Freddie (Eliot Sumner) who have their doubts.The 1999 version was close to perfection as a taut, tantalizing thriller with excellent performances across the board. This version is slick, scrumptious to look at and has a visually arresting, stylish aesthetic. Having the story shown in black and white is initially distracting in early episodes as it feels pretentious but is used to interesting visual effect. Shades of Hitchcock is very evident. Beautiful cinematography, lush technical qualities, excellent music score make this a polished production.The story wobbles though. Like a lot of streaming programs today, this doesn't justify 8-episodes. A lot of it is padding, long drawn-out scenes of characters doing absolutely nothing. Weird because it omits a lot from the story (which we get to later). There's episodes where the lead is just wandering around looking into nothing.The story is also a bit of a mess. All for artistic freedom and creativity but it deviates a lot from the original story but doesn't really add anything in. The Dickie character is killed off very early and there's a few episodes just of Ripley doing nothing much. The Freddie character comes in one episode, disappears completely until they are back for their murder scene but by then we've had just one scene of the character so we're not invested in anything about this person. The disposing of Freddie's body takes a LONG time (a good 30 minutes) of Ripley driving around Italy to dispose a body. Again the padding is extraordinary. The Marge character disappears throughout and there is a lack of chemistry between her and Dickie only because they barely have any screen time together. Curious to why the 8-hours is focused on long, extensively drawn out scenes of the lead just walking by himself around Italy. A few characters from the original are also omitted presumedly to let us see more of Scott walking around Italy as if he is a man on some mission.The cast are fine but struggle to match the committed performances of the film. Dakota Fanning fares best by injecting a compassionate yet suspicious girlfriend. Johnny Flynn is OK but its hard to like him - a flaw which Jude Law combatted so perfectly in his award-nominated take. The Dickie character is just boring and not fun at all. Eliot Sumner's variation of Freddie is odd to say the least. Andrew Scott as the titular character is practically in every scene - 8 hours' worth of Scott really. There's a commitment to his performance for sure but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Damon's variation had depth - Scott's version is wooden, stiff and confusing. He walks around empty like some cyborg. Even the scenes he is supposed to be ravishing with intensity - he is monotone.By episode 6, I was getting pretty tired of watching Scott walking around the dead of night through Italy, up and down stairs, across the street, staring into a window...Not a total skip, but it's definitely a fast forward program to get through. There's about 3 hours of wasted time on indulgence.Beautiful to look at, empty in its core.	interest indulgent pad cookedoscar win director writer steven zaillian give we another incarnation fascinate tom ripley character famously portray matt damon talente mr ripley also see several film version though version ripley andrew scott go italy buddy dickie greenleaf johnny flynn assume identity ripley sudden involvement irk greenleaf girlfriend marge dakota fan friend freddie eliot sumner doubt version close perfection taut tantalize thriller excellent performance across board version slick scrumptious look visually arrest stylish aesthetic story show black white initially distract early episode feel pretentious use interest visual effect shade hitchcock evident beautiful cinematography lush technical quality excellent music score make polish production story wobble though like lot stream program today justify episode lot pad long draw scene character absolutely nothing weird omit lot story get late episode lead wander around look nothing story also bite mess artistic freedom creativity deviate lot original story really add anything dickie character kill early episode ripley nothing much freddie character come one episode disappear completely back murder scene one scene character invest anything person dispose freddie body take long time good minute ripley drive around italy dispose body pad extraordinary marge character disappear throughout lack chemistry dickie barely screen time together curious hour focus long extensively draw scene lead walk around italy character original also omit presumedly let we see scott walk around italy man mission cast fine struggle match commit performance film dakota fan fare good inject compassionate yet suspicious girlfriend johnny flynn ok hard like flaw jude law combat perfectly award nominate take dickie character bore fun eliot sumner variation freddie odd say least andrew scott titular character practically every scene hour worth scott really commitment performance sure quite hit mark damon variation depth scott version wooden stiff confuse walk around empty like cyborg even scene suppose ravish intensity monotone episode get pretty tire watch scott walk around dead night italy stair across street star window total skip definitely fast forward program get hour waste time indulgence beautiful look empty core

The only saving grace cast-wise at all is Wong and Cunningham.Beauty queen world-leading nano-tech researchers? C'mon. Is there really a rich snack-mogul in the books?

And the rich guy certainly moved in circles where his picture would have been taken and appeared in mags or newspapers.And how could the inspector not recognize that Ripley was the same guy he interviewed as Richard. What with his voice not disguised and his mannerisms in plain view.Some pretty scenery, and nice photography, and a great performance by an observant cat, but poor casting (ages, lack of charisma) doom this effort.	whole thing spin around people realize ripley take richard identity point way end would someone want see one look like especially since want find rich guy certainly move circle picture would take appear mag newspaper could inspector recognize ripley guy interview richard voice disguise mannerism plain view pretty scenery nice photography great performance observant cat poor cast age lack charisma doom effort

0	I love science fiction and I was excited about this series after the first episode (I didn't read the books that it is based on). The premise seemed exciting and the story felt like it was going to be smart. However, from the third episode on, it felt like the producers were just filling time and had to meet their contractual obligations to deliver the streaming service an eight episode show whether the story required it or not. For example of the fluff, there is a scene where one of the characters takes a bath...we get to see her get into the tub and we watch her think and think about her angst for a really longtime...it's already been pounded into out heads a dozen times that she has angst...unnecessary streaming series fluff! Most of the episodes seem like filler...too much time is spent on relationship angst and unrequited love. This story would have worked better as a medium length movie rather than this dragged out 8-episode borefest.	love science fiction excite series first episode read book base premise seem excite story feel like go smart however third episode feel like producer fill time meet contractual obligation deliver stream service eight episode show whether story require example fluff scene one character take bath get see get tub watch think think angst really longtime already pound head dozen time angst unnecessary stream series fluff episode seem like filler much time spend relationship angst unrequited love story would work well medium length movie rather drag episode borefest

There seemed to be a concerted effort to bolster the female characters' importance to every situation at the expense of their significant others.Anyway, this latest episode, featuring Dim and Juicy, means 'lights out' as far as I'm concerned.

2	"I enjoyed the show a lot as a fan of game series, but the plot has incredible inconsistencies, not related to games, just bad setups, that I doubt will hold up on second viewing.I still consider the show massive success and can't wait for second season, but I hope following issues won't repeat in following season.The show has major issue with writing. Most of the major conflicts/situations are setup in a completely nonsensical way just to create drama, when upon resolving it you find the whole setup does not make sense at all in regards to characters motivations. Ie initial setup makes sense upon first viewing, not knowing all information, but once you understand who the characters are and their motivations, the initial setup makes absolutely no sense and is not something that the characters would ever do. Writers essentially need to create drama and violence in this show, while also having characters who sometimes turn out good. But the writing is somewhat poor, so the way they do it is to render the characters bad/evil and then resolve it as ""hey, we are the good guys actually"", which falls apart, because the whole initial conflict could be resolved with 5 minute talk, which they can't have, because then none of it would make any sense.Spoilers:1) Right at start, the whole setup with raiders coming in and brutalizing everyone makes absolutely no sense upon finishing the season. Moldaver as the villain was clearly not a villain and while as everyone in wasteland is perfectly fine with violence that whole massacre makes zero sense. Why did she not say what the overseer did? Did she not know everyone else in the vault is clearly innocent? Before massacring everyone they could have, you know, talk or hold them captives and get only the overseer for the code they needed. But no, the show needed to create villain and get some violence in, so at start they created characters that were brutal and barbaric, which then absolutely does not hold up. That was not justified violence to have a revenge after Shady Sands, that was just plain massacre to give motivation to Lucy and have over the top violence at start. Moldaver was clearly extremely smart character as we find out during the season, yet at start her actions are irrationally brutal and she has zero ability to communicate to the people she is about to massacre, why? I will tell you why, because show runners wanted to create evil mysterious character, who we will slowly find out she actually is and has supposed ""depth"". But that does not work when that character actually behaves like a brutal idiot who can't tell innocent people that the guy who was their leader literally nuked the surface. But later on we are supposed to buy she is reasonable person who has altruistic motives in heart. If the story and characters acted reasonably and not like idiots, there was no reveal at the end, whole vault would be told what happened right at the start. Ie its fake drama, that is not believable, because characters don't act in a believable way true to who they are supposed to be.2) At one of the early episodes we see Goggins fight T-60 operated by Maximus who does not even have a training and it's a pretty long fight where Goggins struggles. Ie its early on and T-60 has to still be established as a super weapon. Then magically at last episode Goggins remembers T-60 have build flaw and can be essentially taken down by one shot ( sure, literal walking tank have armor flaw on the chest armor, whatever, I am not going to even talk about that ). Anyways, writers dot this, because they failed to create any better resolution to the whole fight at the end, so they bring Goggins in with his magic bullet trick to take down army of T-60s, because now he remembered he can do that. I am sorry, but that's just awful and made the whole resolution of the final fight a complete joke to me.3) The whole section with Vault with mutated inhabitants who were actually nice was equally stupid. Again, it was mostly fun, but the entire premise is stupid. They could literally tell them at begging, ""hey some of us were experimented on way back and that's why we have these mutations. Don't go to level 12 please, there is some stuff from that time. ""But again, writers needed to create drama, so while the characters are actually nice, they make them act whole time shady and suspicious, so that the main character thinks there is something wrong and audience thinks something is wrong as well. But there is not, it's just writers gaslighting audience with actions that make no sense for the actually nice characters. As in point 1, whole situation would be resolved in a roughly 2 minute chat, but they are not allowed to do that, because none of the motivations and actions of those characters would hold up. The whole gaslighting of main characters and audience to think they bring in people just to experiment on them was just gaslighting. There is actual reason why they did have the mutations, which they could easily explain to them. They do anyway in the end!!! But that would make too much sense early on and then we don't have episode. Perhaps having characters who can behave consistently at start of the episode and it's end would be better.Anyways, I realy like the show, there were many good things about it mentioned by others in it to compensate all the inconsistencies, but I hope the next season can do without these."	enjoy show lot fan game series plot incredible inconsistency relate game bad setup doubt hold second view still consider show massive success wait second season hope follow issue repeat follow season show major issue write major conflict situation setup completely nonsensical way create drama upon resolve find whole setup make sense regard character motivation ie initial setup make sense upon first view know information understand character motivation initial setup make absolutely sense something character would ever writer essentially need create drama violence show also character sometimes turn good write somewhat poor way render character bad evil resolve hey good guy actually fall apart whole initial conflict could resolve minute talk none would make sense spoiler right start whole setup raider come brutalize everyone make absolutely sense upon finish season moldaver villain clearly villain everyone wasteland perfectly fine violence whole massacre make zero sense say overseer know everyone else vault clearly innocent massacre everyone could know talk hold captive get overseer code need show need create villain get violence start create character brutal barbaric absolutely hold justify violence revenge shady sand plain massacre give motivation lucy top violence start moldaver clearly extremely smart character find season yet start action irrationally brutal zero ability communicate people massacre tell show runner want create evil mysterious character slowly find actually suppose depth work character actually behave like brutal idiot tell innocent people guy leader literally nuke surface later suppose buy reasonable person altruistic motive heart story character act reasonably like idiot reveal end whole vault would tell happen right start ie fake drama believable character act believable way true suppose one early episode see goggin fight operate maximus even train pretty long fight goggin struggle ie early still establish super weapon magically last episode goggin remember build flaw essentially take one shoot sure literal walk tank armor flaw chest armor whatever go even talk anyways writer dot fail create well resolution whole fight end bring goggin magic bullet trick take army remember sorry awful make whole resolution final fight complete joke whole section vault mutate inhabitant actually nice equally stupid mostly fun entire premise stupid could literally tell beg hey us experiment way back mutation go level please stuff time writer need create drama character actually nice make act whole time shady suspicious main character think something wrong audience think something wrong well writer gaslighte audience action make sense actually nice character point whole situation would resolve roughly minute chat allow none motivation action character would hold whole gaslighte main character audience think bring people experiment gaslighte actual reason mutation could easily explain anyway end would make much sense early episode perhaps character behave consistently start episode end would well anyways realy like show many good thing mention other compensate inconsistency hope next season without
2	"I never written a review but had to for this show since I would be considered an ""OG"" of the Game series . I've been waiting years and years for a show and we finally got one . I'm stoked for season 2 seeing new Vegas gave me a rush . What can we expect to see . The House ? The boomers ? Caesars legion ? Great khans ? The kings ? Id like to see the institute or Railroad eventually but thats whats great about this series . The possibilities are endless . The FO series is set up with tide turning action and drama situations but also has great corky weird scenarios and characters to give it that missing ingredient of dark humor and Comedy in general . Love how you are all bringing the wasteland to life .i love how they follow a few different characters. Continue to raise the bar and drop jaws .

2	The first book is hard to make in to a series but I think the first 8 episodes was pretty good. This series goes bananas in the second book so I really hope we get a second season.Lots of changes in this adaptation but It makes more sense for a western version.Great job with cgi and casting. The story is kind of slow but it grows into a terrifying nightmare. And ends a bit early. I would have like too see the time jump of the second book in the end.I guess they could have told about the Dark Forest Hypothesis. That would have made more sense in the end. But for being a Netflix series this is the best series they made in years.	first book hard make series think first episode pretty good series go banana second book really hope get second season lot change adaptation make sense western version great job cgi cast story kind slow grow terrify nightmare end bite early would like see time jump second book end guess could tell dark forest hypothesis would make sense end netflix series good series make year

0	"The lite police drama is nice but as a CA native with friends who were actually LAPD its unrealistic that there are no gay or lesbian characters. Almost every other new show is acknowledging and being inclusive. The new buzz word is fluid and this show has no fluidity. It is always amazing to me when shows like this get great reviews while superior shows ""almost family"" (IMO) get canceled but have similar audience scores on rotten tomatoes. Anyway, it is nice to see a show not based on the supernatural or animation."	lite police drama nice ca native friend actually lapd unrealistic gay lesbian character almost every new show acknowledge inclusive new buzz word fluid show fluidity always amaze show like get great review superior show almost family imo get cancel similar audience score rotten tomatoe anyway nice see show base supernatural animation
2	The plot structure is complete, the details are rich, and the creativity is infinite. On the premise of maintaining the flavor of the original, the TV play is more concise and the key points are more prominent. The characters of the play are bright and wonderful. The whole play is not only magnificent in scenes and exquisite in production, but also exquisite in photography, clothing, setting and art. The plot integrates a variety of elements and is dressed in magic. However, it reflects the real world in the illusion, and focuses on the struggle of political power.	plot structure complete detail rich creativity infinite premise maintain flavor original tv play concise key point prominent character play bright wonderful whole play magnificent scene exquisite production also exquisite photography clothe set art plot integrate variety element dress magic however reflect real world illusion focus struggle political power
0	Season 8 the first 2 episodes were good suspenseful however I cant say that for the rest of the season because things began to take place suddenly and the poor writing was one of the many problems in this season.

0	So I've managed to watch almost 2 episodes of this before giving up. If this was an original show, I may have given it the benefit of a doubt, but the creators here have taken on one of the best Sci Fi novels ever written and handled it with the reverse Midas touch, hiring an untalented cast and writing in a bunch of utterly unbelievable characters. Seriously it was easier to believe in the supernatural events depicted than that moronic characters like Auggie or John could pass as groundbreaking scientists. Everything in the book was changed into a stupider version of events. Beautifully written storylines were rushed or discarded altogether, and yet production found the time to graciously spice things up with some unnecessary nudity. It's sad to see what Netflix seems to think of its brainless mass audience. Sad enough for me to cancel my subscription for good.I can only hope that one day another network might pick this trilogy up and treat it with the respect it deserves.Giving this more than 1 star for the visual effects and the China storyline.	manage watch almost episode give original show may give benefit doubt creator take one good sci fi novel ever write handle reverse midas touch hire untalente cast write bunch utterly unbelievable character seriously easy believe supernatural event depict moronic character like auggie john could pass groundbreaking scientist everything book change stupider version event beautifully write storyline rush discard altogether yet production find time graciously spice thing unnecessary nudity sad see netflix seem think brainless mass audience sad enough cancel subscription good hope one day another network might pick trilogy treat respect deserve give star visual effect china storyline

0	While the actors all do their best with the material (hence the 3 stars), this is a badly written show. The Rookie is billed as a drama, but it lost me when John Nolan (Fillion) wasn't shot for standing up and running his mouth with clearly uptight and ready-to-shoot bank robbers. Yes, it was Nathan being Nathan, so it's cute - but the situation wasn't remotely believable. If it were set up for laughs that'd be one thing, but the scene is neither written nor played comically.After that, the show continues to lurch from one unbelievable scene to another. The women are all badass and the men - except for Nathan's character, all have a level of ickiness. Especially the one T.O. who is racist, sexist, and mean, but then, oh gee, we should feel sorry for him because his wife's a drug addict. Yeah,no. Oh, and of course, all the hot women nearly half his age love John Nolan on sight.The whole show is like a middle-aged white male fantasy - right up to the Kill Bill female cop that's Nolan's girlfriend. This is too bad, because the actual true story behind The Rookie is a compelling one. I know ABC wanted a new show for Nathan, but this isn't it. They should just reboot Firefly. After all, that's really what people want to see him in.	actor good material hence star badly write show rookie bill drama lose john nolan fillion shoot stand run mouth clearly uptight ready shoot bank robber yes nathan nathan cute situation remotely believable set laugh one thing scene neither write play comically show continue lurch one unbelievable scene another woman badass man except nathan character level ickiness especially one racist sexist mean oh gee feel sorry wife drug addict yeah oh course hot woman nearly half age love john nolan sight whole show like middle age white male fantasy right kill bill female cop nolan girlfriend bad actual true story behind rookie compel one know abc want new show nathan reboot firefly really people want see
1	I really struggled to get through this tv serious. It does have its moments and at times intriguing, but way too much wishy washy unnecessary fluff for me, rather than moving on with the main story, or even telling it with any depth of detail.Like others have already mentioned, one big problem also is that the characters are just flat without any charisma. Making the show quite bland IMO.And because the story when told, is missing so much in-depth information, you can't help thinking are these major plot holes, when considering the number of light years away the invaders are.If you like Syfy shows like Apple's Invasion, Prime's Hanna, then you are probably going to like it. If you are one that enjoys shows like Battlestar Galactica, Silo, Tales from the Loop & For all Mankind, then the chances are you are not going to get much out of it except feeling tiresome watching it.	really struggle get tv serious moment time intrigue way much wishy washy unnecessary fluff rather move main story even tell depth detail like other already mention one big problem also character flat without charisma make show quite bland imo story tell miss much depth information help think major plot hole consider number light year away invader like syfy show like apple invasion prime hanna probably go like one enjoy show like battlestar galactica silo tales loop mankind chance go get much except feel tiresome watch
0	It's a shame, but nothing like the original story. Even if we consider this as an independent project: the characters are dead and a set of Netflix cliches without motivation, science is absent as well as the educational value of the entire trilogy, the insights and actions of the heroes are random. It is hardly possible to understand what is happening and why. I don't want to at least somehow empathize and sympathize with the characters and the world in the series. But the graphics in the game are not bad. After watching, I had a desire to re-read the books and watch the entire Chinese series in order to kill the negative aftertaste.	shame nothing like original story even consider independent project character dead set netflix cliche without motivation science absent well educational value entire trilogy insight action hero random hardly possible understand happen want least somehow empathize sympathize character world series graphic game bad watch desire read book watch entire chinese series order kill negative aftertaste

I fell asleep three times in two nights watching this program. I kept trying on night three, but it hasn't kept my interest. I'm supposed to write six hundred characters, but I don't find the need to denigrate any this tv show. The Fallout TV show was just not my cup of tea. Enjoy it if you wish. I just found it flat and boring. I guess I've never made a review before, because I find this character limit absolutely pointless too.

1	I admit that I have binged watch the entire show at least 2 or 3 times, however, it should have ended a good 3 seasons ago at least. I feel like they don't know what to do with the show anymore, besides killing people off or having them move away. Since Mc Dreamy died, Meredith lost her flavour. Alex's exit was the last straw, especially the way he hurt Jo so terribly after renewing their vows (even if it was to be with his kids and fist love). Everything in between had some good but also too much drama just butchering everyone's relationships, like Arizona and Callie, how could you destroy a couple so many different ways?! Seriously! Teddy was good the first time around, but is now unbearable and Owen is as always intolerable. A good show needs to know when to call it quits, not leaving people hoping for it to end.	admit binge watch entire show least time however end good season ago least feel like know show anymore besides kill people move away since mc dreamy die meredith lose flavour alex exit last straw especially way hurt jo terribly renew vow even kid fist love everything good also much drama butcher everyone relationship like arizona callie could destroy couple many different way seriously teddy good first time around unbearable owen always intolerable good show need know call quit leave people hop end

2	Been fan of sci-fi series for a long time and this series comes as a pleasant surprise. And since it is a book adaption, surely there have been critics about its adaption especially when they did some westernization with characters and other things but as a watchers who didn't have a clue about the books, the series is splendid.Don't care if the book does certain things better, I didn't disappoint with the series. Surely it takes time but all things are justified with the answers given in an amazingly delivered ep.The choice of using western characters to replace chinese characters make sense if you appeal to a wider audience. And the cast did a great job.The direction is spot on. The visuals are gorgeous and scary tbh. And certain characters are well written and the actors performed them well like Wade, Shi, and Wenjie etc.I am excited for its return and looking forward to an impossible solution of 3-body problem.	fan sci fi series long time series come pleasant surprise since book adaption surely critic adaption especially westernization character thing watcher clue book series splendid care book certain thing well disappoint series surely take time thing justify answer give amazingly deliver ep choice use western character replace chinese character make sense appeal wide audience cast great job direction spot visual gorgeous scary tbh certain character well write actor perform well like wade shi wenjie etc excite return look forward impossible solution body problem
2	Disclaimer: Not a book reader so might be missing some elaborative details A lovely science fiction based upon the theoretical possibilities. This series deserves some background, some knowledge of physics to even understand it so basically it has very narrow viewership and it takes guts to come up with something like that. Team deserves appreciation for that.The interesting dynamics of relationship between the superior aliens (in terms of science) coming to earth to save themselves from chaotic era in their planet and Humans is so neatly presented that you can't help but wonder when the series ends on a cliff hanger.	disclaimer book reader might miss elaborative detail lovely science fiction base upon theoretical possibility series deserve background knowledge physics even understand basically narrow viewership take gut come something like team deserve appreciation interest dynamic relationship superior alien term science come earth save chaotic era planet human neatly present help wonder series end cliff hanger
0	Those giving such stellar reviews have either not read the book or seen the original miniseries which was very faithful to the novel. I'm watching this, but it is a chore... If I was not intimately familiar with the story, I would be hard pressed to follow the plot of this production. Yeah, it's pretty and all, great costumes, but none of the characters are believable in their acting, except maybe Lord Yabu. Mariko looks and acts like she just flew in from modern day Tokyo. And Buntaro? What? There is so much deviation from the book that they should have named it something else. I was really looking forward to this new series, but I'm totally disappointed.	give stellar review either read book see original miniserie faithful novel watch chore intimately familiar story would hard press follow plot production yeah pretty great costume none character believable act except maybe lord yabu mariko look act like fly modern day tokyo buntaro much deviation book name something else really look forward new series totally disappoint
0	The first series was engaging, humorous and exciting- a rare combo. For some reason the writers of the second decided to put spurious social justice issues at the centre of every episode.

1	Read this novel when it was first released and again decades later. I found the first television series with Richard Chamberlain a disappointment mainly because it shortchanged the Japanese characters this has been rectified spectacularly in this new adaptation. The production values are excellent and very much enhances the spectacle of the series. Having the main characters speak in the native tongue was an excellent decision on the producer's enhancement of the production. The only quibble I have with the production is the choice of the actor who portrays John Blackthorne he is very wooden and unconvincing both physically and dramatically.	read novel first release decade later find first television series richard chamberlain disappointment mainly shortchange japanese character rectify spectacularly new adaptation production value excellent much enhance spectacle series main character speak native tongue excellent decision producer enhancement production quibble production choice actor portray john blackthorne wooden unconvincing physically dramatically
2	I read the book many years ago, and barely remember the first TV adaptation. This means I'm watching this new series for what it is, and very little, if any, expectations from either the book or the 1984 series.Two episodes in, I was considering this to be an easy 9 stars, with the possibility of reaching 10 by the end of the series. The cast is excellent, landscapes are beautiful, wardrobe superb, and the dialogs captivating. I was very happy to hear each character speaking his original language instead of that silly thing many productions do by having everybody speaking in english with stupid accents (remember Allô, Allõ!).And then, the show lost a star in my rating when a spanish character speaks in english with the englisman (who, at some point, claims to speak some portuguese). This becomes even more absurd when portuguese and spaniards speak english among themselves. And there are at least two portuguese actors who, again, speak english pretending to speak portuguese! Just pathetic and sad.Another star was lost when the main character starts describing the world, and how the portuguese and the spaniards divided the world in two. The acting is great and with a strong emphasis on how presumptuous it was for those two countries to assume they could just own the world.However, the historic innaccuracies are unacceptable in a show with so many resources available. How hard is it to do some research about the treaty of Tordesilhas?! They could've easily learn that it happened in 1494, about 100 years before the action of the show takes place and not 70 like mentioned by Blackthorne.But that could be a minor mistake until they start talking about how the portuguese and the spanish kings are working together to control the world. That never happened because Portugal and Spain were always enemies. In fact, the english were allies with Portugal even though the first being protestants and the latter catholics. And that description by Blackthorne becomes even more incorrect because it ignores the fact that at the time of the action and for the previous 20 years, Portugal was being ruled by the spanish kings (until 1640)!What a pity... This show could be quite better!	read book many year ago barely remember first tv adaptation mean watch new series little expectation either book series two episode consider easy star possibility reach end series cast excellent landscape beautiful wardrobe superb dialog captivate happy hear character speak original language instead silly thing many production everybody speak english stupid accent remember show lose star rat spanish character speak english englisman point claim speak portuguese become even absurd portuguese spaniard speak english among least two portuguese actor speak english pretend speak portuguese pathetic sad another star lose main character start describe world portuguese spaniard divide world two act great strong emphasis presumptuous two country assume could world however historic innaccuracie unacceptable show many resource available hard research treaty tordesilhas could easily learn happen year action show take place like mention blackthorne could minor mistake start talk portuguese spanish king work together control world never happen portugal spain always enemy fact english ally portugal even though first protestant latter catholic description blackthorne become even incorrect ignore fact time action previous year portugal rule spanish king pity show could quite well
2	"The acting in this show is very good. There are some actors that are at different levels of their careers for sure, but overall the performances are excellent. The writing is for the most part very good, but I do wish sometimes they would slow down a little bit. I think sometimes they try to ""deliver"" and it comes at the cost of a more fleshed out story. This show has so many different nuances going on sometimes it can be a bit much to just ""enjoy"" I'm not familiar with the other versions of this story so it's a lot to take in at first. But with each episode the story does come together. A week between episodes does require a recap. I honestly thing all the bad reviews are quite harsh and not deserved.

He willingly takes drugs with the guy, the signs are there, then goes along with him to get ""totally wasted"" taking some clear liquid... winds up (in his unreliable narrator terms) being raped... keeps going back (even though his professional goals are not advancing in the slightest) does meth heroin, and even LSD, same result. More like stories that come out of the casting couch...He finds accounts on his stalker that show he's not the first yet can't figure out how to block her texts. He finally goes to the police but feels ambiguous about pursuing the complaint because he didn't report his other ""abuser"". Real moral ambiguity there!

1	I am surprised at the 9 and 10 star reviews here. I was awaiting this series after seeing a trailer for it a while back. I have played all of the Fallout games so I knew I would like this series. I loved the scenes with Lucy, the Vaults, and the Brotherhood. My lower review score is due to way too much time spent on the Ghoul's story. I didn't time it but it seemed like he had way more time spent on him than anything else.It came to a point where I began fast forwarding his slow, long winded scenes. I was hoping that Lucy would have kept exploring and picking up the cool weapons and encountering more of the creatures we see from the games. The very last scene was very predictable, but I won't mention it since I don't want to spoil it for others. I have yet seen a Prime series that I like have a complete series, so I wouldn't be surprised if this only lasts for one or two seasons.	surprise star review await series see trailer back play fallout game know would like series love scene lucy vault brotherhood low review score due way much time spend ghoul story time seem like way time spend anything else come point begin fast forward slow long wind scene hop lucy would keep explore pick cool weapon encounter creature see game last scene predictable mention since want spoil other yet see prime series like complete series surprise last one two season
0	The top scientists are a bunch of whiny overly emotional individuals who regularly get drunk or stoned like college kids. This is so unbelievable I could not take this story seriously. They also look like they strolled out right off the modeling walkway. Who thought this kind of casting and melodrama would aid a sci-fi series? And is the new thing for females to regularly threaten male characters with violence and this is supposed to be normal? I was floored when the most emotional scientist would rather let the world be conquered so she could go do humanitarian work in Mexico. The whole premise is a joke.	top scientist bunch whiny overly emotional individual regularly get drink stone like college kid unbelievable could take story seriously also look like stroll right model walkway think kind cast melodrama would aid sci fi series new thing female regularly threaten male character violence suppose normal floor emotional scientist would rather let world conquer could go humanitarian work mexico whole premise joke
1	The aesthetic of this series is absolutely gorgeous. I enjoyed the black and white, and the contrast with the sharp, modern resolution. The cinematography reminded me of the movie Roma, and they both share a leisurely quietude, but the similarities end there.Roma managed to infuse itself with a quiet determination of character and moments of joy. This rendition of The Talented Mr Ripley spends too much time meandering through picturesque hallways and stairs, and not enough time establishing relationships and motive. Beautiful but empty.The casting was also all wrong. All three leads should be in their 20s, but only one is. And of course it's the female character who is young, paired with men who are obviously in their 40s. I wanted to be able to move past it, but it was too distracting, particularly in light of the glacial pacing. Ended up being a beautiful waste of time.	aesthetic series absolutely gorgeous enjoy black white contrast sharp modern resolution cinematography remind movie roma share leisurely quietude similarity end roma manage infuse quiet determination character moment joy rendition talente mr ripley spend much time meand picturesque hallway stair enough time establish relationship motive beautiful empty cast also wrong three lead one course female character young pair man obviously want able move past distract particularly light glacial pace end beautiful waste time

However, the people speaking English are supposed to be speaking Portuguese, what kind of sense does that make?The original with Richard Chamberlain didn't have the type of cruelty that the first episode shows. I suppose that's because today's audience wants something much more edgy, but it certainly doesn't appeal to me.Because it's a saga with interesting costumes, and an interesting location, I imagine it will find its audience, but just a warning to those of us who liked the book and the previous series, don't watch this show.	show make american audience yet japanese subtitle however people speak english suppose speak portuguese kind sense make original richard chamberlain type cruelty first episode show suppose today audience want something much edgy certainly appeal saga interest costume interest location imagine find audience warn we like book previous series watch show

0	"Plot Deviation: Rather than immersing audiences in the intricate world of interstellar conflict and mind-bending scientific concepts, the Netflix adaptation chooses to prioritize mundane drama over the essence of the source material. Instead of delving into the complexities of humanity's encounter with an advanced alien civilization, viewers are subjected to an excessive focus on characters' emotions, thoughts, and interpersonal relationships.Minimal Sci-Fi Content: The most glaring issue with this adaptation is the glaring absence of science fiction elements. Merely a fraction of the runtime is dedicated to exploring the fascinating scientific concepts and existential dilemmas that made the novel such a compelling read. Instead, viewers are left with lengthy stretches of tedious character interactions and melodramatic subplots that add little to the overarching narrative.Overreliance on Forward Button: Thanks to the forward button on the remote, viewers are given the power to bypass the tedious filler content that dominates the majority of the series. With approximately 75% of the runtime consisting of skippable material, one can't help but feel cheated out of the immersive sci-fi experience promised by the source material.Recommendation: For those daring to venture into the disappointing realm of ""The Three-Body Problem"" on Netflix, it's advisable to keep the remote handy.

2	"Ripley is a well directed series. It is a bit slow developing, however the cinematography and pacing is spot on. The entire series is done in black and white. Similar to another movie for this director (Schindler's list).I was hesitant to watch the series as I did not enjoy the theatrical version with Matt Damon. Possibly because I was a much younger man? Maybe I need to go back and watch it? Please reply with your thoughts.This is a binge worthy series. So get your popcorn and cuddle up with your significant other and enjoy. It can be a bit stressful watching Ripley do his thing. Just make note.Lastly, the singer ""Sting"" has a ""non binary"" daughter that plays ""Freddie"" Sorry for all the """" She is a fine actress. But her role was very confusing. She plays a guy. Everyone says she is a guy. But she is clearly a woman that is trying so hard to have a deep voice.

I am only on episode two. I am still struggling with the age difference.Also finding things bland. I try to understand the new concept but it's rather boring. Why?Don't know if they are going to leave out the homosexual aspect (Malkovich) but I can only hope they try to somewhat follow the real character.	read whole series book watch movie review criticism actor also understand lienency follow book however year old go pose year old otherwise tom suppose much old limit series even cgi go help make young please get wrong episode two still struggle age difference also find thing bland try understand new concept rather bore know go leave homosexual aspect malkovich hope try somewhat follow real character

The characters are carefully developed and acted out brilliantly by each and every actor, without exception. The translation/flow from Italian to English is seamless; rare for any film or TV series. Have always marvelled at the rich cultural heritage in art and architecture that Italy has offered to world and this is showcased wonderfully in this series. This one surpasses the original ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" film, again a rare occurrence. What's next for this brilliant director?

1	Nathan Fillion carries this show but his talent is lost here. The rest of the cast do their best to make something out of a script that wildly swings from drama, to comedy, to out right parody. Not only do this shows name get inaccurate pretty quickly. But looses some of its charm when the Rookie races through his traning and end up being the most effective cop in the history of the LAPD. At times this show is entertaining but its quality remains very uneven. The Rookie struggles to find its own identity. I would love to see what this cast could do on a show that would have a better script. At the time of writing this review the 5th season is running, and have been green lighted for a 6th. I will not be following that far.	nathan fillion carry show talent lose rest cast well make something script wildly swing drama comedy right parody show name get inaccurate pretty quickly loose charm rookie race traning end effective cop history lapd time show entertain quality remain uneven rookie struggle find identity would love see cast could show would better script time write review th season run green light th follow far

2	I've had 3 Body Problem on my reading list for about three years but have been reading other books and down prioritised it. This is no longer the case after watching this first season, that is somewhere between a 8 and a 9 for me.The back story is brilliant and very innovative, at least for me and I have read and seen my share of sci-fi. I was very disturbed by the fact that D&D were doing this but in hindsight, they did a very good job with Game of Thrones when they had source material (i.e the first 4-5 seasons) but far from good without source material. If they just keep to the books and end this in 3 seasons they will be redeeming themselves a bit from the GoT (season 6-8 (especially 8))disaster.I very much look forward for reading the books this summer and the second season.	body problem read list three year read book prioritise long case watch first season somewhere back story brilliant innovative least read see share sci fi disturb fact hindsight good job game throne source material e first season far good without source material keep book end season redeem bite get season especially disaster much look forward read book summer second season

1	"There are many aspects about this series that I love. The cinematography is beautiful. The choice for B&W works. Others complained about the pacing, but I liked it. It's a great looking show and well written.There are however a lot of things that irritated me. For one, the casting of Andrew Scott as Ripley. He is too old for the role. And he made the character seem unintelligent and charmless. Why would Dickie and Marge be his friend? Why would they invite him anywhere? Both Dickie and Ripley lacked a certain mid-century, classic ""American-ness"" in their roles for obvious reasons.The casting of Freddie felt a bit off for me as well.Overall, I thought it was a good effort. But just a bit flat. Beautiful but flat."	many aspect series love cinematography beautiful choice b w work other complain pace like great look show well write however lot thing irritate one cast andrew scott ripley old role make character seem unintelligent charmless would dickie marge friend would invite anywhere dickie ripley lack certain mid century classic american ness role obvious reason cast freddie feel bite well overall think good effort bite flat beautiful flat

And then my experience with the ""2nd"" episode was also very good even tho something seemed off. It was at 41 minutes into the ""2nd"" episode that I checked and realized it was playing episode 8. At this point the whole story was spoiled for me and watching the show was completely pointless. I was incredibly disappointed with this being the case because everything I had viewed was fantastic but also ruined the whole series for me. I'm sure if I was able to see the whole show my rating would be an 8/10 but I have the worst taste left in my mouth left for the show after my experience.

1	...but they killed off the best actor in episode nine. Mariko really carried the show. Meanwhile the Blackthorne actor was the absolute worst. I'm sure they made him look even weaker when compared to the strong Japanese cast. And I do think episodes seven through nine dragged on a little too long. Too much focus on the ancillary characters rather than moving ahead on the plans to defeat the Council of Regents. And let me say it again, Mariko and the actor that portrayed her should have been alive at the end. Just a sorry way to end an otherwise interesting and well played series. Also, contributes to the history of Japan albeit in a fictional context.	kill good actor episode nine mariko really carry show meanwhile blackthorne actor absolute bad sure make look even weak compare strong japanese cast think episode seven nine drag little long much focus ancillary character rather move ahead plan defeat council regent let say mariko actor portray alive end sorry way end otherwise interest well play series also contribute history japan albeit fictional context

1	As a long time Fallout fan, I was really looking forward to this show. Having seen all of it now, I'm not really disappointed, but let down. If you've never played any of the games, I think this show will be of great interest to anyone who likes science fiction. But for those of us who are dedicated fans (hundreds of hours in 3 and New Vegas, and thousands of hours in 4,) this show will miss the mark. But really only slightly. Everything you'd expect to be in this show is here, but the tone is off. Everyone is very happy-go-lucky for too long into the season. And serious moments are always cut with some sort of humor. I would encourage everyone to watch and judge for themselves, but go in with tempered expectations.	long time fallout fan really look forward show see really disappoint let never play game think show great interest anyone like science fiction we dedicate fan hundred hour new vegas thousand hour show miss mark really slightly everything expect show tone everyone happy go lucky long season serious moment always cut sort humor would encourage everyone watch judge go temper expectation
2	Awesome series as mentioned by other reviewers. But for me, spoilt by the frequent blurry backgrounds and bottom of screen. I understand this is because of the specific camera lens that they have used. For me it was far too distracting. In one scene, the corners of the screen are curved like CCTV footage!!Apart from the spoilt visuals, the story is very gripping with great characters, a little bit like Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.Definitely worth watching and one of the best series I have seen. Can't wait for the next series!I'm not sure why they used those lenses to film this, there are online posts that go into it.	awesome series mention reviewer spoil frequent blurry background bottom screen understand specific camera lens use far distract one scene corner screen curve like cctv footage apart spoil visual story grip great character little bite like akira kurosawa seven samurai definitely worth watch one good series see wait next series sure use lense film online post go
2	"1) Cinematic, multimillion dollar special effects, CGI, set design, production valuesThe visual effects for a TV show are absolutely phenomenal. Usually, you will experience them with the dragons and along the primary female protagonist, Daenerys Targaryan's journey, or in the truly epic battle scenes that can hold their own with the best modern movies that have battlefield scenes.2) Maise Williams- As the series goes on, she becomes the standout ""star"" of the show. It is both unexpected and ironic to watch her develop as just a side character into a movie star. Not sure which direction her career will go after this, or if parts like this will ever emerge again, but it's hard not to fall in love with her character and story.3) Daenerys Targaryan- Similarly to Maise's Arya, Emilia Clarke's Danaerys' journey from oppressed teenager sold into marriage to a barbarian to discovering her dragon power and then realizing her potential as a freer of slaves, breaker of chains, and heroine as she battles villains, backstabbers, and enemies while making friends and raising her dragons in hopes to rule the Iron Throne is imo the best storyline in the show, about tied with Arya's. Dany's story is an adventure through the eastern hemisphere of Westeros as she gains wisdom and worldliness from her intuition and advisors, with the primary advisor being Mormont.4) Battle Scenes and Shocking Twists combined. The famous battle scenes and shocking twists are worth the watch alone, even if they are viewed independently. They would give any newcomer to the show an idea of why the show is so famous and would probably entice them to give it a watch. Of course, for context, the show should be viewed from the beginning, but these are must sees for all movie or television fans.5) Competent and above average writing and acting for a TV series throughout. It's not on Breaking Bad's level of writing, but it has its moments and is almost up there, and the acting as a whole is above average for television.Overall, Game of Thrones is an excellent television show. It ultimately received lots of criticism for its 8th season, but it wasn't all bad, just disappointing. The show is still better than other popular shows of the decade or two, shows like Dexter, Walking Dead, Mad Men, Sons of Anarchy, and the Wire. It is in a genre of its own (fantasy/war/adventure) so it is hard to compare with the great dramas. It is the best show of its genre and just below Breaking Bad on the list. They are the two best shows of their genres.The primary issues with the show arose in the final 2 seasons, and yes, at times it really was ""that"" bad and criticism was warranted. From heavy cheesy dialogue to laughable plot armor to butchering character arcs and storylines by ignoring all that preceded the information given for six to seven seasons before it, to diminishing the scenes time and lines of the show's best villains and characters, to arguably making a parody of the ending, to an abundance of illogical and nonsensical story events, and at critical times coming off as like a bad soap opera written by teenagers.8/10"	cinematic multimillion dollar special effect cgi set design production valuesthe visual effect tv show absolutely phenomenal usually experience dragon along primary female protagonist daenery targaryan journey truly epic battle scene hold good modern movie battlefield scene maise williams series go become standout star show unexpected ironic watch develop side character movie star sure direction career go part like ever emerge hard fall love character story daenery targaryan similarly maise arya emilia clarke danaerys journey oppress teenager sell marriage barbarian discover dragon power realize potential free slave breaker chain heroine battle villain backstabber enemy make friend raise dragon hop rule iron throne imo good storyline show tie arya dany story adventure eastern hemisphere westeros gain wisdom worldliness intuition advisor primary advisor mormont battle scene shock twist combine famous battle scene shock twist worth watch alone even view independently would give newcomer show idea show famous would probably entice give watch course context show view begin must see movie television fan competent average write act tv series throughout break bad level write moment almost act whole average television overall game throne excellent television show ultimately receive lot criticism th season bad disappoint show still well popular show decade two show like dexter walk dead mad man son anarchy wire genre fantasy war adventure hard compare great drama well show genre break bad list two good show genre primary issue show arise final season yes time really bad criticism warrant heavy cheesy dialogue laughable plot armor butcher character arc storyline ignore precede information give six seven season diminish scene time line show good villain character arguably make parody end abundance illogical nonsensical story event critical time come like bad soap opera write teenager
0	"3 Body Problem (3/21/24, scifi, 8 eps, 1-hr, Netflix) This is the much anticipated tv adaptation of the fabled book series. But let me cut to the chase since this was a serious disappointment for me and apparently many, many others. I only made it through two eps before calling time of death. First, though it's largely written by the GoT duo - D&D - this is a very boring, dry, and just dumb adaptation. I'm tired of ""legends"" insulting my intelligence by spewing forth trash though it's lined with Netflix's gold. There were legit stupid, nonsensical plot points in the first two eps and I just won't tolerate that. Add to that all the excessive - stupid - cigarette smoking and them calling the headset thing a game when it's clearly a simulation at the least. Just unforgiveable stuff.

1	...it wasn't presented to me in 4K HDR and yet I found the imagery much more enthralling.It was translated, subtitled, and spent much more time explaining science and engineering concepts, and yet I found the dialogue much less insulting.It didn't have Eiza Gonzalez, but also, it didn't have Eiza Gonzalez. (picking on Eiza as a famous name here, but in general I found the show to be miscast).It can't be binge-watched (or you will likely find it too long), but in trade you are really able to understand the characters and their motivations.It does a much better job in creating mystery and suspense and the action scenes are much better.Although the 3-body story clearly takes liberties in imagining the bounds based on current modern science, this is really what makes it great and I feel like the roots in real science were lost in the Netflix version. The Tencent version did a good job in presenting a story that is beautiful, interesting, at times exciting, but also seemingly very authentic.While the Tencent version did seem a little long to me, I think society (including myself) needs to keep some practice at having the patience to enjoy something that is not always fast moving with over-emotional characters, simple dialogue, and instant gratification.	present k hdr yet find imagery much enthral translate subtitle spend much time explain science engineer concept yet find dialogue much less insult eiza gonzalez also eiza gonzalez pick eiza famous name general find show miscast binge watch likely find long trade really able understand character motivation much well job create mystery suspense action scene much well although body story clearly take liberty imagine bind base current modern science really make great feel like root real science lose netflix version tencent version good job present story beautiful interest time excite also seemingly authentic tencent version seem little long think society include need keep practice patience enjoy something always fast move emotional character simple dialogue instant gratification
0	"I don't play video games, so the trailer had me expecting an dystopian thriller with a satirical edge, perhaps along the lines of Robocop. And the sheer number of 10/10 reviews, right here, calling it ""phenomenal,"" ""clever"", ""mind-blowing,"" etc., sure had me stoked...I was not expecting slapstick.Be warned: Fallout is the ""Dumb & Dumber"" of apocalyptic series. In fact, that's far too kind. Fallout is the ""Dumb & Dumber To"" of apocalyptic series. It is all gags, relentlessly, and about 1 in 9 land.The characters use bottle-caps for currency, love Jell-o cake, enjoy having their codpieces polished, and sometimes have great-uncles who are amphibians.""Clever,"" remember.The attempts at satire are so nonstop, the jokes so never-ending, that it makes Rick & Morty feels like a drama. I'm not being hyperbolic. Episode 1 of Fallout starts out like a thriller with layers of dark comedy, but ""thriller"" and ""dark"" are dropped entirely by Episode Two. It's just zany, goofy low-stakes gore and potty humor after that.""You had your finger hacked off?"" Asks a crazed robot-doctor. ""There! I've given you a brand new finger! Now I'm going to harvest your organs!"" (That scene actually happens.)I do enjoy idiotic TV, as much as the next guy... I just prefer to know what I'm buying into, ahead of time. This show is complete idiocy, by design, and that's fine... My review is only to warn you that this is nothing in the vein of, say, The Last Of Us or Silo. There is no drama, there is no darkness, and there are no thrills to be had.Just jokes. One after the other. Infinitely.On the technical side: A major fight between an Iron Man and a zombie gunslinger, in Episode Two, is filmed with the skill of Godzilla vs. Megalon. (By the lesser of the Nolan Brothers, apparently). If they were aiming for Monty Python, I guess they nailed it.So, 4 stars, since this is probably intended for people who laugh at farts, and they're obviously thrilled about it."	play video game trailer expect dystopian thriller satirical edge perhaps along line robocop sheer number review right call phenomenal clever mind blow etc sure stoke expect slapstick warn fallout dumb dumber apocalyptic series fact far kind fallout dumb dumber apocalyptic series gag relentlessly land character use bottle cap currency love jell cake enjoy codpiece polish sometimes great uncle amphibian clever remember attempt satire nonstop joke never end make rick morty feel like drama hyperbolic episode fallout start like thriller layer dark comedy thriller dark drop entirely episode two zany goofy low stake gore potty humor finger hack ask craze robot doctor give brand new finger go harvest organ scene actually happen enjoy idiotic tv much next guy prefer know buy ahead time show complete idiocy design fine review warn nothing vein say last we silo drama darkness thrill joke one infinitely technical side major fight iron man zombie gunslinger episode two film skill godzilla vs megalon less nolan brother apparently aim monty python guess nail star since probably intend people laugh fart obviously thrill
1	GOT used to be so good in its early seasons, but now that the final season is over, we should rejudge the whole show in a different light.Undisputedly, the first four seasons of GOT are simply the best. They successfully changed and redefined the whole fantasy genre since Tolkien's inception of Middle Earth. Their legacy would be enshrined in pop culture for decades to come.But the final few seasons have gone downhill since the show run out of the original source materials, and eventually turned in to a pile of irredeemable garbage. All the character arcs ruined, all the plot developments abandoned, and all the world settings ignored. The ignorance and arrogance of David Benioff and D. B. Weiss are directly responsible for the downfall of GOT and these two incompetent buffoons must be stopped before they get their dirty hands on the Star Wars franchise.

2	"Baby Reindeer is Netflix's gripping new 8-part series that follows the bizarre and unsettling real-life interactions between a stalker and comedian Richard Gadd, whose character is named Donny. Through intimate, beautifully poetic monologues written and spoken by Richard Gadd himself, and unsettling encounters with Martha, played by Jessica Gunning, it delves deep into the psyche of both predator and prey, leaving viewers both disturbed and captivated. Baby Reindeer reveals the chilling complexities of desire, validation, and obsession, whilst exploring the intricate dynamics of infatuation and manipulation, whether it's platonic, romantic, or professional.The show begins lighthearted and funny, but then descends into darkness, portraying experiences of grooming, sexual assault and rape. Whilst many scenes were incredibly hard and distressing to watch, others were eye-wateringly honest and open. Hauntingly portrayed is a subconscious coping mechanism, where after sexual assault the abused may begin to sexualise the violence experienced, reclaiming its power or replaying the moments in hopes to understand what and how transpired in a guilt inducing confusion, which I have not yet seen play out in another TV show or film so sensitivly or honestly.Donny's self-destructive aftermath and the craving for approval, even from the abuser, only fed his insecurities. The desperate need for validation and the frequent threads of pity are palpable throughout, intertwined with the importance of parental acceptance and support. As the series progresses, it becomes a harrowing tale of two individuals grappling with their own demons and desperately seeking healing amidst a tumultuous journey of obsession and madness.Donny's struggle with following his dreams of fame as a comedian is enough to send someone into a spiral, as he faced failure repetitively. This greatly reflects the fluctuation of highs and lows in so called 'unconventional careers'. I found the scene where Donny bares his soul in a tearful confession in episode 7 to be very cleverly introduced. In an earlier episode, his comedy sets within the Edinburgh Fringe Festival open with a loud (both in volume and fashion), flamboyant, full of energy entrance, with music and hip thrusting, he then abruptly stops and leads with ""my mum died today"". This style of juxtaposition comedy bled into real life, as in the penultimate episode Donny breaks down on stage sharing all of the awful experiences and stress he has endured. As the crowd sits in an awkward silence, he then plays his jingle about condoms and popadoms on a noise maker, and then leaves the stage. The set became him and swallowed him whole.Jessica Gunning's ability to unravel on screen was utterly impressive, and I was conflicted with seeing her as the villain when so clearly troubled and unwell. Richard Gadd's genuine vulnerability and bravery within Baby Reindeer is an unforgettable performance, and even more so knowing that these are his life experiences and own words.In the end, I believe Martha and Donny share many similarities, whether Donny would like to admit it or not. They start out both as dreamers, lost in their imaginations and aspirations for the future. They are ceaseless when it comes to something they love and yearn for, for Donny appreciation and comedy, and for Martha, appreciation and Donny. Martha noticed his pain, which he recognises when he said ""Martha saw me the way I wanted to be seen"". And Donny saw hers, even if in the form of a free cup of tea.

0	Many fine actors in this series. I would once give it high ratings but in 2021 the writing has become gawd awful with its pre-occupation with preaching at us rather than entertaining us with stories of what police officers (including black, asian and female officers) can and do accomplish everyday on the job.	many fine actor series would give high rat write become gawd awful pre occupation preach we rather entertain we story police officer include black asian female officer accomplish everyday job

The set design (cgi or not), costumes, directing, editing and sound are all top notch. The dialogue can be cutting and clever but also arch and melodramatic. The desperate and menacing and oh so important conversations frankly started to blur together in my head. Just when your attention might wander breasts or a new extreme in atrocities is served to remind you how cool and hardcore this world is. After a while I started to wonder how anyone is still alive in this world. Where does all this fodder come from? But for sure thousands of lives will be readily available for extinguishing next time the audience might be getting bored or needs to be reminded how nasty somebody is.	game throne medieval fantasy deadwood western like deadwood game throne amp viciousness time ridiculous degree act terrific set design cgi costume direct edit sound top notch dialogue cut clever also arch melodramatic desperate menace oh important conversation frankly start blur together head attention might wander breast new extreme atrocity serve remind cool hardcore world start wonder anyone still alive world fodder come sure thousand live readily available extinguish next time audience might get bore need remind nasty somebody

1	I loved grey's anatomy! And for me until season 9-10 it was watchable. After that, I came across an episode of 15 season and apart from Meredith Grey -who is really a supporting role now- I maybe knew 1-2 actors. All the cast is replaced, it is a totally different show with the same name and repetitive storyline. I mean why take such a wonderful series and make it this distasteful thing that nobody watches any more?? You earned quite a lot of money and you dragged it so much that in the end I thing it's gonna be cancelled...	love grey anatomy season watchable come across episode season apart meredith grey really support role maybe know actor cast replace totally different show name repetitive storyline mean take wonderful series make distasteful thing nobody watch earn quite lot money drag much end thing go to cancel
0	"(UPDATE: I am leaving my original negative review for this series below, but adding this preface since I just watched the first two episodes of the original Chinese series, which is already much better. In the 2nd episode of the Chinese version they go into a detailed metaphor of ""physics is broken"" using a pool table. Now I get what's missing in the Netflix version: this show is supposed to be about the science. The way the new US series abbreviates those elements takes away the most important part of the show. That's why I gave is the bad review below.)Since I watched the whole series I feel compelled to write a review. This is either a bad adaptation of a good book or an accurate adaptation of a bad book. I don't know since I never read it. But after an intriguing first 3 episodes the story becomes full of holes and strained attempts at emotional moments. The characters seemed plastic neo-generic caricatures. What should have been huge dramatic moments felt rushed. I mean, the night sky blinks on and off and somehow the world goes back to normal after a few days? I dunno. There was no scope to this story. It should have been longer and had a wider societal breadth. There must be something from the novel they didn't capture because there were a lot of unexplained cryptic exchanges... especially in the joke that Ye tells Saul. I was waiting for that to take on some relevance in the story but... nope. I have a feeling it was cryptic information on how to fight the aliens...? Maybe it's explained in season 2... if there is one? Otherwise, why all focus on that story? And the subplot about the man who was dying of cancer...? They kept trying to create these moving moments but failing, imo. I didn't care what happened to the guy. So they sent his brain into space so the aliens could clone him... maybe? It just doesn't make any sense. And whoever wrote that scene where they use the nanofibers to slice up the ship doesn't understand anything about the Panama Canal. The ships have to move into locks where the water level is changed. There are hundreds of way they could have secured that ship while it was in a lock. It just seemed like such an over the top way to get the disc. I continued watching mainly because I was genuinely curious to see where it would all wind up. But I must admit it was almost as big a let down as the end of season 1 of ""From"". In the end it's just another story about aliens coming to take our stuff. And that just seems so old school now. While it wasn't awful it was a little plastic to me."	update leave original negative review series add preface since watch first two episode original chinese series already much well nd episode chinese version go detail metaphor physics break use pool table get miss netflix version show suppose science way new us series abbreviate element take away important part show give bad review since watch whole series feel compel write review either bad adaptation good book accurate adaptation bad book know since never read intrigue first episode story become full hole strain attempt emotional moment character seem plastic neo generic caricature huge dramatic moment feel rush mean night sky blink somehow world go back normal day dunno scope story long wide societal breadth must something novel capture lot unexplained cryptic exchange especially joke ye tell saul wait take relevance story nope feel cryptic information fight alien maybe explain season one otherwise focus story subplot man die cancer keep try create move moment fail imo care happen guy send brain space alien could clone maybe make sense whoever write scene use nanofiber slice ship understand anything panama canal ship move lock water level change hundred way could secure ship lock seem like top way get disc continue watch mainly genuinely curious see would wind must admit almost big let end season end another story alien come take stuff seem old school awful little plastic

1	"I'll be very brief. This show is the equivalent of cheap booze with whiskey aromaIf you're in bar drinking low quality spirits, and here comes that counterfeit drink that has some Macallan aroma you'll clearly drink that for the rest of the night.This is this show, if you're seeing the ideas for the first time, you'll be: ""yeah decent, 8/10"" because the 'cool beats' are all straight up ripped from the books.""But hey dear reviewer, this is an adaptation, what nonsense are you spilling, ofc they have books 'stuff' ""Well sure, but almost everything that should've been original about this show is of a poor quality and the book stuff is a downgrade.I'm sorry but rewatch this show and you'll quickly realise that the dialogue is unnatural, that's not how friends talk, the interpersonal relationships this show tries to build are not natural. The plot itself doesn't make sense.In the books, the 'power levels' of 'something' (to avoid spoilers) are toned down. Here they are cranked to 11 which makes the story the show tries to tell absolutely not fit with the book story, yet the show desperately has to dumb down or 'guess X forgot' to make the story fit.Why 6? Because the crew, VFX, cinematography, all the auxiliary stuff is all there. Heck, even a lot of actors are doing their job mighty fine. But those all things that you can buy with money and are pretty standardized nowadays.And with the books as a spinal cord, it makes it an above average show (above 5/10 - that's what average means ... )"	brief show equivalent cheap booze whiskey aromaif bar drink low quality spirit come counterfeit drink macallan aroma clearly drink rest night show see idea first time yeah decent cool beat straight rip book hey dear reviewer adaptation nonsense spill ofc book stuff well sure almost everything original show poor quality book stuff downgrade sorry rewatch show quickly realise dialogue unnatural friend talk interpersonal relationship show try build natural plot make sense book power level something avoid spoiler tone crank make story show try tell absolutely fit book story yet show desperately dumb guess x forget make story fit crew vfx cinematography auxiliary stuff heck even lot actor job mighty fine thing buy money pretty standardize nowadays book spinal cord make average show average mean
1	The main problem is how hammy the authors are when showing all the on-the-agenda problems - with more subtlety it could be much more watchable and the characters won't be saying or doing things they normally wouldn't.	main problem hammy author show agenda problem subtlety could much watchable character say thing normally
2	Most 1-4 star reviews are the book warriors. They claim that's its poorly adapted etc. I mean, it is not a classic, so who cares? The story is very entertaining. So I personally clearly recommend not to listen to these reviews. Since it is actually a really good series. Building up nice excitement and holding it till the end. Not a fan of each character to be honest. But even some annoying folks cannot harm the spirit of this series. And it is not a happy Disney story, oh no, don't worry. Some moments are truly shocking. And not so far away as other science fiction. Leaving you back with real awkwardness and what if moments.Enjoyed every minute of the show.	star review book warrior claim poorly adapt etc mean classic care story entertain personally clearly recommend listen review since actually really good series build nice excitement hold till end fan character honest even annoy folk harm spirit series happy disney story oh worry moment truly shock far away science fiction leave back real awkwardness moment enjoy every minute show

2	The Netflix series 3 BODY PROBLEM is in my opinion the most significant Science Fiction work to come life on screen since Arthur C. Clarke's 2001 A Space Odyssey. Behind the cinematic production we find the team that created GAME OF THRONES. The series may seem confusing at first but hang in there, once the core precepts become clear to you the revelation of the fresh thinking going on here will make you feel like a pioneer, as great science fiction should. If you miss watching this you are likely to miss a critically important next step in the development of human consciousness. This is an important work that prepares human consciousness for the progression of the stellar expansion of human civilisation from where we are now, to the next steps.	netflix series body problem opinion significant science fiction work come life screen since arthur c clarke space odyssey behind cinematic production find team create game throne series may seem confuse first hang core precept become clear revelation fresh think go make feel like pioneer great science fiction miss watch likely miss critically important next step development human consciousness important work prepare human consciousness progression stellar expansion human civilisation next step
0	I get that you have to make some adaptations to turn a book series into a TV series. I really do. But they honestly killed the thing that made this science fiction work really shine, which was the science.The little things, like a physicist jumping into a comically large, horribly computer-animated, water Cherenkov detector (and it's not super k, it's in England for some reason?) really draw you out of everything. Or the stupid monkey who is thawed from cryogenic temperature in 4 seconds. Or making the stars blink instead of the CMB. Or what is this huge accelerator at Oxford? Or the aliens just transmitting Chinese with no further explanation how.I don't feel like the writers are treating me as a thinking adult, but as a child, passively watching in the background with my phone in one hand and a bag of Cheetos in the other.The source material deserved better.	get make adaptation turn book series tv series really honestly kill thing make science fiction work really shine science little thing like physicist jump comically large horribly computer animate water cherenkov detector super k england reason really draw everything stupid monkey thaw cryogenic temperature second make star blink instead cmb huge accelerator oxford alien transmit chinese explanation feel like writer treat think adult child passively watch background phone one hand bag cheeto source material deserve well
1	If you're familiar with the books this series is based on, and you were able to at least get through the first book (The Three-Body Problem), then there's a good chance you liked that book but won't enjoy this Netflix series. I say this because reading that book can be challenging, not because it's boring or uninteresting, but because the story is so science-heavy and the otherworldly concepts so overwhelming. The most interesting character in the story is Je Wenjie, the link between the past and present and well presented in this TV adaptation. Then there's Wang Miao, a nanotechnology professor and the single protagonist driving most of the story in present day China. Benioff, Weiss (and Netflix) decided to turn this single protagonist into the circle of friends you see in the show, living in present day London. There's a lot of tension, anxiety and paranoia in the book, as the single protagonist, along with detective Shi Qiang, try to figure all these stuff out--it's a lot like reading a Philip K Dick short story. Unfortunately, all this is lost in the TV adaptation. The show creators decided to water everything down for a wider audience by diluting the story concepts and rearranging some of the characters and events. Yes, there's more character depth in this Netflix adaptation, but they often distract from the story rather than driving it. The characters added to the show weren't structured well enough for the story to make sense. What makes the book grandiose and intellectually challenging--from figuring out the three-body phenomena in the virtual game, to the ingenuity aliens and humans use to manipulate or one-up one another--is kind of lost here. You want your audience to figure things out along with the characters, not random characters revealing major plot points for the general audience. Most of the spectacle, secondary characters and major story points are presented well, so if you haven't read the books, this adaptation is probably worth a watch.	familiar book series base able least get first book three body problem good chance like book enjoy netflix series say read book challenge bear uninteresting story science heavy otherworldly concept overwhelm interest character story je wenjie link past present well present tv adaptation wang miao nanotechnology professor single protagonist drive story present day china benioff weiss netflix decide turn single protagonist circle friend see show live present day london lot tension anxiety paranoia book single protagonist along detective shi qiang try figure stuff lot like read philip k dick short story unfortunately lose tv adaptation show creator decide water everything wide audience dilute story concept rearrange character event yes character depth netflix adaptation often distract story rather drive character add show structure well enough story make sense make book grandiose intellectually challenge figure three body phenomena virtual game ingenuity alien human use manipulate one one another kind lose want audience figure thing along character random character reveal major plot point general audience spectacle secondary character major story point present well read book adaptation probably worth watch

You are cashing on epidemics and global misery? Seriously? How is this abomination of show still on? It used to be kinda fun and spicy sometimes, which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars. Now it's just awful, dull, boring and cringey as hell. I wasn't the biggest fan to begin with but at least it used to have some qualities in first seasons. No wonder so many ""doctors"" got killed because actors desperately wanted to leave this sinking ship.Interestingly enough, nurses in this hospital do not exist. Doctors do everything, because who needs nurses, right? And apparently no one has life or love outside of freaking hospital. They all slept with each other but with no one who does not work with them. Peculiar, isn't it. And they are under constant 24hour stress. No human being would survive all that stress and abuse and still have full make up and great hairstyle with peachy skin. One doctor is in coma and she still has perfect hair!And Meredith, the main character has such horribly bad luck in life it's bizarre. After almost 20 seasons it's enough. The latest beach visions are just bizarre, especially with visions of people who died at much much younger age than they look in visions. They aged after death?

2	I see lot of reviews on the flaws in the adaptation. I havent read the book so cant comment. If I have to assume there is no book and its just a show, its very entertaining. It kept me hooked through all the episodes. The visual effects were fantastic. The acting is very good and story keeps good pace. The only disappointment is, that I have to watch future seasons to see how it ends.The most appealing part are the religious connotations which you notice, if you watch carefully. Assuming that a higher unknown power will be benevolent and solve all your problems. Killing an unknown person for a leader or entity you don't even know exists or will meet.Quite looking forward to the next season.	see lot review flaw adaptation have not read book can not comment assume book show entertain keep hook episode visual effect fantastic act good story keep good pace disappointment watch future season see end appeal part religious connotation notice watch carefully assume high unknown power benevolent solve problem kill unknown person leader entity even know exist meet quite look forward next season

Not everything supposed to be lessons every show that I watch started to feel like the same they cut the edges of the bradford the cops are now more in to the black community.

2	It's easy to be a pessimist in film and tv now in days. I'm not different. I had zero hope in this series, but it truly does deliver. I am already watching it again. Where there are some questions of lore accuracy and the somewhat shoe horned romance doesn't feel necessary, it is just fun. I had fun watching it and truly love the use of practical effects when done. I do hope they keep steering in that direction, but just watch. I had a good time both times!It keeps the whimsy of the wasteland while having the grim aspects. I do wish the world was a little bigger?

1	Im a hardcore Fallout fan and have played through all fallouts from Fallout 3 forwards, and couldn't stick watching past the pilot ep.The show looks visually cool, but everything else is bland and expectable. All characters except the cowboy ghoul are unrelatable and annoying. The dialogue is bland and does not grasp your attention at all. Most actors are neverheard nobodys and don't bring anything cool to the table. The music score is overused, modern scifi-style drone stuff and does not fit into the setting. Wacky and uncomfortable humor kinda breaks the immersion. Most jarring thing is that every scene makes the whole thing feel like a Disney movie made for kids. Every bad guy with evil intentions can be sensed from mile away and character actions in fight scenes are over the top madness. Aside from the ghoul, the pilot episode lacked any sense of seriousness which I was expecting considering the gritty post-apocalyptic fallout setting.If you see yourself as a serious Fallout fan, I do not recommend watching this. If you have not played the games and are interested, maybe give it a try. Anyway, the best you'll be getting is a mediocre show with bland dialogue, uninteresting characters and predictable plot. Not worth my time IMO.

2	I admit I have a soft spot for private detective drama's whatever the time frame and this looks to be a good one. The genre relies on a strong male lead with some kind of vulnerability and Colin Farrell as Sugar completely embodies the requirement. All the cool you expect from the genre is on display, the car, the suits, the neon, every box ticked. The plot conforms to all the requirements, wealthy man hires private eye to find granddaughter, money is no object, all is not as it seems, dark secrets, etc. The directorial style and cinematography really lift this piece and the referencing to classic noir enhances the look. We're only two episodes in so it could go badly off the rails but as I say, if the reviewer at The Guardian hates it then it is going to be good.	admit soft spot private detective drama whatever time frame look good one genre rely strong male lead kind vulnerability colin farrell sugar completely embody requirement cool expect genre display car suit neon every box tick plot conform requirement wealthy man hire private eye find granddaughter money object seem dark secret etc directorial style cinematography really lift piece reference classic noir enhance look two episode could go badly rail say reviewer guardian hat go good
2	Fallout mainly takes place more than 200 years in the future after what was apparently an all-out nuclear war in the 1950's. There are several extended flashbacks to events in the 1950's leading to the nuclear apocalypse. The post-apocalypse world is quite complicated with several different factions and groups competing with each other. Some characters have managed to survive the entire 200 year period from the initial apocalypse to the present time of the show. There are many great songs from the 50's and 60's in the show. Two of the main characters, Lucy and Maximus, are absolutely delightful and often very funny. There are many very funny scenes and dialogue here. In addition, the show is well-plotted with many mysteries that are gradually unraveled. The final show of the first season leaves open several plot questions, so hopefully we can look forward to another season or two. The only negatives are that the physical appearance of the ghouls is horrifying and disgusting. The other negative is too many gun battles with people getting their heads blown off and etc.	fallout mainly take place year future apparently nuclear war several extend flashback event lead nuclear apocalypse post apocalypse world quite complicate several different faction group compete character manage survive entire year period initial apocalypse present time show many great song show two main character lucy maximus absolutely delightful often funny many funny scene dialogue addition show well plot many mystery gradually unravel final show first season leave open several plot question hopefully look forward another season two negative physical appearance ghoul horrify disgust negative many gun battle people get head blow etc

1	"Greys anatomy is an interesting show, because even in its ""grace period"" it is a flawed, often overly sentimental and whiny show, which focuses on some of the most insufferable, selfish and insecure surgeons on TV. One of the couples in this show luterlaly start talking about their relationship issues DURING OPERATION. LIKE?????. But hey aside from that, Grey's anatomy is an often intricate character study which looks at human relationships in an imperfect but sort of beautiful way. Mostly good performances, and well paced seasons that do tend to suffer from tropes and repetitive episode structures. But within this repetitive formula lies an interesting episode which further challenges its characters and takes them through an almost naturalistic journey. Still.

0	Perfect for anybody, who never read the book. Missing very important parts from story, what is badly going sideway from the original, simple making everything chaotic and unclear... Many characters dies, who are actually very important part of the end of the (original) story. For this one, doesn't matter.The actors absolutely don't match with the characters, their plays and appears are just simple bad.Totally missing the relation between Toranaga and Blackthorne, what actually made the story interesting.

0	I had great hopes. I've watched Mr. Sanada acting in different movies and I admire his work. His performance in this one is very good, not his best in my opinion, but very good.Costumes are very nice too. I cannot speak about their authenticity though I don't remember seeing any obi on almost any female character. Not on this remake. I've seen it on all female characters on the 1980 original version.There aren't other good things I can write about it.I read this remake was well received and rated in Japan, compared with the original version which was not. I'm not Japanese and although I watched a lot of Japanese movies, not only the ones made for western viewers, and I read a lot about Japan and its culture, I think this version was made to target both, the eastern and western audiences. The team probably worked hard to do that and I think it shows. While the original version is somewhat cheesy, this one lacks almost any sentiment. It's like the Japanese part of the team had an argument with the western team every time they may have tried to do something to bring any soul to the story. I felt a tension throughout the whole series. It felt restrained and cold. I believe that may have been the intention, more so since they filmed it on rainy, cold, and dark days.The screenplay misses key points from the book, and most of the ones they didn't miss are minimized. I know, it's based on James Clavell's book, not quite loosely, but still, not what the author intended. That is sometimes not bad, that is when the book is not that great, just the idea behind it is. It's not the case with this novel. I don't expect for a team to follow the book exactly, but at least do an acceptable job, if they cannot do better. There really cases in which the movie is better than the book. Not in this case.I think Clavell knew a lot about Japan and its culture. To this point he writes about kissing which is not the way a samurai male or female was showing affection to his/her spouse or lover. In this movie the Blackthorne kissing Mariko scene is a fail. There are ways actors can show love even without touching, but I haven't seen any such scene in this new series. Almost all seppuku scenes in the movie are empty compared to the way they are portrayed in the novel. There is at least one which is better represented in the movie but which is not in the book. Toda Hiromatsu is never committing seppuku but the scene in the movie is very good.The screenplays for different episodes are written by different people and directed by different directors. This is why the whole story is missing unity. It's almost like threads that barely connect.I watched all episodes, some even twice. Overall it's not that bad but for me it was disappointing. I did not enjoy the original much at the time I've seen it in 1980. Not because I read the book previously. Even so, I like it better than this new one. I would not call this new one a remake.	great hop watch mr sanada act different movie admire work performance one good good opinion good costume nice speak authenticity though remember see obi almost female character remake see female character original version good thing write read remake well receive rat japan compare original version japanese although watch lot japanese movie one make western viewer read lot japan culture think version make target eastern western audience team probably work hard think show original version somewhat cheesy one lack almost sentiment like japanese part team argument western team every time may try something bring soul story feel tension throughout whole series feel restrain cold believe may intention since film rainy cold dark day screenplay miss key point book one miss minimize know base jam clavell book quite loosely still author intend sometimes bad book great idea behind case novel expect team follow book exactly least acceptable job well really case movie well book case think clavell know lot japan culture point write kiss way samurai male female show affection spouse lover movie blackthorne kiss mariko scene fail way actor show love even without touch see scene new series almost seppuku scene movie empty compare way portray novel least one well represent movie book toda hiromatsu never commit seppuku scene movie good screenplay different episode write different people direct different director whole story miss unity almost like thread barely connect watch episode even twice overall bad disappoint enjoy original much time see read book previously even like well new one would call new one remake

1	"Rewatching this legendary show is quite an experience. I would still recommend watching but, as another suggested, stop at season 6 episode 10 winds of winter and imagine your own ending - you'll be happier for it.Need a moment to debrief about all the injustices done to character development and story lines 1. The wolves who in the best seasons were used as perfect symbolism for house stark. Ghost, the only wolf remaining with the stark children, was abruptly given away by Jon in season 8?2. Cersei - the acting of this character was impeccable and the fact that she was made to drink wine and stare out a window for the last 2 seasons is a waste of a wonderful actress3. Still appalled by Bran's ""visions"" of Ned as a young lad. Cringe!4. The long night - I have no words5. ""No one has a better story than bran"". Actually everyone does. I did not read the books but I'm sure bran was not such a useless drag.6. There are so many more including danaerys who gave all the feels as khaleesi only to become a loony bimbo. Also Jon and yegriette are my favorite romance of the series . The character of Jon had great potential but instead was succumbed to a simple minded man repeating ""muh queen"" and ""I didn't want this"" over and over. SHAME.Still watch this show as season 1-4 are impeccable. It is an atrocity that this could have been next to breaking bad in being one of the greatest shows but instead turned into a ridiculous mess. I will never get over the sickening feeling about what could have been."	rewatche legendary show quite experience would still recommend watch another suggest stop season episode wind winter imagine end happy need moment debrief injustice do character development story line wolf good season use perfect symbolism house stark ghost wolf remain stark child abruptly give away jon season cersei act character impeccable fact make drink wine stare window last season waste wonderful actress still appal bran vision ned young lad cringe long night word one well story bran actually everyone read book sure bran useless drag many include danaerys give feel khaleesi become loony bimbo also jon yegriette favorite romance series character jon great potential instead succumb simple mind man repeat muh queen want shame still watch show season impeccable atrocity could next break bad one great show instead turn ridiculous mess never get sicken feel could

1	"I gave this show a chance after I saw multiple videos popping up on Youtube channels I watch occasionally claiming that the show was actually good. I didn't really watch through those videos as I didn't want to have the story spoiled and go in as unbiased as possible. My last Fallout game was Fallout 3 which was way over 10 years ago. So I have some experience with the source material but it's not recent.I watched through the first episode and was mildly entertained. The brutality and gore somewhat reflects what you see in the games as well with heads and limbs exploding or being severely injured. There's also several slow motion scenes similar to what the games do when you do the auto-aim functionality and target specific body parts.The world also looks like Fallout as far as I can tell. You have the post-apocalyptic wastelands with shabby settlements trying to survive. You have the raiders, brotherhood of steel and vaults. The outfits and backgrounds are accurate.The problems start when you look at the writing and characters though. A whole lot of it doesn't really make any sense and it only works if you as the viewer (as well as the characters) aren't actually asking very relevant questions. As soon as your mind starts working though and questions pop up about certain aspects the story completely falls apart. There are multiple factions and there are conflicts among them. Why these conflicts exist though - you'll get a shrug from me because I couldn't figure it out - especially in the last episode when the big showdown starts. The problem is also that way to many character in that one faction just go along with killing random people even though they are supposed to be kind of honorable and so on. It just doesn't make any sense.The season also has an open end leaving a lot of questions on the table for season 2. On one hand it can be good to have an overarching storyline throughout the seasons. On the other hand the ending of season 1 on its own is unsatisfying. So you either watch season 2 or you're left with a mess and that just doesn't deserve a high rating in my opinion.Finally something that also bothered me is that the pacing of the episodes was wildly jumping around. At times it slows to a snail pace with obvious filler content and then at other times it jumps around all over the place and a rapid pace. Especially in the last episode there was one character suddenly popping up in the middle of the battle zone and I was like ""wait, how did you get there unnoticed?"". It just feels off in many aspects resulting in sometimes being boring and then at others slightly overwhelmed with the events happening. There definitely is a lack of consistency here."	give show chance see multiple video pop youtube channel watch occasionally claim show actually good really watch video want story spoil go unbiased possible last fallout game fallout way year ago experience source material recent watch first episode mildly entertain brutality gore somewhat reflect see game well head limb explode severely injure also several slow motion scene similar game auto aim functionality target specific body part world also look like fallout far tell post apocalyptic wasteland shabby settlement try survive raider brotherhood steel vault outfit background accurate problem start look write character though whole lot really make sense work viewer well character actually ask relevant question soon mind start work though question pop certain aspect story completely fall apart multiple faction conflict among conflict exist though get shrug figure especially last episode big showdown start problem also way many character one faction go along kill random people even though suppose kind honorable make sense season also open end leave lot question table season one hand good overarch storyline throughout season hand end season unsatisfying either watch season leave mess deserve high rat opinion finally something also bother pace episode wildly jump around time slow snail pace obvious filler content time jump around place rapid pace especially last episode one character suddenly pop middle battle zone like wait get unnoticed feel many aspect result sometimes bear other slightly overwhelm event happen definitely lack consistency
1	"I'll lay my cards on the table here in that I was a fan from my childhood of the original. I'd expected this to be even better. And whilst it starts off being a faithful remake of the original, it soon descends into something less enjoyable.The original focused exclusively on John Blackthorns's viewpoint becoming immersed in a foreign alien culture and becoming gradually absorbed by it. This one does also but to a lesser degree. About 75% of the show is looking at the feuding between the various clans. And I dispose that's about right because after all the show is called Shogun and not John Blackthorne' Adventures in Japan.But this creates a pretty significant problem - for me at least. 95% of the show is subtitled. So you spend most of the time reading the subtitles and not the characters. Now normally I don't have a problem with subtitles for foreign films but for this I do.Then there's the lighting. Why are so many scenes set in such poorly lit indoor settings? And they're not restricted to just indoors.Then there's the weather. Does it never stop raining in Japan? Living in Ireland I've cursed our foul damp weather my whole life but we're effectively Saharan compared to these poor souls.Finally, there's the whole ""They all look the same"" problem. Now don't jump down my throat with this one. But the fact is that to Caucasians, who also all look the same to other ethnicities, trying to determine which character is which is so difficult especilaly when the lighting is so poor. Other filmmakers get around this by using different hair colour or style for each character to differentiate them one from another. Or dress them differently consistently. But with these characters, where the blokes all sport the same partial baldy hair and the same outfits, you spend so much time confused as to who is who. And since there are so many extras all looking the same, I found myself watching an extra thinking it was a lead character and vice versa. Maybe that's just a problem for an old timer like me.I think the only time the outfit colour is implemented is with John's love-interest. She's generally sporting a pale blue outfit. Dear love you if she ever wishes to experiment with different outfit choices.So, is it an easy watch? No. You have to seriously invest your time into persevering with the show past the first two episodes. In fact there's one episode around the middle of the show that I think the filmmakers had a chuckle putting it in. We're treated to a traditional Japanese play and ""musical performance"" with accompanying dancers. And it goes on forever with little relevance or benefit to the plot.It certainly has many good points but I think it's very overrated. I was close to choosing Seppuku myself."	lie card table fan childhood original expect even well whilst start faithful remake original soon descend something less enjoyable original focus exclusively john blackthorn viewpoint become immerse foreign alien culture become gradually absorb one also less degree show look feud various clan dispose right show call shogun john blackthorne adventure japan create pretty significant problem least show subtitle spend time read subtitle character normally problem subtitle foreign film light many scene set poorly light indoor setting restrict indoor weather never stop rain japan live ireland curse foul damp weather whole life effectively saharan compare poor soul finally whole look problem jump throat one fact caucasian also look ethnicity try determine character difficult especilaly light poor filmmaker get around use different hair colour style character differentiate one another dress differently consistently character bloke sport partial baldy hair outfit spend much time confuse since many extra look find watch extra think lead character vice versa maybe problem old timer like think time outfit colour implement john love interest generally sport pale blue outfit dear love ever wish experiment different outfit choice easy watch seriously invest time persevere show past first two episode fact one episode around middle show think filmmaker chuckle put treat traditional japanese play musical performance accompany dancer go forever little relevance benefit plot certainly many good point think overrate close choose seppuku
0	Grey's used to be my favorite show but now, I can't even watch it. For the past 4 seasons, it's lost its beauty with its cast and creativity. It's all about sex, politics and chit-chatting. Wheres is the medical drama that a MEDICAL DRAMA should have? They completely ruined relationships.

1	I've been binge-watching Grey's for the last few months and am now on Season 19. As the seasons have passed, the show has gotten progressively worse to where now in season 19, I find myself fast-forwarding through half of each episode. The propaganda is ridiculous. So much so, it's impossible to sit through. Was a great show up to about Season 10. I think it has less to do with actors leaving than the writers. I don't want to give examples because I don't want to give spoilers, but at times, there are characters whose storylines don't stay true to the character. Alex's departure was quite possibly the worst written episode in all of television. I hope they cancel it after Season 20. It's time.	binge watch grey last month season season pass show get progressively bad season find fast forward half episode propaganda ridiculous much impossible sit great show season think less actor leave writer want give example want give spoiler time character whose storyline stay true character alex departure quite possibly bad write episode television hope cancel season time

The actors do a commendable job with the script they were given. But the script and directing killed the show for me. I rarely knew what the character motivations were, what their goals were. The humor was not funny, it was scripted and childish. The pacing was VERY slow and seemed there only to connect ""events"" which were too cliche, imo.

I liked Wang Miao who is believable as a young world class scientist with a family.His role is split into 5 millennials of which only one is interesting. That would be Jin Cheng. The rest are dull and that Augie person just stinks. Can anyone believe that she is a world class physicist like Miao? C'mon man!!!The whole thing seems like a Cliff Note version. Shallow. Weak.

The casting is awful!!! Awful choices for all three! Why is Tom an old man? Alain Delon was perfect, Jude Law was perfect and even though I don't like her, Gwyneth Paltrow was fantastic as marg. These actors lack everything that the characters embody. Second is the filming to make it look like a 40's film noir. Just why? It literally just looks like a modern film turned b&w with a filter and white balance turned up way too high. 40's film noirs were dark and brooding atmospheric and this lacks all of that. And the acting does fit in with a 40's film noir at allll. Modern acting doesn't fit. It's a complete fail.	do wonderful story massive fan book first film adaptation plein soleil heck even matt damon version make weep start cast awful awful choice three tom old man alain delon perfect jude law perfect even though like gwyneth paltrow fantastic marg actor lack everything character embody second film make look like film noir literally look like modern film turn b w filter white balance turn way high film noir dark brood atmospheric lack act fit film noir allll modern act fit complete fail
1	I was late to the party and didn't really think the show was going to be very good. ABC unfortunately tends to push out PC and material that leans very left. Which again, all for if that's your entertainment but I like shows to take my mind off the left and right nonsense.Season one was great, very surprising. Season two had me hooked and was watching 2-3 eps a night. Buttttttt just like everyone says all good things must come to an end. Season three has taken a turn farrrrrr freaking left. I'm 6 eps in season three and it's pretty bad. Not sure if I can skip the whole season or just stop if this keeps up. Sad to see a good show feel like it needs to bring politics into a show with such magnitude.	late party really think show go good abc unfortunately tend push pc material lean leave entertainment like show take mind leave right nonsense season one great surprise season two hook watch eps night buttttttt like everyone say good thing must come end season three take turn farrrrrr freak leave ep season three pretty bad sure skip whole season stop keep sad see good show feel like need bring politic show magnitude
0	It's one of those shows that kept me watching until the last episode in the hopes that it gets better (somehow) or otherwise see how much worse it can get. Script and casting were the major fails here. The dialogues made an already ridiculous premise insufferable. Cringe-fest! Eye-rolls to the idea that a group of friends - all very, very young - were somehow the only ones qualified to save humanity from an alien invasion. Eiza Gonzalez was the most unconvincing Auggie (forever dolled up as if about to hit the runway) who was in turn the most unconvincing nanotech innovator. Actor Jess Hong as Jin had potential, but didn't quite get there. Saul was underutilised as a character - until suddenly propelled forward as one of the chosen ones, and for no apparent reason. Alex Sharpe is obviously talented but brought in a pathos and melancholy that seemed rather misplaced next to characters busy cooking up quick calculations and theorems to wage war with aliens as if they were in a YA fictional world. Benedict Wong was probably the only one who pulled off the character of a wry, world-weary detective/ security/body guard (it was never clear what his role was), so I hope he gets a shot at a better show/film in the future.

That being said, I'm married to a cop, and this is one of the few cop shows he can actually sit through and enjoy.

She is laughable in the things she says and the attitude she has, than any actual good point they could be making on the subject of policing and racism is lost.

1	The world of Fallout is a serious place. Life is cheap, and ends with alarming regularity. The first episode was a joy to watch, really enjoyed studying everything in the background. Incredibly faithful to the look and feel of the games, little easter eggs everywhere. Could have done a lot better on Power Armor, but can't have everything I suppose. Watched episode two, and almost shut it off. Fallout is not a slapstick world. I'll watch episode 3, but if it continues down this Disney Kiddie World I'll have to bail. It will pain me to do so, especially since my secret man-crush Walton Goggins brings it, but I can take only so much cornball humor.	world fallout serious place life cheap end alarm regularity first episode joy watch really enjoy study everything background incredibly faithful look feel game little easter egg everywhere could do lot well power armor everything suppose watch episode two almost shut fallout slapstick world watch episode continue disney kiddie world bail pain especially since secret man crush walton goggin bring take much cornball humor

If you can adapt GAME OF THRONES like that, why on earth would you make 3 BODY PROBLEM like this?? I can understand the simplification, but not to this childish level. The plot even seems like a soap opera, an urban drama. I can take the characters are not all Asian and of course diversed. But they're all simplified into these patterned figures, which I find very annoying. It seems like the team didn't even like the book, they just want to get this done. Somehow it feels like a disesteem to this amazing book. Because not only you show no understanding about the hidden eastern philosophy of the book, but also you show no patience to get the audience to understand the plot and the characters.

0	Against my natural antipathy towards post apocalyptic stuff, I was intrigued by a 5 star rating this series was given by Lucy Mangan in the Guardian.The plot was paper thin. It was so obvious what was going to happen and the level of insult to anyone with a brain was appalling!For example the Lucy Maclean stabbing survival was unbelievable. A stab in the gut is always serious and one should not remove the knife if it is still in the wound. This was followed by the even worse idea that her 'husband' came back to attack her.Equally stupid was the fact that her wrist mounted radiation as well as everyone else's did not go off the moment they met the people from Vault 32. It was clear radiation level awareness was high, but to fail to have automated alarms was, frankly, alarmingly moronic.I skipped forward a few scenes to the army camp and the arrival of the men in suits and immediately thought 'where was the airship built and where were the suits made?'. I had already been wondering about the construction of the vaults themselves, but the industrial level the airship & suits implied was far too farfetched.I could go on but I hope the foregoing gives you enough of the flavour of silliness which clearly is only going to get worse.My advice is avoid like the plague.	natural antipathy towards post apocalyptic stuff intrigue star rat series give lucy mangan guardian plot paper thin obvious go happen level insult anyone brain appal example lucy maclean stab survival unbelievable stab gut always serious one remove knife still wind follow even bad idea husband come back attack equally stupid fact wrist mount radiation well everyone else go moment meet people vault clear radiation level awareness high fail automate alarm frankly alarmingly moronic skip forward scene army camp arrival man suit immediately think airship build suit make already wonder construction vault industrial level airship suit imply far farfetche could go hope forego give enough flavour silliness clearly go get bad advice avoid like plague
2	Game of Thrones has established rules, travelling across Westeros is a multiple episode feat, but nah lets teleport them around whenever we need them to be somewhere. Maybe they've discovered all the locations now, hence the fast travel. Also motivations, is another facet that takes time and also decent writing to seem genuine and not forced.This episode, I feel was a bit better than the disaster that was Episode 4, but what's really holding this season back is honestly the writing. You've heard everyone talk about how it's rushed, and how plot elements have shifted dramatically to suit the end goals the writers have. It really is the case here. Daenerys' flip to a tyrant doesn't feel justified, and the past episodes this season haven't fleshed out this change well at all. She wasn't always a noble ruler, but making the choice to torch all of Kings Landing, just seems like a plot device to push the 'Targaryen Cycle', the writers want to use for some reason.Visually, this episode succeeds for the most part. The vast carnage going on is impressive for TV. It's clear the season was shortened to have grander episodes, with more demanding CGI sequences. I honestly felt we should have had more in between to help flesh out and build up to the decisions, made in these grander episodes. Plot convenience is also getting stronger as we etch towards the end, Drogon can apparently dodge, as well as wipe out all the ships and Balistas with ease, makes you think why he couldn't accomplish this last episode. I could go on and on with little things that make this an underwhelming climax to some long time plotlines we've become so invested with all these years.BTW the leaks for this episode were true, meaning the ending we're heading for does not look promising in the slightest.	game throne establish rule travel across westeros multiple episode feat nah let teleport around whenever need somewhere maybe discover location hence fast travel also motivation another facet take time also decent write seem genuine force episode feel bite well disaster episode really hold season back honestly write hear everyone talk rush plot element shift dramatically suit end goal writer really case daenerys flip tyrant feel justify past episode season flesh change well always noble ruler make choice torch king land seem like plot device push targaryen cycle writer want use reason visually episode succeed part vast carnage go impressive tv clear season shorten grander episode demand cgi sequence honestly feel help flesh build decision make grander episode plot convenience also get strong etch towards end drogon apparently dodge well wipe ship balista ease make think accomplish last episode could go little thing make underwhelme climax long time plotline become invest year btw leak episode true mean end head look promise slight
2	I am a huge fan of greys anatomy, but personally I think we all can agree that 19 seasons is way to much. To be honest, the downhill of the series was when Sandra Oh left the show. I cannot stand Shonda anymore. She is an incredible, talented woman, but why the hell is she always fighting with the actors and then killing their character??? It's so annoying. Like come on!

1	The alleged true story about the stalking of Richard Gadd who actually acts as the main character in the show but calls himself Donny Dunn.Its pretty brave of him to re-live and re-enact the torments he faced, the acting is good overall but there is no comedy or humor in the series, it starts dark and remains dark throughout.It is unique in that it presents the flaws and weird thought processes of both the stalker and the stalked. There are times I found myself blaming both of them for some the scenarios that followed, and maybe this is the whole point of the show, they are both as obsessed as each other.Towards the end of the series an episode mentions a viral video that finally shot Gadd into the limelight. I have searched and cant find the 'viral' video at all.To sum up the show I'd say its quite depressing and unsettling from the outset and then gets worse but still I had to watch it until the end to find out the significance of the title 'baby reindeer' I have scored it a 5 star because I am in the middle lane on this and cant decide whether to go higher or lower..	allege true story stalk richard gadd actually act main character show call donny dunn pretty brave live enact torment face act good overall comedy humor series start dark remain dark throughout unique present flaw weird think process stalker stalk time find blame scenario follow maybe whole point show obsess towards end series episode mention viral video finally shoot gadd limelight search can not find viral video sum show say quite depress unsettle outset get bad still watch end find significance title baby reindeer score star middle lane can not decide whether go higher low
2	Deviations from the book like, some minor name changes, time changes (Mariko has a child now), added characters (Yabu's nephew), small stuff, which add the run time and gives the story a bit more color. Nothing that would make James Cavell roll over in his grave (RIP).This version of Shogun, so far, gives us more insight into Toranaga's thought process, which you only get from the book and not the early version of Shogun. All for the better, in my opinion.Mariko shows real emotions. Blackthorne has the same grit and determination. LOVE how spineless and manipulative they make the regents!This is a much gritter looking version of Shogun. Much more like what I would envision for a city of 1600 Japan.The first 2 episodes have been such a delight and promising. I hope they keep up the pacing and storyline.	deviation book like minor name change time change mariko child add character yabu nephew small stuff add run time give story bite color nothing would make jam cavell roll grave rip version shogun far give we insight toranaga think process get book early version shogun well opinion mariko show real emotion blackthorne grit determination love spineless manipulative make regent much gritt look version shogun much like would envision city japan first episode delight promise hope keep pace storyline
2	This series disembodied the book. So if you're seeking a faithful adaptation that captures the book's essence you might prefer the Chinese version.Though armed with a higher production budget than the Chinese version, evident in the special effects, it comes at the cost of some plot details. In this retelling, there are more bodies to follow, too. In fact, this series adds 5 new characters who take on some of the roles originally filled by one character in the book. As I viewer I struggled to find them compelling enough or necessary. Maybe it is because I've read the book and seen enough of the Chinese version that makes me think that these writers had an opportunity to create a better adaptation. Overall, it is entertaining enough, but don't read the book before or if you have, keep an open mind.	series disembody book seek faithful adaptation capture book essence might prefer chinese version though arm high production budget chinese version evident special effect come cost plot detail retell body follow fact series add new character take role originally fill one character book viewer struggle find compel enough necessary maybe read book see enough chinese version make think writer opportunity create well adaptation overall entertain enough read book keep open mind

(The latter being easily the best in the franchise)It looks good, and some good actors, but the incessant changes just feel like pointless cultural appropriation.I'd rather play Fallout 76 than watch this again.Expecting this review to be deleted by Amazon owned IMDB...	shiny lightsaber thing look like thing make feel good matter break cannon lore even bad pace modern filmmake fine expect nearly good halo seriously world full amaze lore end cannon change pure spite wash away fallout fallout new vegas latter easily good franchise look good good actor incessant change feel like pointless cultural appropriation rather play fallout watch expect review delete amazon own imdb

2	Very pleased with this show so far. Seems to pay homage to the source material. And is beautiful to watch.Casting seems great, costumes superb, little SFX used also brilliant. Feudal Japanese seems incredibly realistic as much as it is complex. All the leads including the son are great actors. I wish I had read the book rather than watched the Richard Chamberlain series many moons ago. BUT so far, so excellent.Its probably gonna get some unfair comparisons to GoT but so what, yes its poltiical and yes its similar, but its just brilliant masterclass writing of West meets East with plenty of historical flair.I really hope you enjoy it as much as I am right now. X. And I hope I can read some material on any mistakes on the Japanese Feudal era as its quite captivating coming from a Westerners point of view.Nevertheless I am really enjoying this historical drama.	please show far seem pay homage source material beautiful watch cast seem great costume superb little sfx use also brilliant feudal japanese seem incredibly realistic much complex lead include son great actor wish read book rather watch richard chamberlain series many moon ago far excellent probably go to get unfair comparison get yes poltiical yes similar brilliant masterclass write west meet east plenty historical flair really hope enjoy much right x hope read material mistake japanese feudal era quite captivate come westerner point view nevertheless really enjoy historical drama
1	"It's a decent production and from what I remember seems to be faithful to the novel. However, this is clearly another attempt at Hollywood revisionist history. For starters it's filmed in Vancouver. You can tell that the buildings are sets. Within the first 20 minutes there is a samurai being dressed down by a woman. And of course, they had to find a dark-skinned Japanese woman to play Mariko. Interview with Anna Sawai.If you're thinking great, here we go, you'd be correct. Here are excerpts from the LA Times article ""Anna Sawai's 'Shogun' role felt personal: Mariko is 'every woman in Japan who has suffered"", FEB. 25, 2024""I wanted to know that they weren't just trying to do another white savior story,"" says Sawai. ""That they were going to do it right this time.""Her ""layer of contemporary attitude,"" as Marks calls it, is what enables audiences to see Mariko as a sympathetic character. It's rooted in Sawai's awareness of the various Hollywood tropes and misrepresentations that have plagued Japanese women onscreen for decades.""I didn't want it to be another depiction of Japanese women being sexualized by white men,"" says Sawai. ""I wanted this to be the right portrayal of women.""--Shogun was great because it was an accurate portrayal of feudal Japan. This may have been, if not for the attempt to modernize it. Which begs the question, if you're not creating your own production, with your own artistic interpretation, then why remake it? Why, indeed?"	decent production remember seem faithful novel however clearly another attempt hollywood revisionist history starter film vancouver tell build set within first minute samurai dress woman course find dark skin japanese woman play mariko interview anna sawai think great go correct excerpt la time article anna sawai shogun role feel personal mariko every woman japan suffer feb want know try another white savior story say sawai go right time layer contemporary attitude mark call enable audience see mariko sympathetic character root sawai awareness various hollywood trope misrepresentation plague japanese woman onscreen decade want another depiction japanese woman sexualize white man say sawai want right portrayal woman shogun great accurate portrayal feudal japan may attempt modernize beg question create production artistic interpretation remake indeed
1	Sure, this show has issues. I think the Foundation show on Apple TV is wayyyyy better. But this is fine enough. All these extremely negative reviews all sound exactly the same-so they're either echoing each other because they can't form their own opinions, or they're bots to tank the ratings. If I hadn't read the books I'd probably would have stopped watching, but that's mostly cause I don't watch a ton of shows so I can be rather picky. But as as adaption it's good enough. I really hope they get to do season 2, cause that's my favorite book of the series. Not sure how they're going to adapt book 3 cause dang if it doesn't get super sci-fi trippy.	sure show issue think foundation show apple tv wayyyyy well fine enough extremely negative review sound exactly either echo form opinion bot tank rat read book probably would stop watch mostly cause watch ton show rather picky adaption good enough really hope get season cause favorite book series sure go adapt book cause dang get sup sci fi trippy

0	The plot was so thin and the characters so gutted by bad writing in this season that I am not sure who even cares anymore about spoiler alerts. I thought it could only get better after episode 3 but episode 4 was even stupider.I don't usually do reviews but I have to vent somehow. I really was not expecting much in Season 8 in spite of the hype but the atrocious writing, thin to ridiculous plot lines and poor cinematography has managed to disappoint even my low expectations.The plot lines and characters have become so stupid they are almost unwatchable. I mean really? Daenerys is supposed to be the Super Queen? How many times can she walk like a dunce into a big Cersei trap and get all her men killed before most of them just say forget this I am not following this dunce anymore. She has now managed to stupidly get two of her dragons killed off, and by what bows and arrows!! Ha, ha, that's hilarious. Why not just fly around the boats and burn them up from behind? They can't shoot arrows through their own rigging and masts!! Not to mention there is no way arrows could ever destroy ships like that. Especially ridiculous arrows made out of iron!! They would be too heavy to even shoot, have a range of about 10 feet.I give up. It was just too stupid to even make any more omments about it.Sad, sad, sad stuff.Not sure I am going to even watch the last two episodes.	plot thin character gutte bad write season sure even care anymore spoiler alert think could get well episode episode even stupider usually review vent somehow really expect much season spite hype atrocious write thin ridiculous plot line poor cinematography manage disappoint even low expectation plot line character become stupid almost unwatchable mean really daenery suppose super queen many time walk like dunce big cersei trap get man kill say forget follow dunce anymore manage stupidly get two dragon kill bow arrow ha ha hilarious fly around boat burn behind shoot arrow rig mast mention way arrow could ever destroy ship like especially ridiculous arrow make iron would heavy even shoot range foot give stupid even make omment sad sad sad stuff sure go even watch last two episode
2	This show is up there with The Last of Us and Arcane as proof that video games CAN be adapted to TV shows successfully, as long as you treat the source material with respect.I don't know the games well enough to comment on the small details, but from what I do know of them, Jonathan Nolan and co have definitely got the world right. It feels very authentic to the games, capturing the awe every player feels on exiting the vault for the first time, on seeing the destruction of the wider world around the vault, on discovering the various settlements, on encountering the various weirdos around the Wasteland...taking the route of creating a wholly new story within the established world of Fallout was definitely the best creative decision they made here.The cast are incredible, too. From relative unknowns (to me, at least) like Aaron Moten (Maximus) and Moisés Arias (Norm MacLean), to better-knowns (to me, again) like Zach Cherry (Woody), Leslie Uggams (Betty), Sarita Choudhury (Moldaver), and Ella Purnell (Lucy MacLean), all the way up to the iconic Kyle MacLachlan (Hank MacLean) and Walton Goggins (The Ghoul), everyone is impeccably cast and each plays their role perfectly.The story itself is REALLY good, with the three distinct journeys - Lucy's, The Ghoul's, and Maximus' - being woven together brilliantly at times while also getting enough room to breathe and build on their own. I can't wait to see what this series has planned for the future. I only wish it was a couple of episodes longer.	show last we arcane proof video game adapt tv show successfully long treat source material respect know game well enough comment small detail know jonathan nolan co definitely get world right feel authentic game capture awe every player feel exit vault first time see destruction wide world around vault discover various settlement encounter various weirdo around wasteland take route create wholly new story within establish world fallout definitely well creative decision make cast incredible relative unknown least like aaron moten maximus mois arias norm maclean well known like zach cherry woody leslie uggams betty sarita choudhury moldaver ella purnell lucy maclean way iconic kyle maclachlan hank maclean walton goggin ghoul everyone impeccably cast play role perfectly story really good three distinct journey lucy ghoul maximus weave together brilliantly time also get enough room breathe build wait see series plan future wish couple episode long

0	Although all of the actors do a great job of portraying their respective characters, the storylines are boring and political. I read the news, I listen to the news, I am very well informed as to the state of this country. In my opinion, politics should stay OUT of ENTERTAINMENT and sports. We watch these shows and games to ESCAPE reality, NOT to wallow in it.	although actor great job portray respective character storyline bore political read news listen news well inform state country opinion politic stay entertainment sport watch show game escape reality wallow
1	Like the show & the cast. Except for Ellen Pompeo. She's too irritating. Amazing a show that is supposed to be centered around her is better without her. I'd rather watch scenes that don't include Meredith. Sandra Oh is brilliant as always... her character is driven, intelligent but yet very vulnerable. Love it. Katherine Heigl plays the perfect beautiful woman in a man's career who is usually overlooked because she is beautiful. She plays the character well. At first I didn't like Justin Chambers character but Dr. Karev has developed into a very interesting character & hope to see much more stories with him. I do like Patrick Dempsey's character. Dr. Sheppard is very sexy & entertaining. He seems to show charisma even when serious. Love the introduction after the first season of Kath Walsh. She's the woman you at first love to hate. In the second season she's become a well rounded character & fun to watch. Over all the series is good. I do think it could lose Ellen Pompeo & still be a great series. Truthfully of all the friends & family I know who watch regularly... NO one likes her.	like show cast except ellen pompeo irritate amaze show suppose center around well without rather watch scene include meredith sandra oh brilliant always character drive intelligent yet vulnerable love katherine heigl play perfect beautiful woman man career usually overlook beautiful play character well first like justin chamber character dr karev develop interest character hope see much story like patrick dempsey character dr sheppard sexy entertain seem show charisma even serious love introduction first season kath walsh woman first love hate second season become well round character fun watch series good think could lose ellen pompeo still great series truthfully friends family know watch regularly one like

2	"...this is not that.While it was certainly groundbreaking and a huge hit at the time, in retrospect great parts of it was rather cheasy and cheapish, and come on, none of us REALLY bought Richard Chamberlain as a rugged and battle hardened sea officer ;)The 2024 version feels a great deal more modern and budgeted bigger.It's rougher, it's dirtier, the action scenes are crafted much better, the camera work is much better and reminds you of a Hollywood blockbuster, the lighting and visuals are stunning to the point of being art, and they are underlined by sound effects and a score which amplifies the mood of every scene perfectly.The script is much richer and intricate than the original series, with better dialogue allowing the much enlarged gallery of characters more complexity and debth, which is especially important to American and European audiences, when depicting a very ""foreign"" culture... and it is all perfectly executed by a stellar cast, some of whom are getting their international breakthrough on this show.I just love it, it's probably not only the show of the year, but something we will constantly crave more of in years to come, and which competitors will try to copy.I should mention this is based off the first 6 episodes, so we are yet to see large scale battle scenes (but looking at the teaser clips, they look exellent), and we are yet to see the all important ending so I will reserve a possible 10 for then - but I am quite hopeful that is where it lands.It's a show that makes you annoyed it is a limited series, by nature of James Clavell having written only one novel on feudal Japan.. but I actually predict this will be such a big hit, that FX will attempt to have scripts written for either a prequal, continuation - or spin offs - because that period of Japanese history is ripe with potential - and come on, who doesn't like samurais?This is a must see show, even if you don't like samurais, even if you don't like period dramas, even if you don't like foreign language entertainment, even if you don't like subtitles - because if you don't watch it, you will be the person left out of the conversation, when the topic becomes entertainment.Enjoy :)"	certainly groundbreake huge hit time retrospect great part rather cheasy cheapish come none we really buy richard chamberlain rugged battle harden sea officer version feel great deal modern budget big rougher dirty action scene craft much well camera work much well remind hollywood blockbuster light visual stun point art underline sound effect score amplify mood every scene perfectly script much rich intricate original series well dialogue allow much enlarge gallery character complexity debth especially important american european audience depict foreign culture perfectly execute stellar cast get international breakthrough show love probably show year something constantly crave year come competitor try copy mention base first episode yet see large scale battle scene look teaser clip look exellent yet see important end reserve possible quite hopeful land show make annoy limit series nature jam clavell write one novel feudal japan actually predict big hit fx attempt script write either prequal continuation spin off period japanese history ripe potential come like samurais must see show even like samurais even like period drama even like foreign language entertainment even like subtitle watch person leave conversation topic become entertainment enjoy

1	"As a person who watched ""the talented Mr. Ripley"" with Jude Law and Matt Damon first and then this serie, I would say my review is not gonna be the same as the most of ones.For those who have not watched the movie yet, I would definitely recommend you to start the serie. It's really great, with just 8 episodes, easy to watch. The key of the serie is the cinematography and the black-white filter, gives another vibe to the serie and it's just brilliant, it's suit it perfectly. Netflix made a great work producing it, definitely It's one of the best serie that you gonna fine in Netflix.Personally I didn't enjoy the serie as much as I would like. The movie was much greater, not the way which is made, but the acting part of it. Jude Law was awesome, his body language and his acting way gave another tone to the movie. I can't say that Johnny Flynn had the same Era in the serie, he was much more calm and more serious, without any extraordinary acting skills. Same for Andrew Scott, Matt Damon was seem brilliant by the way of his acting, his movements, you could say that this guy has an IQ high as Noone else. Andre Scott was very simple, nothing special, his facial expressions weren't something that you could say wow what an acting. Personally I found it strange because I really love Andrew Scott and I follow his work for years, but in this one because of the movie didn't left me amazed.I know that maybe it's my fault and I compare them, but I can't act as I never watch the movie.."	person watch talente mr ripley jude law matt damon first serie would say review go to one watch movie yet would definitely recommend start serie really great episode easy watch key serie cinematography black white filter give another vibe serie brilliant suit perfectly netflix make great work produce definitely one good serie go to fine netflix personally enjoy serie much would like movie much great way make act part jude law awesome body language act way give another tone movie say johnny flynn era serie much calm serious without extraordinary act skill andrew scott matt damon seem brilliant way act movement could say guy iq high noone else andre scott simple nothing special facial expression something could say wow act personally find strange really love andrew scott follow work year one movie leave amaze know maybe fault compare act never watch movie
0	I am not sure where is the problem. Either Chinese storytelling is too different from Western storytelling or it is a bad adaptation of a great book, or the book is outright boring too (I didn't read it, and from what I have seen in this show, there is no chance I will). The show pace is very slow. It is supposed to be about an alien invasion, but there is little or no hint of the supposed aliens. Even the science is flawed, something I can stand if the storytelling is great (yeah, there is not such a thing like a Death Star, but who cares?...).This is the second recent show I have seen about an alien invasion with little or no aliens and a poor script. I hope it will improve. Writers should stop trying to do scripts for a very small subset of the viewers, and focus more on doing enjoyable shows.	sure problem either chinese storytelle different western storytelle bad adaptation great book book outright bore read see show chance show pace slow suppose alien invasion little hint suppose alien even science flaw something stand storytelle great yeah thing like death star care second recent show see alien invasion little alien poor script hope improve writer stop try script small subset viewer focus enjoyable show
0	I tried. Really I tried. I watched the first two episodes. I fell asleep in the middle of each one. That does not bode well for the compelling nature of the show.I can see that they've spent a huge amount of money on very complicated sets. It's certainly a lavish production.But I never played the game. I mean I could see where certain elements were obviously storyboarded right off of a video game. And the NPC nature of a number of characters is clear enough. But am I supposed to care about an NPC? I don't know if I really care about these characters. This girl this naive girl who has incestuous relations with her cousin, is this who I'm supposed to root for? And then this Cowboy ghost/zombie whatever, am I supposed to care about him? I don't identify with any of these characters. I don't care about any of these characters.Look it starts they've been in a bomb shelter a long time. Okay. Radiation bad. Okay. And they decide they're going to trade marriages with the adjacent Enclave. Okay. Everybody seems to have Geiger counters on their wrists yet when the door opens up to the adjacent Enclave no one checks. I mean in a world filled with radiation you would think that would be the number one thing you do when you open the door. This doesn't seem very smart. This doesn't make anyone in this Enclave seem intelligent. It makes them seem like idiots. And they die like idiots.Do they think I'm going to identify with idiots and root for them? If so they are sorely mistaken.And then this naive girl decides she's going to go out all alone in the big bad and I don't know find Lassie or her father or whatever.I really don't care.When I watched Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire's character was similarly naive. But he was also smart. He made some intelligent moves. He made some blunders and he learned from them but the character seemed to grow.In this show I have a real sense of here's character a. Here is character b. Character B will say something to character a. Character B will now leave. Character a will now go to character C and say something. And on and on it goes. Girl loses her eye. Is this necessary to the plot? Would the story be any different if she never lost the eye? Guy loses his foot. Is this necessary to the plot? With the story be any different if he never lost his foot? So why am I seeing this.Continuing the Spider-Man comparison, when Peter Parker made a bad selfish call, he paid with the life of his uncle ben. This made a difference to the character to the story. From there on in you see him consciously making efforts to make better choices.I didn't get a sense of that with this show.Here's a guy. He's going to steal a Iron Man suit from another guy. He can't fly it very well. The flying looks very much like a man on wires. At one point the CGI slipped and I actually saw the wires a little bit. That wasn't good. With all the money they spent on sets here I'm surprised they went cheap on the flying effects. Robert Downey did it very well in iron man. If you're not going to meet that standard then don't show him flying.There's a difference between playing a video game and watching a movie. Maybe you haven't noticed but your friends aren't terribly entertained by watching you play a video game. Making a movie which is essentially the same as watching someone play a video game is not a good path.Anyhow. Two episodes was enough for me. I won't be back.It's not a bad production. If anything it's quite lavish in terms of sets. But if you want characters emotions things to identify with, the normal elements of the successful show, you won't find that here.	try really try watch first two episode fall asleep middle one bode well compel nature show see spend huge amount money complicate set certainly lavish production never play game mean could see certain element obviously storyboarde right video game npc nature number character clear enough suppose care npc know really care character girl naive girl incestuous relation cousin suppose root cowboy ghost zombie whatever suppose care identify character care character look start bomb shelter long time okay radiation bad okay decide go trade marriage adjacent enclave okay everybody seem geiger counter wrist yet door open adjacent enclave one check mean world fill radiation would think would number one thing open door seem smart make anyone enclave seem intelligent make seem like idiot die like idiot think go identify idiot root sorely mistake naive girl decide go go alone big bad know find lassie father whatever really care watch spider man tobey maguire character similarly naive also smart make intelligent move make blunder learn character seem grow show real sense character character b character b say something character character b leave character go character c say something go girl lose eye necessary plot would story different never lose eye guy lose foot necessary plot story different never lose foot see continue spider man comparison peter parker make bad selfish call pay life uncle ben make difference character story see consciously make effort make well choice get sense show guy go steal iron man suit another guy fly well fly look much like man wire one point cgi slip actually see wire little bite good money spend set surprise go cheap fly effect robert downey well iron man go meet standard show fly difference play video game watch movie maybe notice friend terribly entertain watch play video game make movie essentially watch someone play video game good path anyhow two episode enough back bad production anything quite lavish term set want character emotion thing identify normal element successful show find
0	Firstly a confession - I hated this TV series so much that I only made it to the end of episode 6 before I gave up - I figured if I couldn't be won over in six hours it was probably never going to happen. Given this fact the reader should be aware that some amazing transformation may have taken place later which make this series far better than I am giving it credit for - though everyone I've spoken to who likes the series thought it was great from the start so I'm guessing the quality (or lack of it) is pretty consistent throughout. My objections? Firstly the writing is terrible - characters speak in this strange and special 'fantasy genre' dialogue which is stiff and comic (when it's not supposed to be) - the series looks cheap and nasty too - sets are often clearly studio bound with weak design, poor lighting and a strangely dated feel - it looks like a 1970/80s BBC Shakespeare production a lot of the time. The series also takes itself far too seriously - the whole thing has a portentous quality and apparently fails utterly to recognise its own silliness. I have absolutely nothing against the fantasy genre - the LOTR books and films are great - but this is a weak addition and I'd recommend avoiding it.	firstly confession hat tv series much make end episode give figure six hour probably never go happen give fact reader aware amaze transformation may take place later make series far well give credit though everyone speak like series think great start guess quality lack pretty consistent throughout objection firstly write terrible character speak strange special fantasy genre dialogue stiff comic suppose series look cheap nasty set often clearly studio bind weak design poor light strangely date feel look like bbc shakespeare production lot time series also take far seriously whole thing portentous quality apparently fail utterly recognise silliness absolutely nothing fantasy genre lotr book film great weak addition recommend avoid
2	Before I start this review, I have to say that I have never played a Fallout game, though I know the basic premise so I won't be judging my opinion of the show based on any of the games. Though I have now finished watching the Fallout TV Show and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a post apocalypse world after a nuclear war which sees people living in vaults underground to avoid the dangers of the surface.Main Character Ella Purnell plays Lucy McLean and she is fantastic in this show. Her character has a fantastic character development throughout and I just think she played up the role really well. She was a likeable character and somebody who was easy to root for in this show. There is a naivety to her as she interacts with other characters but it can come across as charming and gives her a way to develop.Supporting Characters Aaron Moten plays Maximus and he is decent in his role. It personally took me longer to care about his character then the others and I just think Moten didn't convey much emotion or reason to care about him. But that does mostly change midway through the show and Moten starts to grow into the role and add some more personality.Walton Goggins plays Cooper Howard/The Ghoul and he is tremendous in both versions of his character. We see Goggins as Cooper in his prime, before the nuclear war and it is interesting to see, especially compared to his undead bounty hunter persona in the modern day story. He is very charismatic and the fact that he has all this story about him does make him the most interesting part of the show and Goggins smashes it.Moises Arias plays Norm McLean and he is very good in the show and gets given his own story arc which is actually important for the overall show. He is mostly separate from the other main characters but he does an effective job and I grew to like his character more after the first episode.This has a big cast, that have smaller roles here and they are all great. This world is full of lively people and it feels like a vibrant world because of their performances whether they be on the surface or in the vaults, it was really effective.Story The story is great, as I said I have no idea about The Fallout story in the games but I became really invested in this shows plot and interested throughout. We see stories both on the wasteland and in the vaults and both are pretty captivating and do a good job of developing the characters. The flashbacks are good as well and are used effectively to give more context for the storytelling.Script The show is well written, it has moments of comedy in there but also plenty of dramatic moments that made me care. There are many twists and intrigue here and I think the writing did an effective job of showing this.Style Amazon clearly had high hopes for Fallout as you can see the massive budget used and the show looks fantastic. Both the wasteland and Vaults look so unique and fully encapsulate the tone of the show. Though, I think there were some issues, mainly the overuse of slow-mo in action scenes. I think slow-mo is a tool that can be used effectively but it has to be used carefully and this show definitely overuses it. I also know that country music is heavily involved with the games and it is well treated here but again it is just overused, especially during some of the action scenes that didn't require it.Overall Overall, the first season of Fallout was fantastic. It made me super interested in this universe and hyped for a potential second season. Even if you haven't played any of the games, this is still a show that should be watched because I think you will really enjoy it.Rating - 9/10.	start review say never play fallout game though know basic premise judge opinion show base game though finish watch fallout tv show review premise show see post apocalypse world nuclear war see people live vault underground avoid danger surface main character ella purnell play lucy mclean fantastic show character fantastic character development throughout think play role really well likeable character somebody easy root show naivety interact character come across charm give way develop support character aaron moten play maximus decent role personally take long care character other think moten convey much emotion reason care mostly change midway show moten start grow role add personality walton goggin play cooper howard ghoul tremendous version character see goggin cooper prime nuclear war interest see especially compare undead bounty hunter persona modern day story charismatic fact story make interest part show goggin smash moises arias play norm mclean good show get give story arc actually important overall show mostly separate main character effective job grow like character first episode big cast small role great world full lively people feel like vibrant world performance whether surface vault really effective story story great say idea fallout story game become really invest show plot interest throughout see story wasteland vault pretty captivate good job develop character flashback good well use effectively give context storytelling script show well write moment comedy also plenty dramatic moment make care many twist intrigue think write effective job show style amazon clearly high hop fallout see massive budget use show look fantastic wasteland vault look unique fully encapsulate tone show though think issue mainly overuse slow mo action scene think slow mo tool use effectively use carefully show definitely overuse also know country music heavily involve game well treat overuse especially action scene require overall overall first season fallout fantastic make super interest universe hype potential second season even play game still show watch think really enjoy rat
1	This show is entertaining for sure, but it can't seem to commit to many plotlines. Relationships and characters disappear very abruptly, sometimes without explanation. It's very frustrating to not see romances or storylines fulfilled.	show entertain sure seem commit many plotline relationship character disappear abruptly sometimes without explanation frustrate see romance storyline fulfil
0	Episode one was mildly interesting. Episode 2 was a cliché-ridden bore. It was as if the writers had a very short list of things that were going to take place during episode 2 and had to drag out the action sequences as much as possible to take up time. Lots of pointless gore and really dumb in-fight choices on the part of the protagonists. I'm familiar with the game - never played it myself but have watched others play it. Maybe if you like the game you'll like the series because you'll see references to it throughout the episodes. But, if you're not a fan of the game, and you actually read books with good stories, you'll probably hate this series, so I recommend you don't waste your time. Like most garbage being produced these days, this series telegraphs everything that's going to happen, because the writers seems to not have any original ideas of their own.	episode one mildly interest episode clich ride bore writer short list thing go take place episode drag action sequence much possible take time lot pointless gore really dumb fight choice part protagonist familiar game never play watch other play maybe like game like series see reference throughout episode fan game actually read book good story probably hate series recommend waste time like garbage produce day series telegraph everything go happen writer seem original idea

2	Hopeful season 5 will bring back what we loved about seasons 1 and 2, which they tried to recapture in s4. Yes, s3 was a clear departure into wokeville, but they still kept a lot of the heart of the show. I think they were testing to see how far it needed to go, which was unnecessary. This cop show does a great job of embracing diversity already from race and culture to neurodivergence. I understood they were trying to show that, yes, there are corrupt cops (and Brandon Routh plays such a good jerk that when he pops up on a show, I'm already booing him lol), but they ALSO showed most cops are in the job to help people and not ALL white men are the devil. Clearly, the show's frontrunner is one. Duh.So I kept watching through s4 and they returned to the basics of what makes this a great show. I adore Nathan Fillion, and I love how they appeal to a wide audience balancing action/procedure/cases/politico-socio drama with personal stories, danger, and relationships we can't help but invest in. I'd bring it up to a 9 if there weren't quite so many conveniences taken in the storylines that stretch way beyond reality. But overall, it's fun. I really hope they keep it that way with s5+.	hopeful season bring back love season try recapture yes clear departure wokeville still keep lot heart show think test see far need go unnecessary cop show great job embrace diversity already race culture neurodivergence understand try show yes corrupt cop brandon routh play good jerk pop show already boo lol also show cop job help people white man devil clearly show frontrunner one duh keep watch return basic make great show adore nathan fillion love appeal wide audience balance action procedure case politico socio drama personal story danger relationship help invest bring quite many convenience take storyline stretch way beyond reality overall fun really hope keep way
0	So the problem with the reviews is that almost all are people who played the video game. I did not and watched this as a stand alone series. It was so lame...such a cool idea as a story but had no substance at all. If you want to watch an underground bunker story, I recommend Cloverfield Lane.I literally turned it off after 16 minutes, so maybe I didn't give it a chance. But the acting sucked, the CGI was horrible. Why are they wearing matching suits anyway? And why are so many games being made into movies EXCEPT The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time? Which is definitely the best game of all time :)Give it a go if you are not a gamer, be forewarned this is a little lame.Edit: I got through 1.5 episodes. I thought all this hype surely meant it would be good. I would rather watch paint dry. Why anyone rates this above a 2, is beyond me. This show is absolutely awful in my personal opinion.	problem review almost people play video game watch stand alone series lame cool idea story substance want watch underground bunker story recommend cloverfield lane literally turn minute maybe give chance act suck cgi horrible wear match suit anyway many game make movie except legend zelda ocarina time definitely good game time give go gamer forewarn little lame edit get episode think hype surely mean would good would rather watch paint dry anyone rat beyond show absolutely awful personal opinion

1	"I'm not a fan of the game, but Uupon watching two episodes of ""Fallout,"" I was surprised to find it receiving such high praise in the IMBD ratings score. However, my experience thus far has left me underwhelmed. One of my main gripes with the series is its reliance on low-tech elements, which seems out of place in a science fiction setting. The technology, particularly the suits worn by the Knights, feels outdated and lacks the innovation one would expect. While the initial introduction of the Knights was impressive, it ultimately fell short of my expectations. I had hoped for a more captivating experience, but unfortunately, I found myself disappointed by the lackluster performance in these first two episodes. So far it's watchable I will watch the remaining episodes."	fan game uupon watch two episode fallout surprise find receive high praise imbd rat score however experience thus far leave underwhelme one main grip series reliance low tech element seem place science fiction set technology particularly suit wear knight feel outdated lack innovation one would expect initial introduction knight impressive ultimately fall short expectation hop captivate experience unfortunately find disappoint lackluster performance first two episode far watchable watch remain episode
0	Besides the numerous inconsistencies from the period of time which are disrespectful and fictional. The fact that the writers and directors decided to use Japanese and English but refer Portuguese as English was extremely confusing, I thought I had dubs on because it didn't make any sense. The show is either for Americans only or dumbed down, so many shows have 3/4 languages spoken and this show can't handle 2? And there are actors that do speak Portuguese? It became unwatchable after knowing that they only steered the series towards Americans. Terrible creative decision. Horrible boring series.	besides numerous inconsistency period time disrespectful fictional fact writer director decide use japanese english refer portuguese english extremely confuse think dub make sense show either americans dumbe many show language speak show handle actor speak portuguese become unwatchable know steer series towards americans terrible creative decision horrible bore series
2	I'm not usually into medical shows, but I enjoy Grey's Anatomy because of the characters and the soap-opera style story lines. I like finding out what characters are hooking up, breaking up, how relationships between them develop and how they deal with family situations. I also really enjoy the comedic writing on the show and Grey's has it in spades. I won't lie, it also doesn't hurt that there's some pretty good eye candy in the cast. Some of the acting is a bit shaky here and there, but there are some strong performances put on, especially by Sandra Oh as intern Cristina Yang. Even though, as I said earlier, I'm not usually into medical shows, I find myself almost intrigued by the medical aspect of the show.	usually medical show enjoy grey anatomy character soap opera style story line like find character hook break relationship develop deal family situation also really enjoy comedic write show grey spade lie also hurt pretty good eye candy cast act bite shaky strong performance put especially sandra oh intern cristina yang even though say early usually medical show find almost intrigue medical aspect show

0	The caliber of the production is far above average and from viewing point of view was a real treat visually To my mind the storyline wanders from the novel and is confusing. The confusion is due in large part to the use of captions In my opinion the biggest disappointment was the use captions on the Japanese dialogue. The captions turned off people. Considering the amount of money spent producing this series why wouldn't you give the viewer the option to select language as does Netflix on foreign.films. When it's possible to offer different language why would you not? Cast was excellent. All things considered, a lost effort.	caliber production far average view point view real treat visually mind storyline wander novel confuse confusion due large part use caption opinion big disappointment use caption japanese dialogue caption turn people consider amount money spend produce series give viewer option select language netflix foreign film possible offer different language would cast excellent thing consider lose effort
0	"It's a shame the show lost its writing staff. But hey, what a stroke of luck that a bus full of teenagers on the way to Magic Mountain were available to write this season.This episode puts the um? In dumb. If it wasn't bad enough that we were subjected to Tim's dumb evil twin, expecting us to buy that he has a girlfriend who looks like vata-from-the-hood Chen is a bridge too far...and the cringey ""we'd better practice kissing"" scene between the real Tim and Chen was just wrong on multiple levels.And the woke Hollywood B. S. has been staggeringly unrelentless this season. It's one thing that Hollywood is following the leftist agenda that citizens ought not be armed, but when they extend it to police, that's just stoopid. As bad guys are coming out of vehicles with automatic weapons, experience-hardened ""Rookie"" John Nolan's best strategy is to stand out in the open and call his girlfriend. When he finally gets around to thinking about trying to even the odds with weaponry, he finds out that the police station gun safe is inaccessible because, get this, ""the sheriff has the key."" How stoopid do the showrunners really think the viewing public is? Wait...don't answer that, this is Kalifornia...we know how stoopid the viewing public is. Also, the fact that the frequent gun fights on the show are now reduced to CGI flashes of light added in post-production, because Alec Baldwin screwed up one time in a hundred year history of safe simulated gunfights in Hollywood just seals the fact that this show is a pandering runaway train of woke idiocy.We've seen it before...shows that go on season break and never come back. If that were to happen to The Rookie, I would not be able to muster up a surprised look on my face. The music that plays towards the end of this episode starts with the words ""I do believe that I've had enough...""

0	"A commendable adaptation that manages to create a more atmospheric unfolding of the initial stages of the story than the Chinese version.The production is quite something, the visuals are dazzling, acting is solid... however, one can only call this intellectual & original sci-fi if one has never come across Stanislaw Lem, Ph. K. Dick, R. Silverberg, R. Bradbury etc.Rehashing age-old sci-fi ideas in a postmodern mix that can be entertaining, intriguing, and visually pleasing at the same time is not exactly 'intellectual' and certainly not original.There is a very sharp delimitation point in the series, around episode 5 - when the entire promising thing turns into absurd banality packed full of cliches.Spoiler alert... The pivotal moment of the aliens discovering what lies are and that humans can lie comes after decades of conversations and the deployment of a mind-probing virtual reality game that allows them to select a number of key people. And yet... this civilisation after such a long and deep interaction with the human mind does not realise that we lie... until... one person tells them in an audio conversation.From that moment onward, the tropes of ""we shall build a Moon base"" in, metaphorically speaking, minutes with current technology, the scheme of accelerating a payload with a human in it in a way that (to put it very, very mildly) would not be survived by a human body, and so on and so on become simply painful to watch.It is one thing to have a plot hole of the size of the Mariana Trench in the centre of the entire story, but it is another thing to violate basic science whilst claiming to be operating with the outer reaches of highly evolved science.Unfortunately, it is yet another series that not only doesn't adhere to very old sci-fi ideas that it regurgitates in a tarted-up form, but it cannot adhere even to the laws of elementary logic.And then we wonder why some who have not had previous contact with science fiction end up considering the entire genre as some brainless fantasy with no value."	commendable adaptation manage create atmospheric unfold initial stag story chinese version production quite something visual dazzle act solid however one call intellectual original sci fi one never come across stanislaw lem ph k dick r silverberg r bradbury etc rehash age old sci fi idea postmodern mix entertain intrigue visually please time exactly intellectual certainly original sharp delimitation point series around episode entire promise thing turn absurd banality pack full cliche spoiler alert pivotal moment alien discover lie human lie come decade conversation deployment mind probe virtual reality game allow select number key people yet civilisation long deep interaction human mind realise lie one person tell audio conversation moment onward trope shall build moon base metaphorically speak minute current technology scheme accelerate payload human way put mildly would survive human body become simply painful watch one thing plot hole size mariana trench centre entire story another thing violate basic science whilst claim operate outer reach highly evolve science unfortunately yet another series adhere old sci fi idea regurgitate tarte form adhere even law elementary logic wonder previous contact science fiction end consider entire genre brainless fantasy value

2	"The story is hilarious, somewhat thrilling, and full of suspense but left with one major flaw in the writing in favor of Ripley which makes it less compelling to my final impression. Cinematography is beautiful that goes hand in hand with Black & White. The film takes place in Italy and made it more visually delicious to watch. 8 Episodes format that covers all necessary elements for the story to end in a timely fashion: not too dragging, nor too short which i appreciate instead of cliffhangers for several more seasons like many other TV series out there. Tom Ripley actor is a perfect pathological liar that seems to be the center of everything. Other casts especially Italians complimented great suspense to the story which makes the film really enjoyable to watch. Overall, i give Ripley about 8/10 with 2 points deducted because of the writing of one key important scene and one important character: 1. Idiocy of Inspector that never asks the important question to Marge while he obviously skimmed through photos which included the photo of ""real"" Dickie just to later found out in the book as a comedic ending which i find it to be too on the nose. 2.

1	Game of thrones was one of my favourite series and was a solid 9 or 10 throughout seasons 1 to 7. I thought season 8 started well but then just nose dived in the last 2 episodes. What were they thinking? It's like they sat round a table with a list of endings and they decided to pick the lamest, blandest one. Where was the quality control? I was planning on watching the whole thing again once it had finished, but now, what's the point? When I know it ends so poorly. Unfortunately, it has tainted the whole thing for me, and takes it down to a 5. I won't be watching it again and will be selling my box sets. Massively disappointed. Watch Chernobyl instead. More shocking and REAL. And you don't have to take 2 weeks off work to watch it.	game throne one favourite series solid throughout season think season start well nose dive last episode think like sit round table list end decide pick lame bland one quality control plan watch whole thing finish point know end poorly unfortunately taint whole thing take watch sell box set massively disappoint watch chernobyl instead shock real take week work watch
0	"The execution is utterly lifeless, vapid, dull, surface-level, and lacking in a unique stylistic flair to distinguish itself amongst an over-stimulated world of mass-produced mediocre content that gets mindlessly promoted and quickly forgotten.It is sad to see another dull tv-show get overhyped by the masses, accumulating loads of popularity for no reason other than notoriety and big budget cinema ($20 million per episode ~ $160 million in total - which is absolutely abhorrent, that money could cure child poverty). Unfortunately this one never utilises its big budget in any meaningful or profound way.Wooden/one-note/mediocre/cheesy acting/Out of place ""comedy""/Too much melodrama when it wasn't the selling point of the show.Bland CGIThere are no audio-visual stylistic risks to hide the wooden acting and bland CGI.Presents it's thoughts on Astronomy/Science/The Fermi Paradox/The Dark Forest Hypothesis/Philosophy/The incompressible vastness of space in such simplistic and surface-level ways. You can learn a lot more about these topics from Fraser Cain, SciShow, Elderfox Documentaries, Anton Petrov, Cool Worlds, Dr Becky, Dreksler Astral, Geographics, etc... and to go beyond that Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Brian Cox, Frank Drake, Vera Rubin, Michio Kaku, etc...Loads of DEI that is deforming the perception of art, brainwashing people into accepting mediocrity in contemporary media, and ultimately encouraging conformity to the point where opinions in the minority are frowned upon because they don't meet a societal standard. A sensible way to actually embrace cultural diversity/variety is to travel, reflect, express gratitude, continuously improve yourself, find purpose, stay curious, and keep an open mind. Surely this is common sense? Instead what is currently happening is people are blindly accepting mediocrity because it aligns with an agenda, an agenda that is limiting the possibilities of art.Reading other reviews here is quite funny. The people hyping this up have probably seen < 100 films in their life, and < 5 tv-shows in their life, and they're probably hyping up mainstream dross like barbie, oppenheimer, lord of the rings, every batman film, every nolan film, every scorsese film, etc...If you want real profundity in the form of cinema, go watch Avalon, Serial Experiments Lain, Blame!, Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Patlabor 2, Steamboy, Stalker, Involution, instead. Genuine pieces of art that don't pander to the viewer and prioritise atmosphere/style/mood/detail/intimacy over plot and dialogue - unfortunately this will never appeal to the masses because it's easier to talk about plot than it is to talk about atmosphere/style/mood/detail/intimacy.Gradually, year-by-year, I find myself drifting farther and farther apart from mainstream cinema. This is another stepping stone to a personal appreciation for true artistic enlightenment.Disappointing and sadly forgettable. It's not unwatchable, but mostly a waste of time and money.

2	I was totally mesmerized by this magnificent production. It was different and better in my estimation then the movie version a talented Mr. Ripley! I thought the scenery. The fact that it was in black-and-white use of Italian actors and dialogue was very special.I was most impressed by the detective in the series. He was so matter-of-fact but yet very deliberate and very unyielding in his effort to find the murderers or murderer or missing person.But that really is the problem I have with the series and it is this detective who is looking for one and perhaps two people never looked for them with the help of a photograph . What detective looks for a missing person without a photograph? It for the end was certainly poetic license, but I believe it was a fatal flaw.Nevertheless, this series certainly deserves an 8 rating in my estimation!	totally mesmerize magnificent production different well estimation movie version talente mr ripley think scenery fact black white use italian actor dialogue special impress detective series matter fact yet deliberate unyielding effort find murderer murderer miss person really problem series detective look one perhaps two people never look help photograph detective look miss person without photograph end certainly poetic license believe fatal flaw nevertheless series certainly deserve rat estimation
1	I started watching this because i saw edits about cristina yang on youtube and i was immediately drawn to the show because of cristina's don't-carish, cold, funny attitude. So, obviously, i went to search who the actress was. Sandra oh. So then i went to watch the show. Honestly, the light of every episode is her. She made every episode nicer, more interesting and more funny. Sandra did an amazing, perfect job at acting her out with the way she said things. The show is interesting enough to watch, but honestly only until season 10. Cristina leaves in season 10 and the quality of the show drastically dropped. There was no spark anymore. So if you are watching grey's and are on any seasons before season 10, let me say this: if you are watching only for cristina yang, don't watch seasons 11-19. I mean- i only watch the episodes that have mention of cristina (yes there is) 14x07, 14x09, 14x19, 16x08, 16x09, 19x16 overall, grey's anatomy is a really good, interesting and nice show, but it has not been that good in the recent seasons. For me, seasons 1-4 and 10 were the best.Also anyone who wants to start watching now can i say that you will spend a lot of time on it. I spent 3 weeks watching 10 seasons and a few episodes of other seasons.	start watch see edit cristina yang youtube immediately draw show cristina carish cold funny attitude obviously go search actress sandra oh go watch show honestly light every episode make every episode nice interest funny sandra amaze perfect job act way say thing show interest enough watch honestly season cristina leave season quality show drastically drop spark anymore watch grey season season let say watch cristina yang watch season mean watch episode mention cristina yes x x x x x x overall grey anatomy really good interest nice show good recent season season well also anyone want start watch say spend lot time spend week watch season episode season
2	This historical drama is well made. I dont know if the budget is big but the production is very serious and has done a very precise depiction of the japaneese culture and customs at that time. What stands out the most to me is the cultural behaviour of that time that is very distinct and rigorous. Its actually at par with the story as the highpoint of this series.The acting is fenomenal. Everyone does an amazing job and its a real treat to watch the actors act out the japaneese culture.Camera and sound is hardly noticeable because the timing of everything is so good that you are so into what you watch that you dont notice the music.The diversity aspect have been heavily cut down, thankfully.. but they couldnt leave it all alone. The main character, the anjin(englishman) is half armenian, half english, but thats pretty much it.

But everyone falls in and out of love so fast now, the characters are basically regurgitated versions of past characters, and the plot most episodes is lacking.We also recently see doctors performing an abortion that doesn't seem to have much sensible reasoning behind it? One minute the baby is perfectly healthy, the next they are killing it?The show has taken a very dark and evil turn. It's sad that stuff like this is written and played in front of the masses and we are all expected to act like it's okay. It's not okay. It's truly shameful.	show use good remember love character storyline begin everyone fall love fast character basically regurgitate version past character plot episode lack also recently see doctor perform abortion seem much sensible reason behind one minute baby perfectly healthy next kill show take dark evil turn sad stuff like write play front mass expect act like okay okay truly shameful
0	The first two episodes of this show start strong and set up some interesting ideas, but past that point the show devolves into thoroughly dull character drama and some truly dreadful characters and acting with even worse writing and dialogue. Drawn out and boring, the show jumps from bizarre idea to bizarre idea and doesn't pay off any of them in anything resembling a satisfying or rewarding way, leaving only dissatisfaction and frustration after slogging through all 8 painful episodes. The show desperately tries to pretend to be smart but in reality is extraordinarily stupid and unjustifiably impressed with itself while being thoroughly mediocre. Not worth the time spent watching it.	first two episode show start strong set interest idea past point show devolve thoroughly dull character drama truly dreadful character act even bad write dialogue draw bore show jump bizarre idea bizarre idea pay anything resemble satisfy reward way leave dissatisfaction frustration slog painful episode show desperately try pretend smart reality extraordinarily stupid unjustifiably impress thoroughly mediocre worth time spend watch
2	I've played a few of the games this is based on and figured this production would go one of two ways. Thankfully, it went well.Firstly, for fans of the game, it's Easter Egg galore and very faithful to what I know of the game series. The series focuses on a handful of core characters with some worthy supporting roles for secondary characters which also feels very inkeeping with the game. As, too, is the violence... a lot of violence, which may be off-putting for some.The plot is game-level generic with some predictable twists and turns, but it works really well in this format; it's not a preachy story with bad attempts at political commentary or subtext - it's a straight-up post-apocolyptic survival story, where few people are good or bad, but a blur of both as they struggle to survive in a ruined wasteland.I recommend it to fans of the game and to people who broadly like the genre.	play game base figure production would go one two way thankfully go well firstly fan game easter egg galore faithful know game series series focus handful core character worthy support role secondary character also feel inkeepe game violence lot violence may put plot game level generic predictable twist turn work really well format preachy story bad attempt political commentary subtext straight post apocolyptic survival story people good bad blur struggle survive ruin wasteland recommend fan game people broadly like genre
0	The show is not worth the time you will spend watching it.The storytelling leaves you feeling confused, some concepts are introduced without setting any context, important things are happening to characters that have not been introduced properly, even after trying hard to care about what's going on in the series it feels impossible to do so because the characters are so superficial.Also, the casting choice is horrendous, some are well known actors who have done well in other movies/ shows but just don't fit in to their roles in this show.I haven't read the books so my opinion was not colored by how faithfully the book was adapted into the show. I found the show dreadfully unwatchable because of its own merits or should I say demerits.	show worth time spend watch storytelle leave feel confuse concept introduce without set context important thing happen character introduce properly even try hard care go series feel impossible character superficial also cast choice horrendous well know actor do well movie show fit role show read book opinion color faithfully book adapt show find show dreadfully unwatchable merit say demerit
2	Not a huge fan of the genre, but this show hooked me right from the start. Yes, lots of cliques like drinks at a bar after work, but I guess writers have to end episodes with a quieter setting, letting the audience unwind.Hopefully the quality of the show is maintained and they don't rely on too much character personal life, which is what spoils most crime shows for me.	huge fan genre show hook right start yes lot clique like drink bar work guess writer end episode quieter set let audience unwind hopefully quality show maintain rely much character personal life spoil crime show
0	This show could have gotten a high rating from me if not for those issues.First issue they speak Portugese in English. This is quite an issue as a Japanese who is learning Portugese is following an English conversation.... This is even hinted at from an early stage. I am English, but luckily for us all I am fluent in Portugese.The second issue is the style direction.Most of the times the backgrounds are blurred , this takes away the reality and as such my engagement. It often feels like most shots were made inside a studio.Japan is a very beautiful country so I think they missed a huge opportunity there.The minor issue is that the story is to convenient. The Macao incident is spoonfed to him while he is in prison. The fact that he is in prison is by chance and the person he meets there is by chance as well. He also was aware of Macao in some degree according to his diary. That as far as i watched hasnt been destroyed yet.There are more issues, he was just a navigator and he was picked without looking at any of the other sailors from the hull.This makes the entire story unbelievable and given the stylistic choice to blur the backgrounds this is more than a problem than it should be. I am constantly reminded this is just a cleverly written piece where everything falls together like a puzzle and not an account of what happened.I try not to use spoilers but I think I gave some. So this probably wont be read by anyone. If you read it, please rate it how you see fit. I think this was very close to being great but two choices were pretty bad.I finish episode 2. And unlike house of ninjas which also had plenty of issues i am not likely to finish this.	show could get high rat issue first issue speak portugese english quite issue japanese learn portugese follow english conversation even hint early stage english luckily we fluent portugese second issue style direction time background blur take away reality engagement often feel like shot make inside studio japan beautiful country think miss huge opportunity minor issue story convenient macao incident spoonfe prison fact prison chance person meet chance well also aware macao degree accord diary far watch have not destroy yet issue navigator pick without look sailor hull make entire story unbelievable give stylistic choice blur background problem constantly remind cleverly write piece everything fall together like puzzle account happen try use spoiler think give probably will not read anyone read please rate see fit think close great two choice pretty bad finish episode unlike house ninjas also plenty issue likely finish
1	As a rabid fan of the games, I am happy to report that this show absolutely nails the lore and essence of fallout, right down to the obligatory shallow main plot.In defense of the series, the lore of this world has always been the draw, rather than some big main quest. There is always a cheap excuse to get you out of the vault, then you forget about that reason for 100+ hours while you make your own story. So how do you make that experience into a good non-interactive story? Beats me, but I think they did it as well as could be expected.The good: -Goggins' standout performance as Howard -The interplay between Max and Chet -Lore building surrounding VaultTecThe bad: -Fights feel more comical than high-stakes -Main villain is dull -All the MacGuffins, -Generally boring/unlikable protagonists.	rabid fan game happy report show absolutely nail lore essence fallout right obligatory shallow main plot defense series lore world always draw rather big main quest always cheap excuse get vault forget reason hour make story make experience good non interactive story beat think well could expect good goggin standout performance howard interplay max chet lore build surround vaulttecthe bad fight feel comical high stake main villain dull macguffin generally bear unlikable protagonist

1	There are small parts of it that I liked. But very few. The pace is very uneven. All Japanese actors are fantastic and believable- doing the best with what they are given. There are two main issues. First - the writing is atrocious, formulaic, overly simplified and incoherent. The 2nd issue is the way Blackthorn character is written. He is neither the English gentleman nor the simpleton. Writers can't decide, and because of that his actions and words do not make sense most of the time and it is frustrating. Overall - overrated by about 3 points. Only 6/10 really. Watch 'The Last Samurai' Instead. A very similar story but well written, cohesive and overall a much better quality.	small part like pace uneven japanese actor fantastic believable good give two main issue first write atrocious formulaic overly simplify incoherent nd issue way blackthorn character write neither english gentleman simpleton writer decide action word make sense time frustrate overall overrate point really watch last samurai instead similar story well write cohesive overall much well quality

2	First of all, after three seasons, I really enjoy this show. It's got Nathan Fillion and a host of other likeable actors, and a decent story. It's fun, it's light and it always leaves me wanting more, as a good show should.That being said, the magic is constantly broken by their incessant need for female empowerment. As one character mentioned, women make up only about 12% of law enforcement and yet, in this show, they're over-represented to such an extent that one can't help but feel frustrated because they're always present, always right and always boring with their moral, intellectual and, often, physical superiority.Regardless of this issue, I do recommend this show to anyone looking for a bit of fun and distraction. I just wish they'd tone down the socio-political agenda to make it a bit more palatable.	first three season really enjoy show get nathan fillion host likeable actor decent story fun light always leave want good show say magic constantly break incessant need female empowerment one character mention woman make law enforcement yet show represent extent one help feel frustrate always present always right always bear moral intellectual often physical superiority regardless issue recommend show anyone look bite fun distraction wish tone socio political agenda make bite palatable
0	"Some of the special effects are terrible, like the ship crashing. If you're going to slice people in half, go the extra mile and make it look believable. The storyline is interesting, but why make a shaky premise worse by hiring terrible actors to deliver the goods? Liam Cunningham, Jonathan Pryce, and Rosalind Chow know what they're doing, but the rest of the actors are awful. Who decided that Benedict Wong should be an actor? Or Eiza Gonzalez? Or Jovan Adepo? These actors are so unconvincing that I really don't care what happens to them. Also, since this is Netflix, only the young women characters are allowed to be geniuses, no middle aged men allowed because of the ""patriarchy"". Seriously, a twenty-something girl is the head of a research project probably costing somewhere in the millions of dollars. That's believable.Also, I find it hard to believe that an advanced civilization capable of interstellar travel and possessing knowledge beyond human comprehension is unable to find a more accommodating planet to travel to."	special effect terrible like ship crash go slice people half go extra mile make look believable storyline interest make shaky premise bad hire terrible actor deliver good liam cunningham jonathan pryce rosalind chow know rest actor awful decide benedict wong actor eiza gonzalez jovan adepo actor unconvince really care happen also since netflix young woman character allow genius middle age man allow patriarchy seriously twenty something girl head research project probably cost somewhere million dollar believable also find hard believe advance civilization capable interstellar travel possess knowledge beyond human comprehension unable find accommodate planet travel
0	I am a huge fan of the 1983 mini series with Richard Chamberlain. He absolutely was John Blackthorrne. This FX series cannot begin to compare. It is tedious to watch. I am just an hour in and am giving up. If I want to read that much, I will read the book. This version seems to augment violence for violence's sake. Catholic bashing too which never sits well. They seemed to make a strong point of that early on. Volume is incredibly low, many scenes seen overly dark. Not as sumptuous as the original. I had this set as a series recording and deleted it after an hour in. It is rare that I ever like a remake. I think the only one that comes to mind was the A-Team movie. I spent most of the hour I watched not being able to truly concentrate because I had to read so much. I normally do not mind subtitles but this was painful. No thanks. I will now go buy the original.	huge fan mini series richard chamberlain absolutely john blackthorrne fx series begin compare tedious watch hour give want read much read book version seem augment violence violence sake catholic bash never sit well seem make strong point early volume incredibly low many scene see overly dark sumptuous original set series record delete hour rare ever like remake think one come mind team movie spend hour watch able truly concentrate read much normally mind subtitle painful thank go buy original
0	First of all, I know I'm biased because I'm Portuguese, but in a show of this level hearing in Japanese that the next discussion would be in Portuguese and immediately the conversation is in English is simply a huge flaw for me. I really appreciate you putting on a show of this quality and dimension where Portugal is mentioned, and I obviously realize that for most people the dialogue that was supposed to be in Portuguese is actually in English, which makes no difference and only helps the show to flow and grow. However, it's still quite difficult for me to accept this fact. However, I will try to continue watching the show and try to ignore this (which I believe will be quite an impossible task). I hope no one is offended by this comment. Have a good day/night everyone. Thank you!	first know bias portuguese show level hear japanese next discussion would portuguese immediately conversation english simply huge flaw really appreciate put show quality dimension portugal mention obviously realize people dialogue suppose portuguese actually english make difference help show flow grow however still quite difficult accept fact however try continue watch show try ignore believe quite impossible task hope one offend comment good day night everyone thank

Great cinematography, sure, but that's because of the huge budget. The writing, on the other hand...Anyways, I was convinced that the writers would learn from their mistakes and give us a flawless season 7, on account of there being less episodes. I was wrong again. The writing was... catastrophic. Yet I still found myself enjoying the action scenes, once my brain was turned off.I told myself ""You know what, it can't possibly get any worse... right ?""Well... I was wrong. Not only is the last season almost ingeniously bad, it also destroyed all the build up from the first seasons.At least now I know it won't get worse than that.

0	"This production is, in a word, dull. Just so dull. I do not like to use the word ""boring"" to criticize films, because I do not want to give the impression that I need movies to thrill me with scene after scene of snappy dialogue or car chases or shocking twists. But please, let's not let our film be dull. The production suffers from major missteps on several levels. First, the casting of Ripley is wrong. Let me say that Andrew Scott is one of The Most Brilliant Actors working in cinema and on stage today, but he is just (I think) too old for this part. Isn't Tom Ripley supposed to a contemporary of Dickie Greenleaf? (I haven't read the books, but I have always had the impression that they were close to each other in age.) His Ripley is so restrained. So grave. Which leads me to the next issue: the pacing of the film is so slow, it's downright lethargic. This wouldn't be a problem if there were any kind of energy or chemistry between the main characters, any kind of crackle to their interactions. But there just isn't. For someone who looks with such envious eyes on the privileged world that Greenleaf inhabits, Ripley does not seem to possess any refinement or worldly intelligence. His tastes are gauche. For me, this makes it a stretch to see him pulling off his schemes, petty though many of them are. The cinematography, though crisp and beautiful in black and white, adds to the rather sterile and soulless feel of the production. The one element of direction that I did find somewhat compelling was the use of gazes. Ripley gazing at Dickie's ring, for example. The postman looking at Ripley after he has asked an indiscreet question. Marge noticing Ripley covet Dickie's ring. Then there's the cat. (ha) I made it through the first three episodes, and I just don't care to continue."	production word dull dull like use word bore criticize film want give impression need movie thrill scene scene snappy dialogue car chase shock twist please let let film dull production suffer major misstep several level first cast ripley wrong let say andrew scott one brilliant actor work cinema stage today think old part tom ripley suppose contemporary dickie greenleaf read book always impression close age ripley restrain grave lead next issue pace film slow downright lethargic problem kind energy chemistry main character kind crackle interaction someone look envious eye privilege world greenleaf inhabit ripley seem possess refinement worldly intelligence taste gauche make stretch see pull scheme petty though many cinematography though crisp beautiful black white add rather sterile soulless feel production one element direction find somewhat compel use gaze ripley gaze dickie ring example postman look ripley ask indiscreet question marge notice ripley covet dickie ring cat ha make first three episode care continue
1	I started watching this show not so long ago. The reason was that I fell in love with House and wanted something of the same type. From the early first season I understood that this show is not even close to what I wanted but still, I liked the atmosphere, jokes, some of the actors. So I watched this show evenings while cooking with a strong belief that I won't spend a night in front of the TV. Cause it was nice but not good enough to freeze me in temptation.I am not ready to draw an exact border, but from some point, the show started getting worse and worse with every single episode. Good characters kept dying, the level of play of the new ones kept falling down and the plot kept moving to a straight line of consequent troubles for the characters that are still alive.At first I was just skipping the scenes with characters I find dumb and unexciting to follow. Once I even watched 3 episodes in an hour, but from the 12th season I understood that I started skipping the dominant part. That's why I don't see the reason to continue watching this show.I would recommend watching the first 2-3 seasons and then stopping as if there was nothing further.	start watch show long ago reason fall love house want something type early first season understand show even close want still like atmosphere joke actor watch show even cook strong belief spend night front tv cause nice good enough freeze temptation ready draw exact border point show start get worse bad every single episode good character keep die level play new one keep fall plot keep move straight line consequent trouble character still alive first skip scene character find dumb unexciting follow even watch episode hour th season understand start skip dominant part see reason continue watch show would recommend watch first season stop nothing
0	Ripley is clearly one of the most beautifully filmed B&W films, the sharp images, cinematography, lingering images and period settings are incredible. That's the positive which avoids a 1 star.Also being positive this version is closer to the book which portrays Ripley as a manipulative, controlling con artists which was lost in Matt Damon's character who was far more opportunistic.The rest , I don't where to start.Andrew Scott is just plan creepy, Dickie would have thrown him out after 10 minutes. Dickie is needy and there's no bond between the characters to indicate why he would invite Ripley to stay , other than them both being American.Dickie seems depressed and clearly not enjoying life in Italy, he would actually be happier in New York. He doesn't smile once in the whole film.The acting is stilted, dead pan from the rest of the cast ...just going through the motions. Marge is a zombie and I may be 55 but what the heck has Freddie become other than a PC icon.Not sure why they even went to San Remo other than to set up a murder.All in all watch the first episode for the gloss and sack the rest of it.Then watch the complex characters you can identify with, the high life , the drama , the colour of the film and enjoy it. I would have loved Minghella to have lived long enough to have the opportunity to explore the characters more in the form of a series of episodes.	ripley clearly one beautifully film b w film sharp image cinematography linger image period setting incredible positive avoid star also positive version close book portray ripley manipulative control con artist lose matt damon character far opportunistic rest start andrew scott plan creepy dickie would throw minute dickie needy bond character indicate would invite ripley stay american dickie seem depress clearly enjoy life italy would actually happy new york smile whole film act stilte dead pan rest cast go motion marge zombie may heck freddie become pc icon sure even go san remo set murder watch first episode gloss sack rest watch complex character identify high life drama colour film enjoy would love minghella live long enough opportunity explore character form series episode
2	The notion of a 45 year old man joining the LAPD as a rookie shouldn't work but good writing and a great cast makes all the difference. Nathan Fillion as the titular character has a likeability factor not unlike Jimmy Stewart or James Garner that helps make his earnestness believable. The story focuses on three rookies who went through the academy together and their training officers. The cast is great and the writing gives them much to work with. Each episode will go from humorous to nerve racking to tragic and makes it all believable.	notion year old man join lapd rookie work good write great cast make difference nathan fillion titular character likeability factor unlike jimmy stewart jam garner help make earnestness believable story focus three rookie go academy together train officer cast great write give much work episode go humorous nerve rack tragic make believable

1	I started watching this show when I was in Medical school. As a 40+ yo (went late in life) I loved this and House. Watched until last season as it just became unbearably preachy. If you want to watch the show then start with Season 1 and be prepared for it to be great through about season 5 or 6. When some of the originals start to leave it starts to be less interesting. Sad thing is I have liked alot of the characters over the years but Shonda has started to get too preachy (in her other shows as well). At this point I pretty much cant watch anything she makes which is sad because I liked her earlier work....	start watch show medical school yo go late life love house watch last season become unbearably preachy want watch show start season prepare great season original start leave start less interest sad thing like alot character year shonda start get preachy show well point pretty much can not watch anything make sad like early work
1	What used to be a great drama that brought you into the world of surgery that gave you characters you liked, rooted for, turned into a woke, agenda based, soap cliché. Where the medical drama aspect was the focus is now not even a factor. Now surgeries are a chance to play the newest pop song and blast through it. I hate the new interns and residents they dont have the charm or personality. They are stock characters to fill in their quota. I heard Meredith was leaving & it's safe to say where it started with her this show should've ended with her. I can say the last 4-5 seasons have been the worst & dragged this show to bottom. In the beginning this show was 10/10 for me. But now the last few seasons have dragged this down to a sad 5/10 I haven't looked forward to an episode in a long time. What was entertainment is now a chore.	use great drama bring world surgery give character like root turn wake agenda base soap clich medical drama aspect focus even factor surgery chance play new pop song blast hate new intern resident do not charm personality stock character fill quota hear meredith leave safe say start show end say last season bad drag show bottom begin show last season drag sad look forward episode long time entertainment chore
0	I have no idea why this show is getting great reviews. The writing is like nails on a chalkboard. The dialogue doesn't flow. It seems needlessly wordy, like they're trying to make such huge points. But interactions can't be powerful if *every* interaction is trying to be powerful. It looks like actors reciting lines rather than genuine, believable relationships.The main character has an internal monologue and it's so cringy. It reminds me of the flowery language of a high school poetry class. The camera always does tight shots on the guy's face, many per episode. I get that it's to show he's thinking deeply about whatever it is, but it is so heavy handed. They couldn't come up with another device to show his emotional struggle?It was boring and felt amateurish. Yet another show trying to be edgy by covering 'shocking' topics and failing in skill and substance à la Saltburn.	idea show get great review write like nail chalkboard dialogue flow seem needlessly wordy like try make huge point interaction powerful every interaction try powerful look like actor recite line rather genuine believable relationship main character internal monologue cringy remind flowery language high school poetry class camera always tight shot guy face many per episode get show think deeply whatever heavy hand come another device show emotional struggle bore feel amateurish yet another show try edgy cover shock topic fail skill substance la saltburn
2	"1st episode opens with ""This is a true story,"" and the series starts off with what you think will be a run of the mill stalking story, but it goes so much deeper than that. In the first few episodes, you find yourself extremely frustrated with the main character, and some of the decisions he makes, but as the series moves on, it really sheds incredible insight, and truly explains his decisions and thoughts that earlier had you screaming at the TV at him, maybe like me you screamed at him and calling him, ""an idiot!"" I watched the whole series in one day, and it definitely did not ever drag on, it deals with some Very disturbing content so if you are really sensitive to things that causes people major trauma, viewer beware. They don't Show anything graphic in nature like violence or anything of that sort, but the implications are and Richard Gadd's performance truly captured the raw emotion of the trauma that is a result of everything that he goes through.

0	"A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of fast-paced fantasy epics by novelist George R.R. Martin. With a total of 4,451 pages so far, it took me a little over a month to read. It's an exciting parade of plot twists and prophecies, and explores a rich secondary world with all its cultures and history through the points of view of a diverse cast of characters.""Game of Thrones"" is an HBO television series based on those books. It has lasted six seasons so far, and each one feels like an eternity. It is pedantic, talkative, static, and predictable. The progress of its narrative mirrors the structure of its opening theme music: circular, monotonous, and endlessly repetitive. Its plot twists take the form of stabbings, beheadings, and betrayals, but for all their apparent randomness they arrive at regular intervals -- when things are going well for a character, you know his throat will be slit by the end of the episode.The novels were told from the points of view of its main characters, and its perspective broadened with each book, illuminating new corners of the world of Westeros and shedding new light on what's gone before. Reading the books is an experience of ongoing revelation. We gradually come to understand the story's villains, and that understanding engenders our sympathy. The show is more direct. Everything is laid bare, and the characters are transformed into cogs in the convoluted machinery of the plot. The net result is that none of the characters are truly sympathetic; we can only watch the show objectively, without really caring about what happens to anyone. All men must die, and all GoT characters will commit terrible deeds for selfish ends.Stylistically, the show is bewilderingly dull. When the tension should be ratcheting up, Tyrion and his brother Jaime pause for a conversation about their mentally challenged cousin. Littlefinger and Varys, the show's resident Machiavellian schemers, regularly deliver expository speeches. Other characters proclaim their motives out loud, while still others happily announce things that everyone should already know. It creates the singular impression that the scripts are ninety percent filler. The gears of the plot keep inexorably turning, and the writers struggle to keep up."	song ice fire series fast pace fantasy epic novelist george r r martin total page far take little month read excite parade plot twist prophecy explore rich secondary world culture history point view diverse cast character game throne hbo television series base book last six season far one feel like eternity pedantic talkative static predictable progress narrative mirror structure open theme music circular monotonous endlessly repetitive plot twist take form stabbing behead betrayal apparent randomness arrive regular interval thing go well character know throat slit end episode novel tell point view main character perspective broaden book illuminate new corner world westeros shed new light go read book experience ongoing revelation gradually come understand story villain understand engender sympathy show direct everything lie bare character transform cog convolute machinery plot net result none character truly sympathetic watch show objectively without really care happen anyone man must die get character commit terrible deed selfish end stylistically show bewilderingly dull tension ratchet tyrion brother jaime pause conversation mentally challenge cousin littlefinger vary show resident machiavellian schemer regularly deliver expository speech character proclaim motive loud still other happily announce thing everyone already know create singular impression script ninety percent filler gear plot keep inexorably turn writer struggle keep
1	This just wasn't my cup of tea. I'm not going to spoil anything but this guy just makes bad decision after bad decision and it's hard to watch. As a film, it's oddly boring at times despite the plot line. Half hour episodes sometimes feel like hours. I know people are giving this good reviews, but if you don't like troubled lives with drawn out story telling, pass on this.I suppose the only unique thing this has to offer is that the actor is the actual real life Donny. So it may draw you in for that reason, but I just didn't care whatsoever. I kept wanting to shout WHAT ARE YOU DOING??!!! And keep in mind despite Martha being a central figure in this show, his bad decisions go well beyond and with others. Intrigued? Try it. But don't say I didn't warn you that it's irritating more than entertaining.	cup tea go spoil anything guy make bad decision bad decision hard watch film oddly bear time despite plot line half hour episode sometimes feel like hour know people give good review like trouble live draw story tell pass suppose unique thing offer actor actual real life donny may draw reason care whatsoever keep want shout keep mind despite martha central figure show bad decision go well beyond other intrigue try say warn irritate entertain

2	"I started watching this show because I was curious about the game - which I've never played - and also because it has a good rating.Well, the first season is done and I finished watching it in two days. It's that interesting. The plot twists and story keep you hooked from the get-go, and the character arcs keep you guessing what our heroes will do next.For example, ""the ghoul"" starts off as a cool dude, then does some shady ""surfies"" stuff, and then slowly becomes an anti-hero figure. Of all the characters, he is probably my favorite because of his complete lack of correctness.There is a romantic side to the story, which I don't much care for, but I guess you can't have your cake and eat it, too.Definitely looking forward to season 2.

2	I have never watched anything in full black-and-white before, so at first I was a bit not into it, but as the show goes on, I think it's an interesting artistic choice. It added a layer of grit and atmosphere, giving a shadowy noir tone to the story. The visuals are a gorgeous play in shadow and light.Now, the pacing is somewhat slow. While it's clearly intentional and may appeal to some, it's not really my thing.The casts and the supporting casts all did an amazing job. The production and the location setups are also amazing. The plot of the show is a nice thrilling mix of mystery and suspense.	never watch anything full black white first bite show go think interest artistic choice add layer grit atmosphere give shadowy noir tone story visual gorgeous play shadow light pace somewhat slow clearly intentional may appeal really thing cast support cast amaze job production location setup also amaze plot show nice thrill mix mystery suspense

An ending so bad, it ruins the rewatchability of the show. Let me start off by saying, I was as big of a fan of the show and the books as you could possibly be. I finished the books in 2012, and since have reread most of them. I have watched season 1-6 more times than I even feel comfortable admitting. I wanted to pour my disappointment into a beautifully written polemic, but instead, I am going to put as much effort into the rest of this review as Benioff and Weiss did into the final season:Stupid story, arcs ruined, plots abandoned, rush rush rush, every character takes stupid pills, okay let's wrap this up already, fight fight, cgi, okay we're done.

I cant remember any of their names, and all their problems seem so trivial, and they completely ignore the one problem that actually seems important. Theyre stereotypes of 'the genius scientist' like the guy who constantly says things like ""its a deepfake"" as if a scientist would ever believe someone could deepfake the STARS BLINKING GLOBALLY.

0	"On the technical level, its just fine. The effects and CG aren't anything to write home about, the gore is as excessive as it ought to be considering the source material, and most of the visuals are OK. Decent. That said, as far as the source material goes, it's utterly creatively bankrupt and completely uninspired. It's taken every little prop from the game (Fallout 4, seemingly the only entry in the franchise they seem to care much about despite being located on the opposite end of the country geographically) and brought it into the show, which at first was fun to see, but QUICKLY got old. The visuals can be summarized as ""Fallout 4 but a show."" Todd Howard is an absolutely talentless hack.The casting is bad. Walton Goggins has a good performance and plays the only redeeming character with any depth. The actors chosen for many of the vault dwellers are at times viscerally unpleasant to watch, with no payoff to their awful personalities and bizarre decision making. The lead actress is unremarkable and bland, and somehow manages to both be pitiful and a Mary Sue at the same time.Honestly I regret watching this, and have already thrown in the towel with Amazon Prime as a whole because of the shallow garbage they've been putting out lately."	technical level fine effect cg anything write home gore excessive ought consider source material visual ok decent say far source material go utterly creatively bankrupt completely uninspired take every little prop game fallout seemingly entry franchise seem care much despite locate opposite end country geographically bring show first fun see quickly get old visual summarize fallout show todd howard absolutely talentless hack cast bad walton goggin good performance play redeem character depth actor choose many vault dweller time viscerally unpleasant watch payoff awful personality bizarre decision make lead actress unremarkable bland somehow manage pitiful mary sue time honestly regret watch already throw towel amazon prime whole shallow garbage put lately

None of the major characters look or feel like a scientist... they seem not to care about things that were not making sense... just spend days hanging out with friends in a bar. It is so obvious that none of them actually care about science. Apparently, the writers are better at writing three body love triangles than three body physics problems.it is both awful adaption /writing and awful casting. I bet none of them spend enough time understanding basic physics..It feels another cool kids save the world type of show. Don't waste your time.

It's not even a medical soap opera anymore, it has basically become a medical circus where actors and actresses get paid for doing nothing, dreaming, kissing and performing stupid and unbelievable medical stuff.It pains me to write these, cause I was once a true fan of the series. The producers stretched it thin so much that it snapped a few seasons back without them noticing it. Cancel it already and if you have so much money to waste, at least think of a new worthy series, whatever it might be, with fresh and new ideas.Viewers scores (true or not) and fake popularity after two digits seasons are not everything.

2	I Just completed the episode that aired March 22. So glad to see a strong and serious episode without the recent silliness that I found highly disappointing and unfortunately more reflective of Rookie Fed. I was seriously aggravated by the honeymoon episode. The idea was good. How it played out was boring. This show has excellent actors who deserve an excellent script. The storyline was solid, the emotions of the actors, both the officers and the perpetrators, were real and skillfully portrayed. This show was the quality that I expect as a dedicated viewer from season 1, episode 1. Well done. I look forward to the next show.	complete episode air march glad see strong serious episode without recent silliness find highly disappoint unfortunately reflective rookie feed seriously aggravate honeymoon episode idea good play bore show excellent actor deserve excellent script storyline solid emotion actor officer perpetrator real skillfully portray show quality expect dedicate view season episode well do look forward next show

0	Where do I even begin with this disaster of a TV series? 'Fallout' is an absolute travesty that manages to squander every ounce of potential it had. From the poorly written dialogue to the laughable special effects, it's clear that the creators had no clue what made the original video game franchise so beloved.Let's start with the acting, or lack thereof. The performances are so wooden and uninspired that you'd think the cast was made up of department store mannequins. Not even the most talented actors could salvage the atrocious script they were given. Every line feels forced and devoid of any emotion, leaving viewers cringing in their seats.And don't even get me started on the production quality. The sets look like they were thrown together in someone's backyard, complete with cheap props and shoddy costumes. The CGI is so bad that it's almost comical, with mutant creatures resembling poorly rendered blobs rather than terrifying monstrosities.But perhaps the most unforgivable sin of 'Fallout' is how it completely misses the mark on capturing the essence of the video games. Gone is the sense of exploration and discovery, replaced instead with mind-numbingly dull plotlines and tedious exposition. It's as if the creators took everything that made the games great and tossed it out the window in favor of generic post-apocalyptic clichés.In conclusion, 'Fallout' is a train wreck of a TV series that should be avoided at all costs. Save yourself the agony and stick to playing the video games instead. At least then you'll have some semblance of enjoyment amidst the nuclear fallout of this abysmal adaptation.	even begin disaster tv series fallout absolute travesty manage squander every ounce potential poorly write dialogue laughable special effect clear creator clue make original video game franchise beloved let start act lack thereof performance wooden uninspired think cast make department store mannequin even talented actor could salvage atrocious script give every line feel force devoid emotion leave viewer cringe seat even get start production quality set look like throw together someone backyard complete cheap prop shoddy costume cgi bad almost comical mutant creature resemble poorly render blob rather terrify monstrositie perhaps unforgivable sin fallout completely miss mark capture essence video game go sense exploration discovery replace instead mind numbingly dull plotline tedious exposition creator take everything make game great toss window favor generic post apocalyptic clich conclusion fallout train wreck tv series avoid cost save agony stick play video game instead least semblance enjoyment amidst nuclear fallout abysmal adaptation
0	Sadly the excellent decoration is met with mediocre writing and brutal bad playing. The inability to grasp the hidden message, strange narrative just ot make thing clearer for a lazy brain. It is far away form the mystique, elegance and internal conflicts of the 80's series. The behavior is fully Americanized , the Japanese orientalism is fully depreciated. The actors play mediocre too, some lost their accent, some cannot grasp the internal conflict of the invisible. I was wondering why specific scenes are shoot just to make clearer what happens, where the master of the puppet will never have such conversations.	sadly excellent decoration meet mediocre write brutal bad play inability grasp hide message strange narrative ot make thing clear lazy brain far away form mystique elegance internal conflict series behavior fully americanize japanese orientalism fully depreciate actor play mediocre lose accent grasp internal conflict invisible wonder specific scene shoot make clear happen master puppet never conversation
0	"What a let down. The first two season are great. Some easy viewing, with decent acting, likable characters, a properly done diverse cast, Nathan Fillion, a decent mix between funny, serious and heart felt. Everyone brings something to the table, and believe it or not...nobody blames anything on race or gender for the entire first two seasons.Then season three rolls around and ruins everything. Now don't get me wrong, race and gender prejudice exist. And some shows do a really good job in tackling these issues. The Rookie does not!Two of our cops do a support program in a black neighborhood. A young black man breaks a car window and steals something. They catch him, but the bystanders have little praise because ""just another black man in handcuffs"". As the cops try to shine a light on the fact that this man committed a crime, and someone in this poor neighborhood now has a broken car window they need to fix, no one agrees, its still the cops fault for...whatever reason.As a former contractor, Nathan Fillions character puts in some work to fix up a local playground for kids. Instead of ANY recognition for good deed, or at least a good intention, he gets nothing but angry complaints, because the lights he fixed (the broken lights were a reason it was too dangerous for kids) now only attract meth dealers.Yeah...and that is his fault how? The people told him the lights are broken and thats a problem, now the working lights are a problem.No matter what he does, he always gets the blame, and the show makes this seem ok. Even his POC coworker, who until this point had never made a single comment about race prejudice stabs him in the back, always taking the other peoples side, regardless of how illogical it seems.There is a racist cop, a sexist doctor and many more ""problematic characters"", all of these things exist IRL, no question. But the way the are handled here is just paint by numbers lazy writing. No depth, no semblance of realism, just tropes and cliches, to show how bad the world treats women and minorities. Despite a vast number of the upper police Ranks being ethnic.And of course as an older white man, Nathan Fillion has never experienced any of these injustices in his life (despite him literally having heart of gold and a strong sense of justice, as former seasons keep pointing out), so he gladly takes in all these lessons on how its his fault people are criminals.4 Stars only because the two first seasons are good. But the third is barely watchable."	let first two season great easy view decent act likable character properly do diverse cast nathan fillion decent mix funny serious heart feel everyone bring something table believe nobody blame anything race gender entire first two season season three roll around ruin everything get wrong race gender prejudice exist show really good job tackle issue rookie two cop support program black neighborhood young black man break car window steal something catch bystander little praise another black man handcuff cop try shine light fact man commit crime someone poor neighborhood break car window need fix one agree still cop fault whatever reason former contractor nathan fillion character put work fix local playground kid instead recognition good deed least good intention get nothing angry complaint light fix break light reason dangerous kid attract meth dealer yeah fault people tell light break that s problem work light problem matter always get blame show make seem ok even poc coworker point never make single comment race prejudice stab back always take people side regardless illogical seem racist cop sexist doctor many problematic character thing exist irl question way handle paint number lazy write depth semblance realism trope cliche show bad world treat woman minority despite vast number upper police rank ethnic course old white man nathan fillion never experience injustice life despite literally heart gold strong sense justice former season keep point gladly take lesson fault people criminal star two first season good third barely watchable
2	It was definitely worth watching if you like science fiction. It's not the best sci-fi but it's mid-to high level. It's different than most sci-if movies/tv shows. I did not read the book so I had no idea what to expect. It has a little lull in the middle, when they are doing the AI headset game, so don't let that kick you off, just hold out and after that part, the puzzle pieces start coming together. It's almost, and maybe it is b/c I didn't read the book, alternative world/reality type with the science stuff in the beginning; it had me a little confused at first. The ending didn't leave you hanging too bad, but enough for a season 2.	definitely worth watch like science fiction good sci fi mid high level different sci movie tv show read book idea expect little lull middle ai headset game let kick hold part puzzle piece start come together almost maybe b c read book alternative world reality type science stuff begin little confuse first end leave hang bad enough season

1	"I only saw the first episode, and while it's generally very good, with good acting and a slow but engaging storyline, I have to point out one very obvious fault...It's obviously set in Japan in the 1600's, so the local characters speak japanese, and the foreign ship crew, a mix of dutch and english sailors speaking english. There's also spanish character that speaks with a spanish accent.So far, so good.The problem is the show has a lot to deal with the portuguese presence in Japan, and as such, several dialogues are supposed to be in portuguese, but in the show they're portrayed in english.I obviously know this is to create a better appeal to american and english-speaking audiences, but why do you have japanese speaking japanese, but no portuguese speaking portuguese?It can't state to be a grand production, with historically accurate costumes and storyline, and be so ""americanized"" at the same time!Other than that, I enjoyed the first episode and will probably follow with the next ones, though hoping there's a bit more action."	see first episode generally good good act slow engage storyline point one obvious fault obviously set japan local character speak japanese foreign ship crew mix dutch english sailor speak english also spanish character speak spanish accent far good problem show lot deal portuguese presence japan several dialogue suppose portuguese show portray english obviously know create well appeal american english speak audience japanese speak japanese portuguese speak portuguese state grand production historically accurate costume storyline americanize time enjoy first episode probably follow next one though hop bite action
1	The reason I needed to stop was the stupidity of the main character. There were times all he had to do was say something to avoid a catastrophic escalation but instead sat like a stunned mullet. Personally, I always feel that reflects weak writing. I also found it quite embarrassing that the writer claims to be a comedian. Not sure if the aim of the series was to make it as uncomfortable as possible to watch or of the writer is genuinely not funny.The silver lining for me was Martha, I got really involved with her character and the acting was superb. The fear I felt at times was genuine and she made the show for me.The overall story is very sad, it brought back memories of my early teens when I was groomed by an older man, a situation that I now realise I have never processed.I would recommend this to other people but would warn them it isn't an easy watch.	reason need stop stupidity main character time say something avoid catastrophic escalation instead sit like stun mullet personally always feel reflect weak write also find quite embarrass writer claim comedian sure aim series make uncomfortable possible watch writer genuinely funny silver line martha get really involve character act superb fear feel time genuine make show overall story sad bring back memory early teen groom old man situation realise never process would recommend people would warn easy watch

His support cast is also mostly excellent, leading mid-40's LAPD recruit John Nolan through his personal crucible.However, the longer the show goes on, the less of a rookie John Nolan becomes. Eventually he is elected Union Representative or something. At that point the show loses its identity, funny as the election campaign against Smitty may have been.They completely lost me in season 4 with the ""wrongly accused"" plot. The idea is interesting, but the character involved is so unlikable that I was rooting for him to fail at life and everything.

2	Very good start to this show. Most people hate reading subtitles. But to me, I'd rather have an authentic show with the characters speaking their native tongue. So which is why I couldn't give it a better score because the Spanish are speaking English. The story is great, It gives a game of thrones type of vibe. 5 families running Japan but there is always that 1 family above em all that doesn't want to be on top but it is their destiny. Not to mention the main character is English. His mission is to discover Japan which he heard stories about the Spaniards discovering Japan and keeping the country a secret from the rest of the world in a time where Spain and Europe are at war.	good start show people hate read subtitle rather authentic show character speak native tongue give well score spanish speak english story great give game throne type vibe family run japan always family em want top destiny mention main character english mission discover japan hear story spaniard discover japan keep country secret rest world time spain europe war

2	"I don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.'Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. Every ""country"", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. Of course, that was all already there in the books – but translating that so perfectly to a TV-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement.Yet for all its grandeur, scale and breath-taking visuals, what really makes Martin's outstanding work come to life on the small screen is the fantastic ensemble of actors. At the core of this show (any show, really) are the characters. Tyrion, Cersei, Dany, Jamie and John (and all the – many – others) don't lose anything of their complexity; the amazing cast succeeds in showing all their respective characters' inner conflicts and often questionable motivations and virtually no one comes across as one-dimensional (except maybe for Joffrey).There have been a couple of great TV-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale AND quality, 'Game of Thrones' is – at the moment – in a league of its own.

0	First of all I'm not a fan of the franchise but I like the first two games and New Vegas. I couldn't care less about they ruining this franchise further as nothing can ruin the aforementioned Fallout video games for me anyway.The story basically doesn't exist. It's not much different than Fallout 3's story. The whole point of the TV Series is just watching Fallout-themed media and remembering the good old days of playing the video games, not to actually enjoy a TV series to watch. In that regard I would say it's low-quality fan media but I can't because Fallout: Nuka Break and Fallout: Red Star is way better than this TV series for a fan content. So it makes this TV series just a greedy tool to milk a franchise in the worst way possible content.That being said if you are not familiar with the Fallout franchise I don't think things would make sense as there is zero care for a new audience to Fallout. For example I don't think anyone who didn't played the video games can actually understand what's a vault nor what kind of setting this version of world is in this TV series.Despite the aim of making you remember Fallout there was a little from the video games. It's more like they took the fundamentals and they did their own things. There is not even single super mutant but briefly mentioned around end of the season. The only familiar enemy was mutant cockroaches, bear and feral ghouls and that's it. As for weapon only pistol, assault rifle laser rifle was familiar. There is Vault stuff, Nuka Cola and its caps, some foods, Brother of Steel, NCR Ranger outfit, mention of Enclave and that's all about there to see from video games.Basically 2 episodes of content stretched to 8 episodes so yeah every episode is too slow and long. Some of the dialogues are so ridiculous I hope they used an AI because I don't wanna think a person was mentally okay and was good with this. IDK if there will be a 2nd season but sure as hell I ain't watching it. If I wasn't free I would stop at 1st episode instead watching the whole season.Instead of unnecessary nudity it would be great if there was necessary Fallout gore. The gore there is is not enough for a Fallout media. I would wanna see V. A. T. S. targeting at least in one combat but I guess they didn't actually play any of the video games.There are two good things I can say about this tv series. First is very famous actors and actresses plays in it and second is sometimes hearing music from the video games in the right time. Other than these there is no redeeming quality whatsoever.	first fan franchise like first two game new vegas care less ruin franchise nothing ruin aforementione fallout video game anyway story basically exist much different fallout story whole point tv series watch fallout theme medium remember good old day play video game actually enjoy tv series watch regard would say low quality fan medium fallout nuka break fallout red star way well tv series fan content make tv series greedy tool milk franchise bad way possible content say familiar fallout franchise think thing would make sense zero care new audience fallout example think anyone play video game actually understand vault kind set version world tv series despite aim make remember fallout little video game like take fundamental thing even single super mutant briefly mention around end season familiar enemy mutant cockroach bear feral ghouls weapon pistol assault rifle laser rifle familiar vault stuff nuka cola cap food brother steel ncr ranger outfit mention enclave see video game basically episode content stretch episode yeah every episode slow long dialogue ridiculous hope use ai wan na think person mentally okay good idk nd season sure hell watch free would stop st episode instead watch whole season instead unnecessary nudity would great necessary fallout gore gore enough fallout medium would wan na see v target least one combat guess actually play video game two good thing say tv series first famous actor actress play second sometimes hear music video game right time redeem quality whatsoever
2	I wasn't really sure what to expect going into Sugar, I wasn't familiar with the story at all but Colin Farrell was starring in it so I was definitely going to at least give it a chance. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it. Anytime a A-list actor like Farrell does a tv show I'm usually going to give it a chance because if it's good enough to get a big name like that it must be worth watching. There are a ton of detective shows to choose from out there, it seems like even more so this year, so a show must be good enough to stick out from the bunch to get people to watch and Sugar is. The acting & writing aren't the only good things going for this show, it's also beautifully shot. It has a real stylish throwback to classic noir films to it.

If you can't bring in someone as charismatic as Alain Delon's Ripley (but honesty who can beat that) or as ambivalent as Matt Damon's Ripley, because Matt Damon's Ripley really got us with his innocent, studious look and yet callous presence, just please don't cast an actor who definetely cannot project a certain sense of naivity, misleading innocence, error of youth, elegance or irresistable charm (and not just plain charm) all of which are also an undelible part of Ripley's character.For a black and white Andrew Scott reinforces the creepiness of Ripley but Ripley is about much more than creepiness, cruelty, arrogance or emotional distance and this just doesn't get you to feel for Ripley the way Alain Delon did (we were even hoping for Delon's Ripley to get away with it). It pains me because he is an outstanding theatre actor and was the best Moriarty ever. That being said, if you have never watched the previous two adaptations or read any of Highsmith's books this might work quite well for you but otherwise this is honetsly simplistic and one dimensional Ripley.In all fairness, they could have done a different show with Andrew Scott along the lines of the character he is playing but this should have been an original script and certainly not a Highsmith's adaptation.	andrew scott great actor miscast ripley bring someone charismatic alain delon ripley honesty beat ambivalent matt damon ripley matt damon ripley really get we innocent studious look yet callous presence please cast actor definetely project certain sense naivity mislead innocence error youth elegance irresistable charm plain charm also undelible part ripley character black white andrew scott reinforce creepiness ripley ripley much creepiness cruelty arrogance emotional distance get feel ripley way alain delon even hop delon ripley get away pain outstanding theatre actor good moriarty ever say never watch previous two adaptation read highsmith book might work quite well otherwise honetsly simplistic one dimensional ripley fairness could do different show andrew scott along line character play original script certainly highsmith adaptation
2	...And soaps can go on for generations. Just look at All My Children (40+ years) and The Bold and the Beautiful (36 years) and General Hospital since 1963! Let go of expecttions of more and it's an interesting show without cops and violence. That's a big plus in my book. All that being said, I've watched the entire series several times from the beginning and I still strongly and intensely dislike Dr Robbins. What a whiny, self-centered, egotistical character. (I've often wondered if the writers have a friend or family member they've used as a template for her.) All the rest of the characters with their eccentricities I've enjoyed or at least understood on some level. But she is just a royal pain in the a$$. But I'll keep watching because it is entertaining enough that I come back each season and everyone isn't killing each other. Major kudos for those from the original cast for hanging in there.	soap go generation look child year bold beautiful year general hospital since let go expecttion interest show without cop violence big plus book say watch entire series several time begin still strongly intensely dislike dr robbins whiny self center egotistical character often wonder writer friend family member use template rest character eccentricity enjoy least understand level royal pain keep watch entertain enough come back season everyone kill major kudo original cast hang

The characters are absolutely believable and very-well cast.I love how they worked in connected particle ideas for being able to spy on us from more than 400 light years away.And there's that absolutely fascinating idea about how one race might attempt to solve its own existential problems at the expense of another race, and how that might play out in the REAL universe.

0	How could anyone think it is a good show is beyond me.The writing is very poor. Predictable and ridiculous. Nothing is accurate, it's hard to watch.The main character is a white male dating only younger women who look like models. Actually they all look like they are coming from a model agency, it is not representative of the real world.This is so tiring to see that these kind of show is what people want.With a budget like this they could do so much better.As for the Comedy, is it supposed to be funny???I can understand that sometimes we all need to watch sthg light but the inaccuracy and stupidity is unbearable.	could anyone think good show beyond write poor predictable ridiculous nothing accurate hard watch main character white male date young woman look like model actually look like come model agency representative real world tire see kind show people want budget like could much well comedy suppose funny understand sometimes need watch sthg light inaccuracy stupidity unbearable
2	Don't get me wrong. I still watch grey's anatomy till this day, but one thing I can't get over is how much this show has changed since Shonda Rhimes left as show runner and Krista Vernoff took the reins. Some of the story lines are simply repetitive. In my opinion Jackson Avery has no story left telling after April was written off the show. Owen is one of the worst characters to ever exist. I truly hate his hypocritical views. Arizona and April leaving was a HUGE mistake in my opinion. They both had interesting stories worth telling. The way Alex Karev went back to his toxic ex wife as a way to explain Justin Chambers leaving the show was insane. Was there no other way of ending his story in a better situation??? Meredith is like a cat. She's like on her 6th life. Can't tell if she's actually going to make it out of this COVID19 story line. Joe is just a good character that no longer has a meaning after Alex was written off the show. Miranda is there because she has to. She's the chief. Great. Dr. Webber aswell, he's just around. There is not much a personal story to follow from his perspective. Jackson's mom is around because she owns the hospital. Idk. I just think it's time for this show that has given us so much good tv to come to an end. And I give it a 8 because even though I don't like some aspects about this show it still enjoy watching it!!	get wrong still watch grey anatomy till day one thing get much show change since shonda rhime leave show runner krista vernoff take rein story line simply repetitive opinion jackson avery story leave tell april write show owen one bad character ever exist truly hate hypocritical view arizona april leave huge mistake opinion interest story worth tell way alex karev go back toxic ex wife way explain justin chamber leave show insane way end story well situation meredith like cat like th life tell actually go make covid story line joe good character long mean alex write show miranda chief great dr webber aswell around much personal story follow perspective jackson mom around own hospital idk think time show give we much good tv come end give even though like aspect show still enjoy watch
2	9-9.5? No. We'll see how it progresses, but it's solid so far. I'm also a big fan of the original mini-series and this this one has A LOT to live up to. We'll see how they compare over the course of the series, but they've certainly favoured noticeable CGI over authenticity in some locations and 'camera' shots. If I had a gripe through 2 episodes it would be the portrayal of female characters. IMO, the series has ignored the status of women - even those of higher status - in feudal Japan in favour of a more contemporary portrayal. If you haven't seen the original, I recommend you do. Melodramatic period style aside, it's really expansive and epic.	see progress solid far also big fan original mini series one lot live see compare course series certainly favour noticeable cgi authenticity location camera shot gripe episode would portrayal female character imo series ignore status woman even high status feudal japan favour contemporary portrayal see original recommend melodramatic period style aside really expansive epic
0	"A Frustrating Symphony of Missed PotentialThe allure of Cixin Liu's ""Three-Body Problem"" trilogy is undeniable. Imagine a world scrambling to prepare for an impending alien invasion, fueled by a chaotic, physics-bending message from a distant civilization. This captivating premise drew me to the Netflix adaptation, ""3 Body Problem,"" with eager anticipation. However, the series ultimately falls short, becoming a frustrating symphony of missed potential plagued by narrative choices that leave the viewer bewildered and irritated.A Story Drowning in Exposition Dumps:The show's greatest flaw lies in its pacing and storytelling structure. Instead of immersing viewers in the escalating tension and paranoia of the impending alien threat, the narrative gets bogged down in lengthy exposition dumps. Characters deliver monologues filled with scientific jargon and historical references, leaving the audience feeling like they're attending a crash course on astrophysics rather than watching a sci-fi drama. These information dumps often feel inorganic, disrupting the emotional flow and hindering character development.Characters Reduced to Mouthpieces for Exposition:Speaking of characters, the show fails to truly flesh them out. They become mere vessels for delivering the dense scientific concepts and historical backdrop. Their motivations, personalities, and emotional journeys remain underdeveloped. We see glimpses of potential in characters like Ye Wenjie, the astrophysicist wrestling with guilt and disillusionment, or Wang Miao, the bewildered nanomaterials researcher thrust into a world of conspiracies. However, these intriguing possibilities are never fully explored, leaving the viewer emotionally detached from their struggles.A Disconnect Between Visuals and Narrative:The show's visual effects are undeniably impressive. The depiction of the Trisolaran fleet, their warped physics, and the devastating societal collapse are visually stunning. However, these impressive visuals often feel disconnected from the narrative. They don't enhance the emotional impact of the story, instead serving as flashy distractions from the show's deeper themes of societal upheaval and humanity's place in the universe.Irritating Narrative ChoicesBeyond the structural issues, a series of baffling creative decisions further hamper the show's potential. The constant shifts between timelines, particularly the jarring jumps to the Cultural Revolution period, feel unnecessary and disrupt the narrative flow. Additionally, the show's reliance on convenient plot devices, such as conveniently timed character encounters or sudden bursts of convenient knowledge, leave a sour taste.A Glimmer of Hope, Lost in Frustration:Despite its shortcomings, the series does have its moments. The exploration of the societal impact of the Trisolaran threat, with its paranoia and fracturing world order, holds promise. There are also glimpses of a more character-driven narrative, particularly in the portrayal of Wang Miao's personal struggles. However, these fleeting moments are ultimately overshadowed by the show's frustrating reliance on exposition and its underdeveloped characters.Conclusion: A Symphony of Missed Notes""3 Body Problem"" is a show brimming with ambition but ultimately fails to deliver on its potential. The narrative drowns in exposition, the characters lack depth, and puzzling creative choices leave the viewer frustrated rather than engaged. While the visuals are impressive and the premise captivating, the show ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to create a truly compelling sci-fi drama. For those seeking a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant exploration of an alien invasion, ""3 Body Problem"" might leave you feeling like you've just sat through a frustrating symphony of missed notes."	frustrate symphony miss potentialthe allure cixin liu three body problem trilogy undeniable imagine world scramble prepare impend alien invasion fuel chaotic physic bend message distant civilization captivate premise draw netflix adaptation body problem eager anticipation however series ultimately fall short become frustrate symphony miss potential plague narrative choice leave view bewilder irritate story drown exposition dump show great flaw lie pace storytelle structure instead immerse viewer escalate tension paranoia impend alien threat narrative get bogge lengthy exposition dump character deliver monologue fill scientific jargon historical reference leave audience feel like attend crash course astrophysic rather watch sci fi drama information dump often feel inorganic disrupt emotional flow hinder character development character reduce mouthpiece exposition speak character show fail truly flesh become mere vessel deliver dense scientific concept historical backdrop motivation personality emotional journey remain underdevelop see glimpse potential character like ye wenjie astrophysicist wrestle guilt disillusionment wang miao bewilder nanomaterials researcher thrust world conspiracy however intrigue possibility never fully explore leave viewer emotionally detach struggle disconnect visual narrative show visual effect undeniably impressive depiction trisolaran fleet warp physics devastate societal collapse visually stun however impressive visual often feel disconnect narrative enhance emotional impact story instead serve flashy distraction show deep theme societal upheaval humanity place universe irritate narrative choicesbeyond structural issue series baffle creative decision hamper show potential constant shift timeline particularly jar jump cultural revolution period feel unnecessary disrupt narrative flow additionally show reliance convenient plot device conveniently time character encounter sudden burst convenient knowledge leave sour taste glimmer hope lose frustration despite shortcoming series moment exploration societal impact trisolaran threat paranoia fracture world order hold promise also glimpse character drive narrative particularly portrayal wang miao personal struggle however fleet moment ultimately overshadow show frustrate reliance exposition underdevelop character conclusion symphony miss note body problem show brim ambition ultimately fail deliver potential narrative drown exposition character lack depth puzzle creative choice leave view frustrate rather engage visual impressive premise captivate show ultimately feel like miss opportunity create truly compel sci fi drama seek think provoke emotionally resonant exploration alien invasion body problem might leave feel like sit frustrate symphony miss note
0	As expected, this is nothing but the typical easily palatable generic theme park ride version of Fallout, akin to a bethesda game so in that sense, it is the perfect video game adaptation.Its boring, predictable and everything looks cheap, developers just need to copy the general iconography of the series and remix its narrative elements into a formulaic narrative for the masses.Art is divisive, this is not art but trash. It deserves a 3, but for the sake of scale tipping, it gets a one. Something like this is only possible in a world where visual iliteracy is at an all-time high and i dream of what would be possible if fallout and other projects, film or otherwise, were made with artistic freedom and intention.	expect nothing typical easily palatable generic theme park ride version fallout akin bethesda game sense perfect video game adaptation bear predictable everything look cheap developer need copy general iconography series remix narrative element formulaic narrative mass art divisive art trash deserve sake scale tip get one something like possible world visual iliteracy time high dream would possible fallout project film otherwise make artistic freedom intention
1	Seasons 1 through 3 were AMAZING. 10/10. Seasons 4 through 7 became slow and felt lacking in direction at times, but there were hints of it starting to come back which kept me invested. Season 8 was so awful that I can no longer call myself a Game of Thrones fan.Season 8 introduced continuity errors and lazy writing. Worse still, the central theme that was established in the very first episode of the series and built up throughout the whole show was concluded in the THIRD episode of the last season in the most anti-climactic way I have ever seen!However, I don't think we should be *too* hard on Season 8. After all, it has saved me hundreds of dollars on a Blu-Ray box set, merchandise and celeb autographs at conventions. I can't think of any other TV show that has saved me money by watching it.How I calculated my score:S1: 10 S2: 10 S3: 10 S4: 5 S5: 5 S6: 5 S7: 5 S8: -10= 40 / 8 = 5	season amaze season become slow feel lack direction time hint start come back keep invest season awful long call game throne fan season introduce continuity error lazy write bad still central theme establish first episode series build throughout whole show conclude third episode last season anti climactic way ever see however think hard season save hundred dollar blu ray box set merchandise celeb autograph convention think tv show save money watch calculate score

The development of the characters mixed in with the medical setting makes for a really solid show. Seasons 7 and 8 of the show were good, but I usually end my rewatch of it after the season 6 finales. Seasons 9 and 10 were ok, and after that, it's not even worth it anymore.

2	"Sugar is a commendable series that skillfully incorporates elements of classic hardboiled detective stories into a contemporary setting. The show strikes a balance between paying homage to the genre's traditions and adapting them for today's audience.The lead character, reminiscent of the archetypal private eye, brings a certain charm and authenticity to the role, making the series engaging for both aficionados of the genre and new viewers. The dialogue is sharp, and the plot is well-crafted, with enough twists to maintain interest without being overly complex.The modern take on the genre is evident in the show's approach to character diversity and social issues, which adds depth and relevance to the narrative. The visual style nods to the noir roots while maintaining a current aesthetic that suits the show's tone.Overall, ""Sugar"" is a solid series that offers a fresh take on the detective genre, and it's worth watching for its clever writing, strong performances, and thoughtful update of classic tropes."	sugar commendable series skillfully incorporate element classic hardboile detective story contemporary set show strike balance pay homage genre tradition adapt today audience lead character reminiscent archetypal private eye bring certain charm authenticity role make series engage aficionado genre new viewer dialogue sharp plot well craft enough twist maintain interest without overly complex modern take genre evident show approach character diversity social issue add depth relevance narrative visual style nod noir root maintain current aesthetic suit show tone overall sugar solid series offer fresh take detective genre worth watch clever write strong performance thoughtful update classic trope

1	The Rookie's premise is simple enough; a series about rookie police officers where one of them is a forty-something guy struggling to prove himself.The first episode hits all the expected marks. Seasoned veterans screwing with the rookies as they plot to rise in the ranks. Humor mixed with drama. A little tragedy. Hints at back stories.Was anything genuinely surprising? Not really. Deeply moving? Nope. But it's all pretty watchable. The acting is solid, the thing is well filmed (although the cop-cam shots don't add much), the script flows well.For me, this falls in the category of shows-I'd-watch-if-there-wasn't-so-much-TV-to-choose-from. It's all fine, but I feel no need to watch any more.	rookie premise simple enough series rookie police officer one forty something guy struggle prove first episode hit expect mark season veteran screw rookie plot rise rank humor mix drama little tragedy hint back story anything genuinely surprise really deeply move nope pretty watchable act solid thing well film although cop cam shot add much script flow well fall category show watch much tv choose fine feel need watch

2	The main character Blackthorne looks like a low IQ dolt. I can't stand his limp cry baby facial expressions, but for the rest, the series is eminently watchable. Still, the original with legendary actor Richard Chamberlain was much better. Overall one say the Japanese cast performed better than the Europeans. One of the series' greatest strengths is its exploration of cultural differences and the clash of civilizations between East and West. Through the eyes of Blackthorne, viewers gain insight into the intricacies of Japanese society, from its strict hierarchical structure to its emphasis on honor and duty. This cultural exchange serves as a powerful lens through which to examine universal themes of identity, loyalty, and human nature.	main character blackthorne look like low iq dolt stand limp cry baby facial expression rest series eminently watchable still original legendary actor richard chamberlain much well overall one say japanese cast perform well europeans one series great strength exploration cultural difference clash civilization east west eye blackthorne viewer gain insight intricacy japanese society strict hierarchical structure emphasis honor duty cultural exchange serve powerful lens examine universal theme identity loyalty human nature

One review called this the Disney version of Fallout and I think that's a perfect comparison. There wasn't much danger when traveling outside. And the people inside seemed like campy people from the 50s. Like a Leave it to Beaver cast.The show also bounced around far too much and I don't feel that that they handled that all too well. Often I had to ask myself ""did I miss something?""Two last points...there was ZERO explanation as to why Moldaver was still alive. She's a key character. Kinda feels like that should have been touched on. And at the beginning the raiders were radioactive but weren't scanned?"	excite show come though limit expectation play new vegas fallout love show seem bite light hearte one review call disney version fallout think perfect comparison much danger travel outside people inside seem like campy people like leave beaver cast show also bounce around far much feel handle well often ask miss something two last point zero explanation moldaver still alive key character kinda feel like touch begin raider radioactive scan

2	"GOT should have been the greatest television series ever made. And until the end of season 6 it was. The show had everything: superb writing, outstanding production values, epic scale, gritty and complex characters, likable villains and unlikable heroes, blood and guts, plenty of suspense and let's not forget some pretty frank treatment of sex too. The show was very modern (e.g. Most of its surviving leading characters were women), without being preachy or shrill about it. One of the GOT's most appealing aspects has always been that it's hard to distinguish heroes from villains here, and the show tries hard tp prevent the viewers from classifying the characters in those terms. (Of course, there are exceptions, like Joffrey.) While over time the audience gets more and more emotionally invested in the characters of Daeneris and Jon, and to somewhat lesser extent Arya and Sansa, they are also portrayed as rather flawed, complex and contradictory figures, that chase and grow over time. For me the high point of the show was episode 10 of season 6, with the aftermath of Cersei's trial. If the show had ended then, I would have gave it 10/10. The 7-th season was still watchable and entertaining but the quality of writing clearly went down. While the pace of the action picked up, somehow it also felt more perfunctory and it became harder to care. Nothing like the episode ""The Door"" in this season. And the of course comes season 8. As many other reviewers noted, a complete and utter disaster. The writing completely collapsed, cartoonishly so, and the storyline became nonsensical and full of holes. A good final episode might have still saved the season and the series but instead we were handed a cruel and disgusting joke. For much of the duration of the series the show's creators prided themselves on unexpected plot twists and staying ahead of the audience, keeping it guessing. But that cannot be the point of the grand finale of the magnum epic like GOT. Here you have to deliver the expected. The most predictable and the most satisfying moment in the final episode was the ""Clegane bowl"". And I have not heard anyone complain about it. But you cannot build up the audience's emotional investment in the fate of the main character over the period of 8 years and then suddenly turn her form a queen-to-be into a raving mass murderer and kill her off. And on top of that discard the second most important character in the series as an unimportant afterthought. That's a complete betrayal of the loyalties of the audience of the series and it made it impossible to rewatch the show for most people. A great pity, really, since many of the early episodes are true masterpieces. But the vanity and the stupidity of the writers in the finale killed the entire series."	get great television series ever make end season show everything superb write outstanding production value epic scale gritty complex character likable villain unlikable hero blood gut plenty suspense let forget pretty frank treatment sex show modern e g survive lead character woman without preachy shrill one get appeal aspect always hard distinguish hero villain show try hard tp prevent viewer classify character term course exception like joffrey time audience get emotionally invest character daeneris jon somewhat less extent arya sansa also portray rather flaw complex contradictory figure chase grow time high point show episode season aftermath cersei trial show end would give th season still watchable entertain quality write clearly go pace action pick somehow also feel perfunctory become hard care nothing like episode door season course come season many reviewer note complete utter disaster write completely collapse cartoonishly storyline become nonsensical full hole good final episode might still save season series instead hand cruel disgust joke much duration series show creator pride unexpected plot twist stay ahead audience keep guess point grand finale magnum epic like get deliver expect predictable satisfy moment final episode clegane bowl hear anyone complain build audience emotional investment fate main character period year suddenly turn form queen rave mass murderer kill top discard second important character series unimportant afterthought complete betrayal loyalty audience series make impossible rewatch show people great pity really since many early episode true masterpiece vanity stupidity writer finale kill entire series
2	Fortunately, I knew nothing about the books and watched without prejudice. I enjoyed it immensely! The series is in my opnion at least an 8 and will probably eventually score even higher. To the book readers, who I think are rather disappointed, don't behave so spoiled. Enjoy the beautiful visuals and the fact that you get such stunning imagery for a few euros a month. Also, I have to laugh at the criticism that it's so unlikely for young people to have such prestigieus scientific jobs. As if what else happens in this series is so likely! Sci-fi is sci-fi, I would say. And 'young' people can achieve stunning resulta, why not?! By the way, at the age of these scientists, Mozart was almost deceased. So why couldn't it be possible? Anyway, I'm looking forward to the sequels and will definitely watch. A beautiful series and thank you for making it!	fortunately know nothing book watch without prejudice enjoy immensely series opnion least probably eventually score even high book reader think rather disappoint behave spoil enjoy beautiful visual fact get stun imagery euro month also laugh criticism unlikely young people prestigieus scientific job else happen series likely sci fi sci fi would say young people achieve stun resulta way age scientist mozart almost decease possible anyway look forward sequel definitely watch beautiful series thank make
2	I started watching this show merely because people around me asked me to. By the end of Season 1 it really had me invested my time and curiosity. Later seasons got me completely hooked and made me a kind of free marketing agent for this show since I was telling my friends to watch this show.I believe the graph of the show starts at the lowest point and from ending season 1 gets a drastic rise. In my opinion it peaks at Season 4 and slowly declines from there. From Season 7 it drops completely and utterly.The last season had my huffing and puffing at every turning point, I would like to appreciate the cinematography of Season 8 which is by far the best in the whole show. The music I would say was best in season 6 and 7.It remains my favorite show till date, and yet the perfect example of 'Messing up something absolutely beautiful'.	start watch show merely people around ask end season really invest time curiosity later season get completely hook make kind free market agent show since tell friend watch show believe graph show start low point end season get drastic rise opinion peak season slowly decline season drop completely utterly last season huff puff every turn point would like appreciate cinematography season far good whole show music would say good season remain favorite show till date yet perfect example mess something absolutely beautiful

0	Trying ones best to be objective, the first 3 or 4 seasons of this show were quite brilliant, but since then it's decline has been difficult to watch. Now in the final season, there is really no need to watch the series to its conclusion, because the second half of the show can safely be ignored as poor writing reduces a groundbreaking show to Bold and the Beautiful levels of quality.The ending doesn't matter because the ethos of the show has been abandoned as the producers chase hype not excellence. Gone is the subtlety that marked GoT as something truly different, instead it is big, loud, cheesy, and predictable. Pure convention in other words. Characters lose their characteristics, and inconvenient plot threads shoved aside in favour of standard Hollywood B movie schlock.As a whole, despite the riveting first few seasons, the show eventually collapses on itself, and is a chore to watch from season 7 onwards.If you haven't seen it yet, avoid the disappointment.	try one well objective first season show quite brilliant since decline difficult watch final season really need watch series conclusion second half show safely ignore poor write reduce groundbreaking show bold beautiful level quality end matter ethos show abandon producers chase hype excellence go subtlety mark get something truly different instead big loud cheesy predictable pure convention word character lose characteristic inconvenient plot thread shove aside favour standard hollywood b movie schlock whole despite rivet first season show eventually collapse chore watch season onwards see yet avoid disappointment
0	Before season 8 I loved Game of Thrones but the writers truly screwed up. I feel Game of Thrones has been going downhill since season 6 when they had no source material ( A song of Ice and Fire) but it has truly fallen this last season with apparent lack of money clearly affecting the plot despite them being offered more money by HBO which is seen when Rhaegal is killed easily by Cerseis Scorpions while daenarys casually flys over the Iron fleet which I believe is for production reasons and then at King landing the Scorpions are clearly nerfed with it taking longer to reload and horrible accuracy. Also Ghosts farewell in episode 4 was lacking in emotion which the director David Nutter said was due to it being expensive and time consuming, sorry for your trouble. I could rant forever but before season 8 I would probably have rated it a 6 and before season 6 it would be 10 ultimately this is the writers doing and they certainly don't deserve a star wars trilogy Ryan Johnson has done enough to ruin Star Wars never mind these guys.	season love game throne writer truly screw feel game throne go downhill since season source material song ice fire truly fall last season apparent lack money clearly affect plot despite offer money hbo see rhaegal kill easily cerseis scorpion daenary casually fly iron fleet believe production reason king land scorpion clearly nerfe take long reload horrible accuracy also ghost farewell episode lack emotion director david nutter say due expensive time consume sorry trouble could rant forever season would probably rat season would ultimately writer certainly deserve star war trilogy ryan johnson do enough ruin star war never mind guy

0	Adapting a video game is always tough, but this series does it very well. Every scene looks amazing and seemingly stays true to the spirit of the game.The first episode had me hooked. Lucy and Ghoul introduced (both great characters) and the action after the wedding was awesome. And then....Every scene in the vault was absolutely dreadful to get through once Lucy leaves it. Watching freakin Rico from Hannah Montana suspiciously and somberly walk around for 7 episodes was ridiculous. The humor from Lucy's cousin & other leaders of the vault was awful.Finn, I mean Maximus, was unbearably boring of a character. They really forced a love connection between him and Lucy and really just copied Finn's story from Star Wars.Scenes just went on way too long. Every flashback with Walton Coggins and his wife was just too long and rather boring. The reveal that Lucy's dad was actually bad was very bad. The acting from Lucy was great, but I really don't need 2 full mins of her sad face reacting to the news and her dad pleading in the cage that it wasn't true.The cameos just seemed mid as well. Why have Fred Armisen and not do anything funny in his scene. Matt Berry could have been utilized better too.Idk it just really annoyed me more than I enjoyed it. Giving it props for looking so good though and really enjoyed Lucy as a character & the actress. Walton Coggins of course always killing it.If this tells me one thing, BIOSHOCK SERIES NEEDS TO HAPPEN.	adapt video game always tough series well every scene look amaze seemingly stay true spirit game first episode hook lucy ghoul introduce great character action we d awesome every scene vault absolutely dreadful get lucy leave watch freakin rico hannah montana suspiciously somberly walk around episode ridiculous humor lucy cousin leader vault awful finn mean maximus unbearably bore character really force love connection lucy really copy finn story star war scene go way long every flashback walton coggin wife long rather bore reveal lucy dad actually bad bad act lucy great really need full min sad face react news dad plead cage true cameo seem mid well fred armisen anything funny scene matt berry could utilize well idk really annoy enjoy give prop look good though really enjoy lucy character actress walton coggin course always kill tell one thing bioshock series need happen
0	"The premise of the show is intriguing, but certain casting choices hard to swallow. As someone who works at a top university and occasionally crosses paths with remarkable scientists, many of whom are seasoned with significant experience (over the age of 40. . . At least), frankly, the characters seem too young to be 'remarkable scientists.' This takes away from the believability of the story and makes it a hard watch.I'm probably a stick in the mud on this, but for me characters have to align in age or approximate age with the character's professional background. That's like my pet peeve. I mean, a 20 year old super scientist doesn't work for a serious storyline, unless it's a comedy. And really, is there any, allow me to create a word, ""scientisting"" going on here? This is typical Hollywood over the past 30 years. Let's target the age of who we think will view this movie. Never mind the actual story and characters.There's more, the story lacks a connection to the characters. It's possible that this disconnect is from the overarching focus on a future event, coupled with it being a series. A television series provides ample opportunity for character development, but with this targeted under 21-30 audience and no feeling for the characters this also makes it a hard watch.I am intrigued by the premise and curious to see how it unfolds, but as it stands, I may not be on board to finish this season.Maybe I should read the book!"	premise show intrigue certain cast choice hard swallow someone work top university occasionally cross path remarkable scientist many season significant experience age least frankly character seem young remarkable scientist take away believability story make hard watch probably stick mud character align age approximate age character professional background like pet peeve mean year old super scientist work serious storyline unless comedy really allow create word scientiste go typical hollywood past year let target age think view movie never mind actual story character story lack connection character possible disconnect overarch focus future event couple series television series provide ample opportunity character development target audience feel character also make hard watch intrigue premise curious see unfold stand may board finish season maybe read book
2	Season 1-4 were practically perfect, there is not much to say. It had so many great moments, so many great episodes there. But then... well the writers kinda ran out of books to adapt. Season 5 and 6 were pretty boring most of the time. But they truly had their moments even having some of the best episodes of the show. Season 7 you could really see the dip in quality. Everything just felt so rushed most of it was really stupid. And then ofc. Season 8 the biggest disapointment I have ever seen. I have never seen anything more terrible. The ending was the stupidest thing i have ever seen. All of the characters were just so stupid. Everything felt even more rushed. And all the characters were basically ruined because of the writing. Overall i still give it a 9/10 just because of the first half of the show. And ofc it did still have its moments. I would still consider this show a masterpiece and I would 100% recomend. It is truly a must watch show.	season practically perfect much say many great moment many great episode well writer kinda run book adapt season pretty bore time truly moment even good episode show season could really see dip quality everything feel rush really stupid ofc season big disapointment ever see never see anything terrible end stupid thing ever see character stupid everything feel even rush character basically ruin write overall still give first half show ofc still moment would still consider show masterpiece would recomend truly must watch show
2	After feeling that streaming had past it's halcyon days for a while now different platforms have blown me away over the last couple of weeks.Ripley was a superb retelling of a book I love and now this drops straight after.I've never seen or played the game, am aware of some of the imagery but not any characters or narrative. So for me, this has to stand alone and I have no idea if it is true to the source.However, who cares? I know it's popular to moan about things not respecting source material but if it's this good, can't we just enjoy it?The best bit for me is the overarching narrative of big business taking control of governments. Feel relevant?The main characters are well established and brilliantly played. With some of the side characters feeling a little underdone.The story was defined and well executed with just enough tension and confusing to keep me guessing.Decent dialogue, dark and sometimes childlike humour work together with superb production values and direction.It's funny, weird, engaging and in some places brilliantly gory.Is streaming getting its mojo back?	feel stream past halcyon day different platform blow away last couple week ripley superb retell book love drop straight never see play game aware imagery character narrative stand alone idea true source however care know popular moan thing respect source material good enjoy good bite overarch narrative big business take control government feel relevant main character well establish brilliantly play side character feel little underdone story define well execute enough tension confuse keep guess decent dialogue dark sometimes childlike humour work together superb production value direction funny weird engage place brilliantly gory stream get mojo back

2	I thought this show was going to be around first year interns at a Seattle Hospital. I wasn't expecting Meredith Grey to be the central character. I love watching Sandra Oh and Patrick Dempsey. They are both excellent actors themselves. With the success of Sideways, Sandra can be singing all the way to the bank. She is very entertaining to watch even in this show. I would say this is an average show. I like the fact that Meredith is the daughter of a famous surgeon who now does not remember her own name possibly from Alzheimer's disease. I do not understand networks who keep trying to use the same familiar surroundings like a hospital or a police station in dramas. There are too many dramas on today. I would much rather have something original. Since it comes after Desperate Housewives, it is not a bad show. It just needs time to grow. There are good episodes sometimes but I think the characters are so involved in their personal love lives that they have forgotten medicine sometimes. I don't think this show is evolving appropriately to combine love, medicine, story lines, and a mixture of it equally. I love Kate Burton who appears as Ellis Grey, Meredith's mother. Anyway, it has become Ally McBeal meets ER now rather than St. Elsewhere.	think show go around first year intern seattle hospital expect meredith grey central character love watch sandra oh patrick dempsey excellent actor success sideways sandra sing way bank entertain watch even show would say average show like fact meredith daughter famous surgeon remember name possibly alzheimer disease understand network keep try use familiar surround like hospital police station drama many drama today would much rather something original since come desperate housewife bad show need time grow good episode sometimes think character involve personal love live forget medicine sometimes think show evolve appropriately combine love medicine story line mixture equally love kate burton appear ellis grey meredith mother anyway become ally mcbeal meet er rather st elsewhere
1	I had read the books years before the series came out and was a bit dubious about how it would translate to the screen. I then saw HBO were doing it which eased my worries as they make some superb programmes, and when I finally got to watch it, it is superb from the first scene.Excellent casting, acting and staying close to the books this was the best programme on TV for years!The problem is the series overtook the books and since then it has gone downhill, especially the final series. There is a massive battle which should be incredible but I found it a real let down, and the episodes after this are even worse. These characters that have been so well developed over the years suddenly act in ways that are just bizarre, I'm incredibly disappointed, I doubt George R R Martin had much to do with the scripts/plot and I'm sure he can't be happy with the result. 10/10 for the first few seasons, 3/10 for the last one.There were also a couple of things in the previous season which were a big letdown, like explaining where the bad guys came from, and some characters were massively underused, or their story arc just seemed to tail off when the had been so promising.Overall definitely worth watching but prepare yourself for disappointment towards the end.	read book year series come bite dubious would translate screen see hbo ease worry make superb program finally get watch superb first scene excellent cast act stay close book good programme tv year problem series overtake book since go downhill especially final series massive battle incredible find real let episode even bad character well develop year suddenly act way bizarre incredibly disappoint doubt george r r martin much script plot sure happy result first season last one also couple thing previous season big letdown like explain bad guy come character massively underused story arc seem tail promise overall definitely worth watch prepare disappointment towards end
2	"The first 8 episode season of Fallout is great in so many ways. The series is super fun! It's sci-fi, fantasy style is perfect for this un-realistic, retro-futuristic nuclear fallout setting. The story and character building is done quick, but still feels deep and attaches meaning to the characters backstories before we meet them. The series quickly develops character that we are attached to without even knowing why.The bounty hunter, Cooper Howard, is introduced early in the first episode and ends up as these nuclear-radiated, immortal bounty hunter. While we don't quite know his motives, we are attracted to his unwinding storyline of hurting whoever gets in his way until we learn of his true motives.This series is unique and well done. It's a fun watch but also with meaning and potential behinds it characters Lucy, Maximus, and even Norm.

1	"I'm an old school Fallout fan, meaning I appreciate more the Black Isle Studios era of the game. I watched the series, but it felt a bit like it was written by AI. Many member-berries to please gaming community, showcasing game mechanics which is out of place in the TV show (bullet time, stimpacks etc.) Scenario is very gamey, which is to be expected on one hand, but lackluster on the other as this is not the same media or experience.Characters (Maximus strikes me as ""Finn"" ) and writing are quite superficial, enough for a game, but could be better for a drama/series. Humor is supposed to be dark and witty ( think Monty Python Easter eggs, Harold, Sulik, terminal logs...) and to me it comes out short - to banal and too shallow.Too many irrelevant, boring and repeated scenes, too little character building/drama (exception being Cooper Howard ...) Scenario is also a bit awkward as it is placed too far into the future to be plausible (160 or so years after Fallout 1, and within same geographic region). Whatever happened to the water chip?"	old school fallout fan mean appreciate black isle studio era game watch series feel bite like write ai many member berry please game community showcase game mechanic place tv show bullet time stimpack etc scenario gamey expect one hand lackluster media experience character maximus strike finn write quite superficial enough game could well drama series humor suppose dark witty think monty python easter egg harold sulik terminal log come short banal shallow many irrelevant bore repeat scene little character build drama exception cooper howard scenario also bite awkward place far future plausible year fallout within geographic region whatever happen water chip
2	I love the Fallout game series. I have been playing them for decades. I love the post-apocalyptic world. I love the back story and glimpses into the past. I've always said the Fallout world would make a great movie or TV show. But, if the past is any indication, it would not do the games justice. Except this series. I was blown away by the attention to detail. It's like they mirrored the game to the screen. I felt like I was playing another iteration of my favorite franchise. Story was a bit slow in the beginning, but quickly picked up the pace. Love the bits of humor thrown in just like the games. But also is equally dystopian in all it's glory. Would love more of Inon Zur's original music from the games, there is a taste of it here and there, but I would love to hear more. With all the positive feedback, I am confident this will get picked up for more seasons. Keep em coming, I love it.	love fallout game series play decade love post apocalyptic world love back story glimpse past always say fallout world would make great movie tv show past indication would game justice except series blow away attention detail like mirror game screen feel like play another iteration favorite franchise story bite slow begin quickly pick pace love bit humor throw like game also equally dystopian glory would love inon zur original music game taste would love hear positive feedback confident get pick season keep em come love
1	Let me start by saying I have not read any material or watched anything on this but know it's regarded as the best science fiction ever written. So with that being said I have no skin in the game but expected in a way greatness to be shown to me. I'm left underwhelmed and kind of disappointed. To the average consumer that is like me thats has no clue about anything on this subject, I wanted to get introduced into something amazing and understand the genius of it but I'm left uninspired. There wasn't nearly enough science explained or shown and although the first 2 episodes hook you in with a murder mystery and even a mystery of who is trying to solve the murders, the breakdown of all science which still didn't clarify or dive into, the countdown, the video game and overall tone felt exciting and I wanted to see more of that but it quickly disappears or is resolved. These group of friends that are supposed to be some of earth's brightest seem to have a boring teenage drama about them or just uniteresting character development or story besides maybe 2 of them. It's greatest parts were the Chinese flashback story and the early mystery of everything then it quickly becomes a humanity vs aliens with not enough to keep it alfoat of curiosity. It's called 3 body problem (in which they figure out and don't dive into and move on from completely) but it really is more of * Oxford 5* problem.	let start say read material watch anything know regard good science fiction ever write say skin game expect way greatness show leave underwhelmed kind disappoint average consumer like that s clue anything subject want get introduce something amaze understand genius leave uninspired nearly enough science explain show although first episode hook murder mystery even mystery try solve murder breakdown science still clarify dive countdown video game overall tone feel excite want see quickly disappear resolve group friend suppose earth brightest seem bore teenage drama unitereste character development story besides maybe great part chinese flashback story early mystery everything quickly become humanity vs alien enough keep alfoat curiosity call body problem figure dive move completely really oxford problem

However, I couldn't bare to watch any more raw cruelty and let's be honest, I wasn't ready to read thru the entire show of subtitles like it's some obscure foreign film on Netflix. I tend to prefer shows that are more for a general audience, nothing extreme. But this show is exactly that. Extreme and hard to watch. Not a good choice if you just want to chill at home after work and follow a good story. Between having to read thru the entire episode and watching families be murdered and some dude get boiled alive, ummm no thanks.

1	I'm thru episode 1 and part way thru 2. I felt the need to jump on this and comment.Everything is very much on point. Except one excruciatingly annoying aspect. The character Auggie Salazar, she needs to take a happy pill and quit being such a B. Every time, and I mean every time another character engages with her she gives them the cold shoulder. Even if she invites someone to come see her. She'll act like they are a nuisance and wishes they weren't there bothering her. It's old and played out at this point. I really hope the director changes that as I proceed.I don't know if it's bad acting or the inability to act and have any depth so she does the only thing she knows how to do - act like B. Like those kids in school that hated when a teacher called on them or tried joking around to lighten up the mood. The kid is shy, but instead acts out because that's all he knows. Well I'm not seeing any acting ability in her part at all. It's like B-level horror movie acting with the damsel as the lead. No substance. Just pretty screams and stupid attempts at having emotionsI'd consider two more stars if that were minimized at this point but B-force is strong with this one.	thru episode part way thru feel need jump comment everything much point except one excruciatingly annoy aspect character auggie salazar need take happy pill quit b every time mean every time another character engage give cold shoulder even invite someone come see act like nuisance wish bother old play point really hope director change proceed know bad act inability act depth thing know act like b like kid school hat teacher call try joke around lighten mood kid shy instead act know well see act ability part like b level horror movie act damsel lead substance pretty scream stupid attempt emotionsi consider two star minimize point b force strong one

1	... the first 4 episodes really had me but after that I was ready for the season to be done. Why do you have to make a season unnecessarily longer than it needs to be? I really was exhausted when I watched the last 4 episodes. They could've cut off at least 2 characters by then! Mostly because the book is (of course) so different with the characters. Season 2 already sounds exhausting to me, unfortunately. Still I think this is a great science fiction show and I hope that more shows like this will he made! Just with the more important things in mind and cutting off all the unnecessary parts. For me it is still a must see, but take your time and be patient.	first episode really ready season do make season unnecessarily long need really exhaust watch last episode could cut least character mostly book course different character season already sound exhaust unfortunately still think great science fiction show hope show like make important thing mind cut unnecessary part still must see take time patient
0	It seems the days of good fantasy are now dead forever. Gone are the worlds of magic and mysticism to be replaced by graphic sex and even more graphic violence. Tolkien and Lewis are doing somersaults in their respective graves. Now we have lots of violent battle scenes interrupted by dull, soap-opera-like pedantry. And while it may be technically impressive in it's many cartoon-like computer graphics, the actual writing and acting are embarrassingly bad. One can only feel pity for otherwise good actors like Charles Dance and the great Diana Rigg. As to the stories, they are exceedingly dull and totally unimaginative...By the way, I have trudged through 4 seemingly interminable seasons hoping it might get better, only to be seriously disappointed...and the seasons are only 10 episodes!!!	seem day good fantasy dead forever go world magic mysticism replace graphic sex even graphic violence tolkien lewis somersault respective grave lot violent battle scene interrupt dull soap opera like pedantry may technically impressive many cartoon like computer graphic actual write act embarrassingly bad one feel pity otherwise good actor like charles dance great diana rigg story exceedingly dull totally unimaginative way trudge seemingly interminable season hop might get well seriously disappoint season episode
1	I'm into the second season of this show. It's pretty enjoyable. Here's the good news. I like the casual mix of race, I like that a lot. It doesn't seem forced. I love Chandra Wilson as 'the Nazi' who is in charge of our ingénue doctors (or interns as they are apparently known as in the trade). I love that she is not tall and willowy, love that she is who she is. Chandra Wilson is the star of this show, a wonderful actress. Go Chandra. Also find myself getting to like the pretty blonde Izzy, who despite the drawback of being yet another pretty blonde, is managing to rise above that. The writers have given her more dimension and she is shining in a quiet way. Also the jock intern, Alex is showing up in the 2nd season as having more going on and that is a pleasure to watch. What is really getting on my nerves is the shows namesake, Meredith Grey. Here we have the Sarah Jessica Parker narrator. She is the weakest link. played by Ellen Pompeo she is all big eyes and sulky pout. Her persona has worn completely thin for me. She is all sulk. That is her personality. Stand there, widen the eyes, pout. Writers, give her some bite. Well, some personality. Any personality. Why does she have to moon after the attending surgeon, played by Patrick Dmpey? If she is into one night stands give her some. Her character seems so foggy, maybe that is the point, she is foggy. Maybe we are supposed to find her and her stuff completely boring? Perhaps that is one of the points of the show. Di d I mention the show is set in a hospital? The OR room I think, I'm not a doctor, not a nurse so, I do not know for sure. It doesn't really matter. It is just a vehicle to watch these characters shuffle around each other in Seattle or Portland somewhere like that, though it is probably shot on Burbank of Canada. They could be graphic designers or gardeners. It so happens the genre is hospital, they play doctor, but that is it. It's just playing. I still watch this show, it is distracting. There's some fun performances, Sandra Oh not bad playing a bit of a cliché, know it all, no heart type intern doctor, gets a bit old but hey she gets to be the mean one which is fun, fun to be the bad gal. Isiah Washington, better in the 2nd series. Eh, you know, show set in hospital, cast play doctors, central character really boring, surrounding cast better.

0	This has been one of the most depressing turn of events of late. What was easily a 9+ rated serial and seen such a major fall that it's almost unbelievable something like this (season 8) could actually be written by those who are supposed to write the grand finale of something really as grand as GoT.It's as if someone was hell bent on burning the legacy of GoT to the ground (much like the burning of King's Landing) - all carefully crafted character arcs thrown down the drain, strange and totally uncalled-for character turns, sloppy writing, and sloppy production as well (Is it some coincidence that only in Season 8 we see a coffee cup on the table?).This series deserved so much better. Perhaps the writers and directors should learn something from the makers of Breaking Bad, True Detective, The Wire etc. The ending of any series is a golden opportunity for the writers and directors to send themselves to glory - but here the team has probably made sure that no one ever employs them again.	one depress turn event late easily rat serial see major fall almost unbelievable something like season could actually write suppose write grand finale something really grand get someone hell bend burn legacy get grind much like burn king land carefully craft character arc throw drain strange totally uncalled character turn sloppy write sloppy production well coincidence season see coffee cup table series deserve much well perhaps writer director learn something maker break bad true detective wire etc end series golden opportunity writer director send glory team probably make sure one ever employ

Because what society deems to be ""better"" is not what they truly desire.I got through the first season in one sitting as it fully grabbed my attention.

0	The lack of colour made everything feel drab and lifeless. I mean, how am I supposed to get invested in a show when it looks like it was filmed in the 1950s? It's 2024, for crying out loud!

0	Are you ready for a couple of hot actresses and dorky actors trying to solve their love lives ? I half expected the Friends theme song to play whenever the «Oxford 5» mer up and for them them to start talking about Instagram likes . Pretty much no Chinese actors , the plots been dumbed down and all the female actors are are actors/models . On a more serious note the show struggles with what it wants to be . A show for teenage social media or for fans of the book. The two dont mix and it shows. The only good things about this show are the Chinese revolution and aftermath parts . Those are also the parts most resembling the books.	ready couple hot actress dorky actor try solve love live half expect friend theme song play whenever oxford mer start talk instagram like pretty much chinese actor plot dumbe female actor actor model serious note show struggle want show teenage social medium fan book two do not mix show good thing show chinese revolution aftermath part also part resemble book

1	This series starts off great with loads of promise. When I seen it was made by the same people who made Game of Thrones I thought, I'm in for a ride.By the last few episodes it just seems dragged out, boring and cringey. They could have fit it into 5 episodes really as I felt myself losing interest during the last 3 episodes.In the end it just turns into your typical, boring, 'safe the world' series where everything is hinging on a small team of 'heroes'.I would rate the first 5 episodes as 8/10 and the last 3 episodes as 3/10. I wouldn't bother watching it if I knew how it was going to turn out. Save your time.	series start great load promise see make people make game throne think ride last episode seem drag bore cringey could fit episode really feel lose interest last episode end turn typical bore safe world series everything hinge small team hero would rate first episode last episode bother watch know go turn save time
0	Despite the good actors and attractive beginning, unfortunately, the scenario and the story are extremely far-fetched and illogical. I only saw the beginning of the first episode and I have a big question mark as to how they opened the gate without going through a simple security protocol to make sure there are no killers and looters on the other side. I don't even open the door to my house without making sure who is behind the door, how come they didn't care and just pushed a button to open the gate? I'm giving it two stars just because it's called Fallout. If you are going to make a series based on one of the most popular video games, please take it seriously.	despite good actor attractive begin unfortunately scenario story extremely far fetch illogical saw begin first episode big question mark open gate without go simple security protocol make sure killer looter side even open door house without make sure behind door come care push button open gate give two star call fallout go make series base one popular video game please take seriously

1	Thank you for your request to make the review of a TV show more readable. Here is a revised version that may meet your needs: Man, I really wanted to enjoy this show. But man is it hard.. One aspect of television shows that I value immensely is when characters are believable and their actions have consequences that impact the plot. In Fallout, however, the characters seem to be playing roles rather than genuine people.The turret scene had me actually in tears. It captured the essence of what plagues the show as a whole. Instead of writing a more believable escape, let's have a minigun miss 120 rounds from only 10 meters away because it looks really cool.	thank request make review tv show readable revise version may meet need man really want enjoy show man hard one aspect television show value immensely character believable action consequence impact plot fallout however character seem play role rather genuine people turret scene actually tear capture essence plague show whole instead write believable escape let minigun miss round meter away look really cool

1	First 5 seasons are simply masterpieces another 2 are not as good but still better than most other shows. However last season is a disappointment which will make you feel like the whole show was waste of your time.10/10 for season 1-7, 0/10 for season 8. One could argue that season 8 does not deserve 0/10 because it had great actors, cinematography, etc. But you know what? Yes, a single thing can ruin everything else. And it did.	first season simply masterpiece another good still well show however last season disappointment make feel like whole show waste time season season one could argue season deserve great actor cinematography etc know yes single thing ruin everything else
2	Its mostly a really good show. It adapted the source insanely well, both in aestethic and feel. Anyone who's played the games will probably love this by default as its not just easter egg based references but actually manages to recreate the atmosphere nearly perfectly.Visually its a 10/10 adaptation, the music is mostly from the games which is the best decision they could have made and most of the actors are great in their roles.So why not a 10 ?Take away the nostalgia and the already existing world to build on and the plot itself is mid at best. Its on par with some of the ingame lore you'll get from playing the games. The action pieces are somewhat lacking at times imo. And while the acting is good, some of the characters are just ... bland and uninteresting and spend an awful lot of time just staring at stuff in confusion.Given the stakes set up and the asumed danger around every corner of the wasteland, the amont of time spend just standing around in confusion just does not fit and took me out of it many times througout the show. Especially Maximus but other characters as well.Its fine to get calm moments, but the show got plenty as is and it just doesn't seem right that every character seems to need a moment of deep thought (which is not interesting to look at from a cinematic perspective either if you do it 3 times each episode) in order to decide basicly anything.I get what they tried doing but it just doesn't work imo.	mostly really good show adapt source insanely well aestethic feel anyone play game probably love default easter egg base reference actually manage recreate atmosphere nearly perfectly visually adaptation music mostly game good decision could make actor great role take away nostalgia already exist world build plot mid good par ingame lore get play game action piece somewhat lack time imo act good character bland uninteresting spend awful lot time star stuff confusion give stake set asume danger around every corner wasteland amont time spend stand around confusion fit take many time througout show especially maximus character well fine get calm moment show get plenty seem right every character seem need moment deep think interest look cinematic perspective either time episode order decide basicly anything get try work imo
2	I don't know enough about Japanese history to be able to comment on its accuracy, so this review is just about the entertainment aspect.Two episodes in and I'm hooked. I love the writing, casting, directing, cinematography, the plot(s), the balance of CGI/sets, soundtrack and pace. It's even made me want to go and learn about 17th Century Japan in detail.I have few criticisms of it, but if I were to pick a main one, then it would be the speed that some of the key players are introduced. Being the ignorant Westerner that I am, it's a bit of a struggle early doors to keep up with all the names and places.If you don't mind something that's, at times, a bit brutal and if you're better able than me to keep up with the names, then I think this is well worth a watch and highly recommended it.	know enough japanese history able comment accuracy review entertainment aspect two episode hook love write cast direct cinematography plot balance cgi set soundtrack pace even make want go learn th century japan detail criticism pick main one would speed key player introduce ignorant westerner bite struggle early door keep name place mind something time bite brutal well able keep name think well worth watch highly recommend
1	Come on. You're hunting for someone but no one asks for a picture of Richard Greenleaf? I mean the inspector was a sharp guy but his failure to ask for a picture, and the failure or Marge to volunteer one is unexplainable to me. I understand the story would have been over quickly if a picture had been provided to use in questioning every one who came in contact with Ripley. It was too big of an omission for me to completely buy into the story. Then the disguise when speaking to the inspector. Again, this took away from the entire story. Heck, he even spoke the same way with the same voice. The black and white was striking at first but I think took away from the beauty of the setting after a while. Andrew Scott did a great job. I felt he was an intelligent psychopath. I had no issues with his choice as Ripley. The show was a slow burn, maybe too long. I could have been done in 6 episodes. But p, in the end, I just wish I could forgive the lack of anyone asking for a picture.	come hunt someone one ask picture richard greenleaf mean inspector sharp guy failure ask picture failure marge volunteer one unexplainable understand story would quickly picture provide use question every one come contact ripley big omission completely buy story disguise speak inspector take away entire story heck even speak way voice black white strike first think take away beauty set andrew scott great job feel intelligent psychopath issue choice ripley show slow burn maybe long could do episode p end wish could forgive lack anyone ask picture

Why are way too many of the character in shows today written as female characters regardless of the actual sex of the character? giving lots of dialogue a ""prissy,"" ""catty"" tone that rings hollow like a soap opera? Where are the male characters speaking and acting like men do? I simply can't imagine feudal warlords having prissy repartee like modern HS students, yet ""Game of Thrones"" is full of it.

1	So today i was thinking about game of throneshonestly such a sad thing to have happened to a television showSeason 1 was rough on the edges, it looked alright but it's pretty noticeable that they didn't have the highest budget and the pilot had some issues. But the story was there, it was great. Sure its slow, but the payoffs are so heavyCome to season 2, and this show has turned into what I would consider a masterpiece. Everything from season 2 to season 4 is solidly one of the best television experiences I have seen. Genuinely I cannot begin to tell you how many payoffs there would be for every single action throughout these seasons, the intrigue and politics are phenomenal. The sets, the battles, the betrayals, certain episodes are still locked in my mind. There is not a single episode in these seasons or moment that I felt would not fit perfectly in the world and there isnt a single episode i would give lower than a Low 7/10. These 3 seasons are honestly the pinnacle of television, this is what people think of when they think of the best parts of game of thrones.Season 5 and season 6 feel like a drop in quality for me, but its not drastic, its just not as memorable. I still love these seasons and there are still epic scenes and good moments for the characters, its just lacking the source material. Some characters really lack a lot of the original personality and others become very 1 dimensional. There is cool things that happen and its still good at this point, but sometimes i wonder if they could stand as highly without the buildup of the first 4 seasons. There are a few episodes in these seasons that are just straight up kinda dull too.But everyone knows about 7 and 8. Every character that has been built up for seasons now just throws everything away. Its like the writers of the show forgot what they had written for 7 years. Seriously, everyone just flips like a coin. You could possibly have everyone change their characters personalities in the way that the show tries to do, but it has to be over a longer period of time. This is insanely rushed and doesn't feel anything like the original show i came to love. Everyone does stupid garbage, characters are killed offscreen, yeah the sets look cool but that doesn't mean anything if you're putting cinematography and sets on your poop cake story you decided to diarrhea out. Such a horrible ending to show that deserved so much more. Its not like this ending is the worst thing I've ever seen, but its more the principle that the first few seasons had extreme help from the source material... Like dang D&D, i cant believe you guys cannot write being ya know, show writers.S1 - Low 8/10S2 - High 9/10s3 - Low 10/10s4 - Low 9/10s5 - Mid 6/10s6 - Mid 6/10s7 - High 4/10s8 - Low 4/10.Overall the first 6 seasons are much worth the watch, but.... Season 7 is bad, season 8 is much worse, and honestly its really detrimental on a show this long to have such a unfulfilling ending. I cant even recommend this show cuz of the ending. Please remake the last season at least dudes. Its like you edged me for 7 years hbo and then told me to go to bed what the heck.I know that if you add all the numbers and then divide that this doesn't round out to a 6, but with such an unfulfilling ending I cant give this a 7, its not worth a 7 at the end of it all. It all leads to nothing. You wasted my time and I didnt want to just go to bed hbo.Mid 6/10.	today think game throneshonestly sad thing happen television showseason rough edge look alright pretty noticeable high budget pilot issue story great sure slow payoff heavycome season show turn would consider masterpiece everything season season solidly one good television experience see genuinely begin tell many payoff would every single action throughout season intrigue politic phenomenal set battle betrayal certain episode still lock mind single episode season moment feel would fit perfectly world be not single episode would give low low season honestly pinnacle television people think think good part game throne season season feel like drop quality drastic memorable still love season still epic scene good moment character lack source material character really lack lot original personality other become dimensional cool thing happen still good point sometimes wonder could stand highly without buildup first season episode season straight kinda dull everyone know every character build season throw everything away like writer show forget write year seriously everyone flip like coin could possibly everyone change character personality way show try long period time insanely rush feel anything like original show come love everyone stupid garbage character kill offscreen yeah set look cool mean anything put cinematography set poop cake story decide diarrhea horrible end show deserve much like end bad thing ever see principle first season extreme help source material like dang can not believe guy write ya know show writer low high low low mid mid high low overall first season much worth watch season bad season much bad honestly really detrimental show long unfulfille end can not even recommend show cuz end please remake last season least dude like edge year hbo tell go bed heck know add number divide round unfulfille end can not give worth end lead nothing waste time do not want go bed hbo mid
2	My Review- Ripley Streaming on NetflixMy Rating 8/10It's unusual for me to begin a review by praising the cinematographer but this 8 part series is a joy to watch from beginning to end it immediately reminded me of the work of the famous French photographer and film maker Henri Cartier-Bresson.The Director and writer of this adaptation Steven Zaillian was inspired by a black and white photo on the cover of his edition of The Ripley novel by Patricia Highsmith .It stayed on his mind and he thought his television adaptation would lend itself to the monochrome treatment and I think it was a great decision .The cinematographer Robert Elswit shot all episodes with Arri Alexa LF digital cameras capturing amazing definition and depth .Andrew Scott plays a more mature Tom Ripley than the previous actors that have played this character both Alain Delon and Matt Damon were in their mid twenties Andrew Scott was in his late forties when he filmed Ripley.I think he gives a fascinating new take on the character far more darker and complex than the previous fine actors who interpreted the role Alain Delon in the French movie Plein soleil or Matt Damon in the 1999 movie The Talented Mr Ripley.I wont say that Andrew Scott gives the definitive interpretation but it's certainly the most interesting his face is a canvas that constantly changes as he deceives, charms, murders when his evil deeds catch up with him . His portrayal of Tom Ripley is of a man with a thousand faces who feels a self entitlement and desire to possess the affluence and wealth of his victim Dickie Greenleaf played by Johnny Flynn.Tom Ripley flees his fraudulent lifestyle in Manhattan when his schemes unravel landing in The Italian Riviera like a cuckoo in to the nest of Dickie Greenleaf the privileged son of a wealth Baron who commissions Tom to convince his artistic playboy son to return to the family fold back in America .Tom Ripley not only has to convince Dickie Greenleaf that he knew him in America he also has to convince his suspicious girlfriend Marge Sherwood played by Dakota Fanning sister of Elle who really impressed me in this role what a talented family she belongs to.Tom Ripley is a loner and even rehearses his deceptive dialogue to with himself as he plots his strategy to convince the various characters in Dickie Greenleaf's life especially his girlfriend Marge Sherwood that he is who he says he is as he gradually wins over the trust of Dickie Greenleaf.I was less impressed with Johnny Flynn's casting as Dickie Greenleaf I thought he was dull and uninteresting but perhaps that's just what the director wanted ?The series for me started off at a little slower pace then after a few instalments it really took off at a very thrilling speed that reminded me of Alfred Hitchcock's style .In fact the whole series I thought is a tribute to the famous film-noir movies of the post war 1950's period.I looked up the definition of film noir which fits this series beautifully as a style of filmmaking characterized by such elements as cynical heroes, stark lighting effects, frequent use of flashbacks, intricate plots, and an underlying existentialist philosophy.Ripley is a well crafted series and very entertaining well worth a look in my opinion.	review ripley stream netflixmy rat unusual begin review praise cinematographer part series joy watch begin end immediately remind work famous french photographer film maker henri cartier bresson director writer adaptation steven zaillian inspire black white photo cover edition ripley novel patricia highsmith stay mind think television adaptation would lend monochrome treatment think great decision cinematographer robert elswit shoot episode arri alexa lf digital camera capture amaze definition depth andrew scott play mature tom ripley previous actor play character alain delon matt damon mid twenty andrew scott late forty film ripley think give fascinate new take character far darker complex previous fine actor interpret role alain delon french movie plein soleil matt damon movie talente mr ripley will not say andrew scott give definitive interpretation certainly interest face canvas constantly change deceive charm murder evil deed catch portrayal tom ripley man thousand face feel self entitlement desire possess affluence wealth victim dickie greenleaf play johnny flynn tom ripley flee fraudulent lifestyle manhattan scheme unravel land italian riviera like cuckoo nest dickie greenleaf privilege son wealth baron commission tom convince artistic playboy son return family fold back america tom ripley convince dickie greenleaf know america also convince suspicious girlfriend marge sherwood play dakota fan sister elle really impress role talente family belong tom ripley loner even rehearse deceptive dialogue plot strategy convince various character dickie greenleaf life especially girlfriend marge sherwood say gradually win trust dickie greenleaf less impress johnny flynn cast dickie greenleaf think dull uninteresting perhaps director want series start little slow pace instalment really take thrill speed remind alfred hitchcock style fact whole series think tribute famous film noir movie post war period look definition film noir fit series beautifully style filmmake characterize elements cynical hero stark light effect frequent use flashback intricate plot underlie existentialist philosophy ripley well craft series entertain well worth look opinion
0	"I want to like this program. I try to like it, but as a former Southern California police officer, I find too many storyline errors. It would not take much editing to make this a good ""cop show."" I am sure there is suppose to be light moments. Nobody wants to watch a depressing program that shows some of the reality of being a police officer, but with just a few changes to procedure, the program will not have to be incredibility and tactically incorrect. Sometimes even laughably ridiculous. Eg, officers come across a suspicious car with the engine running in an ally behind a closed business. A gunfight between two officers and 3 suspects insures. A two officer car arrives as cover. One of the robbers is shot. Then one officer risks his life and the life of his partner by retrieving the wounded suspect (felon) and is more concerned about giving the suspect first aid than backing up his partner. Then he leaves the gun battle to rush one of the suspects to the hospital, while is partner is shooting it out with the remaining suspects. Absurd, ridiculous and totally unrealistic. if the individual that was shot was a fellow police officer, maybe that might happen, risking your life and the lives of the other officers to render first aid to the suspect. Each episode is full of both small and major errors. Get a police officer and maybe a trauma physician as consultants. You can keep the storyline, just work on believability and realism. Maybe you could have a Hill Street Blues."	want like program try like former southern california police officer find many storyline error would take much edit make good cop show sure suppose light moment nobody want watch depress program show reality police officer change procedure program incredibility tactically incorrect sometimes even laughably ridiculous eg officer come across suspicious car engine run ally behind close business gunfight two officer suspect insure two officer car arrive cover one robber shoot one officer risk life life partner retrieve wound suspect felon concern give suspect first aid back partner leave gun battle rush one suspect hospital partner shoot remain suspect absurd ridiculous totally unrealistic individual shoot fellow police officer maybe might happen risk life live officer render first aid suspect episode full small major error get police officer maybe trauma physician consultant keep storyline work believability realism maybe could hill street blue
1	My girlfriend insisted, and continued to insist that I watch Grey's. Eventually, I gave in, and loved it. The first two seasons are gold. That's where it ends however, as the third season was simply more of the same. That should be good, right? It isn't. Some of the characters who previously annoyed me a little (notably the protagonist Merideth) have all of a sudden become so unable to establish (and maintain) a proper relationship that their stupidity makes me want to do something bad. ...Yes friends, more of the same, more of the same will-they-wont-they rubbish, which is now rolled out to encompass George and Izzy. (George by the way going from my favourite character to my least favourite within season 3). It's not as bad as all that, but I expect more development, which has not happened. I think at the base of it all is that I am now bored and annoyed with the entire cast of characters (save the Nazi, who has remained a rock throughout). Hope this helps in some way	girlfriend insist continue insist watch grey eventually give love first two season gold end however third season simply good right character previously annoy little notably protagonist merideth sudden become unable establish maintain proper relationship stupidity make want something bad yes friend will not rubbish roll encompass george izzy george way go favourite character least favourite within season bad expect development happen think base bore annoy entire cast character save nazi remain rock throughout hope help way
2	Having only seen 1 pilot episode I obviously can't fully revue this show but I can see that there has been a lot of effort put into making a good adaptation of a very interesting book.I watched the chinese tv show which is slow, dark and cumbersome but intriguing nonetheless.While this adaptation is close in narrative to the books there are obvious changes made to present this to a western audience while trying to retain the heart of the story.The pace of this show is good, its not however an action fast paced sci fi extravaganza. This is a thoughtful show where the mystery and intrigue looks like it will unravel over many episodes as we follow the characters and their Discovery's.The Chinese adaptation seemed to take a few altered political narratives and doubled down on its maths and science route often lacking an emotional connection to the viewer. Whereas in the book the emotional outlook of humanity tugs at its core.Visually everything is on point and the performances where solid, even though little was revealed it flows nicely although i can see many people wanting answers it would be a disservice to the books to do so.I am looking forward to watching the entire series and how they deal with hard to adapt science and quantum physics ideologies and tie into its core human nature plot.For some this show may be a bit niche or overwhelming for others it will be not as in depth or complex as may be hoping for.8/10 for its opening.	see pilot episode obviously fully revue show see lot effort put make good adaptation interest book watch chinese tv show slow dark cumbersome intrigue nonetheless adaptation close narrative book obvious change make present western audience try retain heart story pace show good however action fast pace sci fi extravaganza thoughtful show mystery intrigue look like unravel many episode follow character discovery chinese adaptation seem take alter political narrative double math science route often lack emotional connection viewer whereas book emotional outlook humanity tug core visually everything point performance solid even though little reveal flow nicely although see many people want answer would disservice book look forward watch entire series deal hard adapt science quantum physics ideology tie core human nature plot show may bite niche overwhelm other depth complex may hop open
1	I never played the games, so I'm watching this as objectively as I can and keeping an open mind. After watching most of the episodes, I have some mixed thoughts. There are some excellent moments that build tension and drama very well. Then there are moments that seem completely out of place. These great moments convey a graveness and severity that is almost always broken by some ill thought out joke or plot point. If you do it once unexpectedly or set it up well, it can be funny. Doing it poorly over and over just makes it seem odd and breaks the viewer's engagement.The show will put in the time to build up a critical situation, they'll show a very violent gore filled scene and then cap it off in a shallow attempt at comedy. If it was written better, it would probably have worked, but it comes off as haphazard and awkward too often. It's almost as if the writers or showrunners don't want the show to be taken too seriously or become too frightening for the audience, which is strange for a post apocalyptic drama. It also lacks consistent quality writing, flow and consistently engaging plot points that would allow it to take comedic liberties.There are some great elements. Some characters (Ghoul, Wilzig and the elder) and plot arcs are interesting. They will show a great scene then lose the momentum they just built by shifting to others that are poorly done. It is so strange to have these amazing visuals only to then be awkwardly interrupted by unnecessary moments or a weird soundtrack that is out of place. The raid in the first episode leaves so many unanswered questions and just seems so implausible and forced. The character take so many actions that don't make any sense. The 10/10 reviewers don't have any issues with the plot or show at all???The characters don't seem to question these strange inconsistencies either. Even when they do, the other characters have no answers and so they just move on as if it never happened! This is another symptom of lazy writing. I understand that they are trying to keep some mystery while building the plot, but ultimately there is too much that is glossed over or is missing entirely. There are good moments and the writing can be good but there are always a few moments every episode that leave me shaking my head.

0	Yes, the guys who made a real mess of the last seasons of Game of Thrones have, rather puzzlingly, been given another chance to make a mess of yet another great story.The series is actually quite interesting at first, it does have a number of problems but at least it's mildly entertaining. Unfortunately it becomes increasingly uninteresting after episode 4 and the weak writing spends far too much time making potentially interesting characters rather dull.What doesn't help is the casting - the only good to great actors are Liam Cunningham and Jonathan Pryce but even they can't do much with such such an ineptly written script and bad dialog. The rest of the main actors are a dull and uninspiring bunch who didn't hold my attention in any way whatsoever.So as far I'm I'm concerned that's another failed project for Weiss and Benioff.	yes guy make real mess last season game throne rather puzzlingly give another chance make mess yet another great story series actually quite interest first number problem least mildly entertain unfortunately become increasingly uninteresting episode weak write spend far much time make potentially interest character rather dull help cast good great actor liam cunningham jonathan pryce even much ineptly write script bad dialog rest main actor dull uninspiring bunch hold attention way whatsoever far concern another fail project weiss benioff
0	Too much happening and too many errors. Just watched episode 11 and it's my last. our three teams of training and rookie officers dealt with : a homeless sweep, where an officer is stuck with a needle during an attack, clearing illegal banners from windows, a case of wrongful imprisonment / elder abuse, broke up an illegal alien flop house--even making up laws for the slum lord, dealt with a vice presidential assassin, an exploding trunk full of land mines during a gun buy back, accidental shooting during a traffic accident and foiled a mercy killing. The shows climax came with two of the three teams involved in a gun fight thwarting a pot store robbery. Many tactical errors in this scene. Police officers under fire would not leave a covered position to save a wounded robber while being shot a by the other robbers. One of the teams left to rush the wounded robber to the hospital while still under fire---abandoning their fellow officers in a fire fight. The hospital bound team drove up on the sidewalk within one block of the motorcade to get to the hospital.---Had this happened the secret service would have destroyed the vehicle with a rocket. An officer shot in the left shoulder during robbery was saved by his vest Later in the hospital his right shoulder is bloody. ....The show had the fbi coordinating security----wrong the Secret Service does that. ....They even had time to make pro weed legalization claim, anti-gun statements, illustrate the plight of the elderly homeless and illegal aliens. ----They managed to accomplish this in 40 minutes. Most any one of these events would tie up a team for an entire shift.	much happen many error watch episode last three team train rookie officer deal homeless sweep officer stick needle attack clear illegal banner window case wrongful imprisonment elder abuse break illegal alien flop house even make law slum lord deal vice presidential assassin explode trunk full land mine gun buy back accidental shoot traffic accident foil mercy kill show climax come two three team involve gun fight thwart pot store robbery many tactical error scene police officer fire would leave cover position save wound robber shoot robber one team leave rush wound robber hospital still fire abandon fellow officer fire fight hospital bind team drive sidewalk within one block motorcade get hospital happen secret service would destroy vehicle rocket officer shoot leave shoulder robbery save vest later hospital right shoulder bloody show fbi coordinate security wrong secret service even time make pro weed legalization claim anti gun statement illustrate plight elderly homeless illegal alien manage accomplish minute one event would tie team entire shift
2	I binged this the first time I watched it. This is the kind of show that I didn't think Hollywood could make anymore. Packed with meaning at every turn with its pulse on the brokenness of so many. But truly not depressing or without a positive message. The ending was so pitch perfect bringing the entire saga full circle that I could do nothing but cry.As has been stated this is presumably a story about a bartender / comedian who ends up with a stalker who changes his life and helps him deal with truths in his life he couldn't face.My only quibble is that it sort of falls into some stereotypes of things that deeply trouble people but these tropes have been used a million times and I wish they would be more original on the many and varied ways people can become broken and the ways they deal with it.	binge first time watch kind show think hollywood could make anymore pack mean every turn pulse brokenness many truly depress without positive message end pitch perfect bring entire saga full circle could nothing cry state presumably story bartender comedian end stalker change life help deal truth life face quibble sort fall stereotype thing deeply trouble people trope use million time wish would original many vary way people become break way deal
0	I won't repeat what others have said, but the criticisms are oh so true. The main character is absolutely despicable, Lacking common sense, etiquette, and morals. When you're taken prisoner, for example, is it better to be a loudmouth rabble rouser, or just quietly assess the situation and figure out what's going on. He chose to be the loudmouth. People getting beheaded left and right for minor offenses, but they let this Englishman live? Ridiculous writing. The writers have him say the F word constantly, which makes teenagers watching this giggle, But it ruins it for a more discerning audience. The Portuguese Catholics and the Japanese lords have a successful trade agreement going on, and this one anti-catholic vulgar charlatan is going to change their minds overnight? The hip young women writers on this show made me give up after three episodes and go rewatch the Richard Chamberlain superior version.	repeat other say criticism oh true main character absolutely despicable lack common sense etiquette moral take prisoner example well loudmouth rabble rouser quietly assess situation figure go choose loudmouth people get behead leave right minor offense let englishman live ridiculous write writer say f word constantly make teenager watch giggle ruin discern audience portuguese catholics japanese lord successful trade agreement go one anti catholic vulgar charlatan go change mind overnight hip young woman writer show make give three episode go rewatch richard chamberlain superior version
1	I've been a fan of Nathan Fillion since back in the Firefly days. The guy has a knack for these comedy/dramas (just look at Castle), however this overall show seemed just a little too drama for my tastes. I recognize that if it was more procedural it would be a reality show, however officers constantly turning their back on suspects to discuss personal relationships is just beyond dumb. With the current political climate, this show was fortunate to already have 3 seasons under its belt, since it's almost guaranteed to not have a 4th. Now that he's been a writer/detective, a cop, and a spaceship captain/smuggler, I'll be very curious to see what Fillion pops up as next...	fan nathan fillion since back firefly day guy knack comedy drama look castle however overall show seem little drama taste recognize procedural would reality show however officer constantly turn back suspect discuss personal relationship beyond dumb current political climate show fortunate already season belt since almost guarantee th writer detective cop spaceship captain smuggler curious see fillion pop next

2	The start is a little rough. I almost gave up but once I got past the first two episodes, I really started to enjoy it. I actually found it really great the way they were able to introducecharacters that are involved in all three of the books. I particularly enjoyed Will, I thought some of the changes that they made were actually pretty smart. At first when I saw the VR headset I thought it was stupid but after considering it it made a lot of sense. I really enjoy all of the cast, particularly Jin Chang. Contrary, I really did not like the actress that played Salazar. I just could never really believe that she was a brilliant scientist, she always just look like a cover girl actress done with a shoot, and she came off quite whiny and uninspired.	start little rough almost give get past first two episode really start enjoy actually find really great way able introducecharacter involve three book particularly enjoy think change make actually pretty smart first see vr headset think stupid consider make lot sense really enjoy cast particularly jin chang contrary really like actress play salazar could never really believe brilliant scientist always look like cover girl actress do shoot come quite whiny uninspired

2	Started off funny and ended so dark. Really unexpected storyline. Very well cast, everyone in the show are excellent. I would recommend this series to everyone's. Superb writing. Script is witty, intelligent and engaging. Episode 5 was especially dark but very well produced. Some really good acting, the chemistry between the stalker and the man is incredible, and the duo was amazing. The part when the son confessed about what happened to him and the dad's response was just simply guy wrenching.The series does drag on a tad bit with the stalking but I'm only being picky at this point. The ending can lead to a season 2?	start funny end dark really unexpected storyline well cast everyone show excellent would recommend series everyone superb write script witty intelligent engage episode especially dark well produce really good act chemistry stalker man incredible duo amaze part son confess happen dad response simply guy wrench series drag tad bite stalk picky point end lead season

When I sit down to watch a show, I don't want to watch how someone thinks the world should be, I want to watch a show that promotes both men and women as we are. Maybe to some this is entertainment, but as a guy, I'd rather watch paint dry. This is why more and more men are tuning out and just focusing on sports or reruns of shows that were actually good.I'm waiting for the day when the world isn't so insane and maybe TV will be good again.

Female character Marge and inspector Ravinni were superbly played.The plot played it at good pace and the cunning and composed character demonstrated by Tom Ripley has come out well.Appreciate the depiction of the episodes through the paintings.Only if the police officer visiting Marge house at atrani would have picked snaps lying on the table. That would have nailed the plot.Must watch for those who like the slow pace plot.	series well shoot monochrome picturesque location italy shade present black white shot give unique mysterious feel character apt main character ripley play perfectly female character marge inspector ravinni superbly play plot play good pace cunne compose character demonstrate tom ripley come well appreciate depiction episode paint police officer visit marge house atrani would pick snap lie table would nail plot must watch like slow pace plot
2	I ended up binge watching the whole series within 24 hours. I would say after the first episode, I wasn't convinced that I would watch the whole series. But actually it grew on me.I'm a big fan of the Fallout game franchise, although I haven't played it in a while. I would recognise that it's not easy converting a video game story into a tv series or a movie without disappointing fans: a bit like the Assassins Creed Movie.This one actually worked. The action in the series, the way injuries and kills happen in the series, wouldn't work in a typical film or movie as it's unrealistic, only works in video games. But they kept the video game effect in the series. So it gets away with it. But that's probably because I'm a Fallout fan. I won't recommend it to any non-fallout fans as they simply won't get it.I don't usually watch tv series', as I can't get into them anymore: they require time and focus. Most series' don't catch my full attention. But this one did.I hope we won't have to wait too long for a second season.	end binge watch whole series within hour would say first episode convince would watch whole series actually grow big fan fallout game franchise although play would recognise easy convert video game story tv series movie without disappoint fan bite like assassin creed movie one actually work action series way injury kill happen series work typical film movie unrealistic work video game keep video game effect series get away probably fallout fan recommend non fallout fan simply get usually watch tv series get anymore require time focus series catch full attention one hope wait long second season
1	Overall, up until.the 7th episode I was willing to ignore the flaws and holes and felt it was a decent 7 star show. Then the last episode and a half happens and I couldnt handle the stupidity of the writing and flaws.First the positives: Aesthetic is great, really feels like an apocalyptic world.Walton Goggims is amazing. As the cowboy and the ghoul, he does an amazing job. His is also the best storyline and I wanted mote.Ella Purnell also put in a solid performance as Sarah especially when she was playing the innocent woman from the shelter. However the horrible writing in the last 2 episodes even wastes her.Now for the Bad:Maximus is a terrible character and the actor who plays him is terrible. Hated him and his storyline.Cringe Writing. If you can shut your brain off and not think about the plot, it can be quite enjoyable. I was able to do thus for 6 episodes but it was too much. Once you get to the end (last episode is by far the worst) and think about the rest of the series, it is a clown show. None of what happens makes any sense, their plans are stupid. Way too many coincidences and writing conveniences. Its a cast world yet characters continually run into each other. Certain storylines go nowhere.This show was not horrible but not good wither. A total mixed bag. The Horrific writing ultimately makes it unrecommendable by me. The shame is with a tighter plot and better writing, this could have been great. By the way, I have never played the games.	overall th episode will ignore flaw hole feel decent star show last episode half happen could not handle stupidity write flaw first positive aesthetic great really feel like apocalyptic world walton goggim amaze cowboy ghoul amaze job also good storyline want mote ella purnell also put solid performance sarah especially play innocent woman shelter however horrible write last episode even waste bad maximus terrible character actor play terrible hat storyline cringe write shut brain think plot quite enjoyable able thus episode much get end last episode far worst think rest series clown show none happen make sense plan stupid way many coincidence write convenience cast world yet character continually run certain storyline go nowhere show horrible good wither total mix bag horrific write ultimately make unrecommendable shame tight plot well write could great way never play game
0	Having read Patricia Highsmith's Ripley novels, I was looking forward to this miniseries.However, I was very disappointed. I felt that Andrew Scott as Tom Ripley was terrible casting. Ripley is a more youthful character and Andrew Scott is nearing 50 years old - and it shows.I didn't understand why the film was shot in black-and-white, particularly when a large part of the story is set in Italy which is noted for its colour and life. It seemed to be a parody of Film Noir. Too many artistic shots focusing on irrelevant pieces of scenery or props for no apparent reason. Sequences of Ripley walking along reflected in puddles and taken from weird angles for no particular reason. Perhaps the Director or cinematographer was influenced by the third man or one of Humphrey Bogart's Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade films.Any chemistry between Dickie Greenleaf and Tom Ripley seem to be completely missing in this adaptation. All the characters seem to be unlikable with very little to redeem them.Overall, I was very disappointed and I didn't finish the series.	read patricia highsmith ripley novel look forward miniserie however disappoint feel andrew scott tom ripley terrible cast ripley youthful character andrew scott near year old show understand film shoot black white particularly large part story set italy note colour life seem parody film noir many artistic shot focus irrelevant piece scenery prop apparent reason sequence ripley walk along reflect puddle take weird angle particular reason perhaps director cinematographer influence third man one humphrey bogart philip marlowe sam spade film chemistry dickie greenleaf tom ripley seem completely miss adaptation character seem unlikable little redeem overall disappoint finish series
0	I'm on ep 6 and nothing has happened. The fallout games aren't boring so why is the TV series? It's so small in comparison but theyvr completely watered everything down to suit a wider audience than sticking with the lore. Like LOTR they've mismanaged something that could have been brilliant for them. I've seen so far 1 gulper and 4 radroaches. Which makes complete sense since literally everyone complained about FO76 and I don't remember gulpers before then. It seems like a nursery ride compared to the games. The people don't see any real threats. There's 1 small group of raiders. Too much back story and not enough stuff going on in real time. Complete waste of time and money. I do like the cast. Whish is about as good as my reviews gets. Also seeing the sets brought to live is nice but that's it.	ep nothing happen fallout game bore tv series small comparison theyvr completely water everything suit wide audience stick lore like lotr mismanage something could brilliant see far gulper radroache make complete sense since literally everyone complain fo remember gulper seem like nursery ride compare game people see real threat small group raider much back story enough stuff go real time complete waste time money like cast whish good review get also see set bring live nice

1	This is no art in this for sure, not much original stuff, writing is just meh, nothing to keep you excited that much but it sort of felt good and had okay moments. Something to have as a background while you do dishes or something... But as the show goes on it just gets so cringy and filled with clichés. Line after line makes my eyes roll and every story is so predictible. All the cops are just Jessica Fletchering through L. A. bumping into crime every day on and off duty. Solving murders in minutes, getting shot at few times a day with no conequences. It just gets worse with time and I am only on season 2. I don't think I will be able to go through it until the end.

1	I enjoyed the first 4 episodes. They were intriguing and exciting. I was invested in the story and the characters (except Auggie, character does not make any sense) but then it turned into a soap opera about that guy fighthing his cancer and friends being friends and whatnot. Unecessary emotional dialogues and scenes.I enjoyed however the concept of the first 4 episodes and their intensity especially when they were inside the game. Good effects overall except for the stupid boat scene.I thought maybe finally Netflix produced something decent finally but nah.

1	There is the makings of a good show here. However the scientists are supposed to be the most intelligent people on the planet but make the most stupid decision. Furthermore they are incredibly un-likeable.The best characters are the other characters who bring some depth and interest to the show.It's also rather slow. It needs a bit faster pacing and some more interesting characters that are likeable. I hope that the second season is far more interesting and has some really good exciting episodes that raise the bar and has some really good cliff hangers and jaw dropping moments. Which is expected by these producers.	make good show however scientist suppose intelligent people planet make stupid decision furthermore incredibly un likeable good character character bring depth interest show also rather slow need bite fast pace interest character likeable hope second season far interest really good excite episode raise bar really good cliff hanger jaw drop moment expect producer

2	The cast of Firefly have all moved on to have fabulous careers. Nathan Fillion stars as John Nolan in this police procedural in a group of probationary cops each working with a training officer. Nolan is different since all the others are the conventional twenty-somethings and he is starting a second career later in life.This is an interesting proposition and the first two seasons successfully explore the dynamic of his differences - physically less able, more empathetic due to life-experience, suspicion (is it a game or is he committed). Season 3 lost its way a little as the Rookie element receded, but it has reinvented itself as more of an ensemble relationship-procedural in season 4. This added to the introduction of some new rookie characters has given it longevity.An enjoyable show, it will not win any awards, but I look out for it each week. Started with 8* downgraded to 7*.	cast firefly move fabulous career nathan fillion star john nolan police procedural group probationary cop work train officer nolan different since other conventional twenty something start second career later life interest proposition first two season successfully explore dynamic difference physically less able empathetic due life experience suspicion game commit season lose way little rookie element recede reinvent ensemble relationship procedural season add introduction new rookie character give longevity enjoyable show win award look week start downgrade
2	Too many reviews here are being unfairly critical of this newest adaptation considering the source material. There is a prior adaptation from Tencent films but no English translations just subtitles.The main characters are simplified in both origin (except Ye Winji) and interactions prior to involvement in the war. Coming from the books, what we have been given in season 1 is only a foundation of the series. There is a plethora of more to come, if the show goes through all three books (fingers crossed). There has been some backlash from Chinese news agencies who are harsh on the DEI/diversity of characters, meaning there was an extensive array of both male/female, including making book male characters into females, but also check boxing each race/ethnicity. Which is a valid argument considering the source material is almost all Chinese characters, except for Wade and the other Wallfacers.Where this show shines is the CGI! From the VR worlds of the Trisolaris, to the representation of the Sophon and the Eye in the Sky and least of all the end of Judgement Day. That episode alone was amazing from the practical effects (little paper dolls being invisibily sliced) to the grand effects (the whole ship essentially melting into a pile of scrap on the canal beach).	many review unfairly critical new adaptation consider source material prior adaptation tencent film english translation subtitle main character simplify origin except ye winji interaction prior involvement war come book give season foundation series plethora come show go three book finger cross backlash chinese news agency harsh dei diversity character mean extensive array male female include make book male character female also check box race ethnicity valid argument consider source material almost chinese character except wade wallfacer show shin cgi vr worlds trisolaris representation sophon eye sky least end judgement day episode alone amaze practical effect little paper doll invisibily slice grand effect whole ship essentially melt pile scrap canal beach

0	When will Netflix learn to quality control these directors adaptions. How many great novels will they be allowed to destroy. The speed of the plot has been rushed with no time to get to know the characters and understand the novels plot building. The casting was also very poor with the majority of the cast coming from Game of Thrones. Did they come with a knock down price as a group. I really don't understand why they need to have people smoking everywhere, are they being paid by the tobacco industry in advertising. They make it unnecessarily appealing to younger people that smoking i.e. Killing yourself is acceptable.	netflix learn quality control director adaption many great novel allow destroy speed plot rush time get know character understand novel plot build cast also poor majority cast come game throne come knock price group really understand need people smoke everywhere pay tobacco industry advertise make unnecessarily appeal young people smoke e kill acceptable

2	Did they miss the point ?I love this show, so won't mark it down but my oh my did the writers of season 8 not actually see the point of it all ?Throughout this entire show, there as only ever been one threat, the real threat. The Night King and the army of the dead. Maybe it is just my interpretation but he represented something that we can all relate to. He was the great leveller, an unstoppable force, something we ignore at our own peril. He was meant to unite them, put aside their petty squabbles and actually face the consequences of their indifference to events taking place outside of their own little worlds. He represented global warming, plastic pollution, mass extinction, ecological disasters on an unprecedented scale, wars, famine and our own indifference to it all. Warnings after warnings had been ignored and he represented pay back. Death itself come to reclaim the entire world.This story was never about the Iron Throne nor who sat on it at the end. Through meticulous character development, beautifully crafted storylines and a world steeped in history, we the viewers were drawn in. We could empathise, like, pity, loath or even love them. We, unlike many of the characters in this show could also see the bigger picture, the ever growing, ominous threat. A threat so horrific, so dreadful that many of the characters, didn't see, refused to see or simply dismissed it and this would ultimately be their downfall. This threat was not a mindless zombie horde, with no goal nor reason, it was the apocalypse. An event so terrible that no matter what had happened prior, no matter how rich, poor, cruel, kind, noble or dreadful they were, their world was doomed.Game of Thrones had one of the greatest platforms of all to get this message across. The Night King should have been allowed to sweep them all aside. Whether they were heroes or villains, it should have made no difference because the message was simple, do something before it is too late. And it was too late !!This show had everything, great settings, great actors and actresses, it even had dragons. More importantly it had the greatest threat we will ever face, us and our inability to recognise and act upon the real threat. Instead the writers of season eight decided to turn this messenger into a stereotype villain, made of ice who could easily be dispatched by a teenage girl with a knife. Girl power, wins the day !!Game of Thrones could have gone out with a huge bang, the message could easily have been put out through far better writing and following where the original storyline was actually heading. Eight seasons and nearly ten years in the making and they simply missed the point to it all.	miss point love show mark oh writer season actually see point throughout entire show ever one threat real threat night king army dead maybe interpretation represent something relate great leveller unstoppable force something ignore peril mean unite put aside petty squabble actually face consequence indifference event take place outside little world represent global warm plastic pollution mass extinction ecological disaster unprecedented scale war famine indifference warn warn ignore represent pay back death come reclaim entire world story never iron throne sit end meticulous character development beautifully craft storyline world steep history viewer draw could empathise like pity loath even love unlike many character show could also see big picture ever grow ominous threat threat horrific dreadful many character see refuse see simply dismiss would ultimately downfall threat mindless zombie horde goal reason apocalypse event terrible matter happen prior matter rich poor cruel kind noble dreadful world doom game throne one great platform get message across night king allow sweep aside whether hero villain make difference message simple something late late show everything great setting great actor actress even dragon importantly great threat ever face we inability recognise act upon real threat instead writer season eight decide turn messenger stereotype villain make ice could easily dispatch teenage girl knife girl power win day game throne could go huge bang message could easily put far well write follow original storyline actually head eight season nearly ten year make simply miss point
1	"I really thought after watching this show I was going to come back to IMDB and see a score around 6.7 or 6.8. It looks like that is not the case and by leaving a 7 star review I am going to be in the minority.Here's why I gave it that score; it has appeal to the masses but does little to actually stand out as a piece of cinema. It does capture the many fun details I wanted to see as someone who grew up playing Fallout games, but it fails to break away from the recycled Hollywood template of making a modern day television show. The acting is subpar. Most of it is bad.Walton Goggins and Moises Arias are fantastic. Ella Purnell can carry her weight but didn't particularly stand out. The guy who plays Maximus has a lot of work to do as an actor. Dogmeat did a great job.Overall, this movie felt like another ""Safeway brand"" version of a show that could have been incredibly unique and badass. Some of the scenes were so cringe and hard to watch (ie: the BHOS chanting Maximus name at the end of the show). Like I said, if you like Taylor Swift then you probably liked this show and thought it was badass. If you don't like Taylor Swift and are a cinema connoisseur, then this was enjoyable but at times hard to watch because of the extreme corniness.It was great to finally watch a respectable adaptation of a game that I spent hundreds of hours playing in my youth and still cherish today.A for the adaptation, but a C for the execution."	really think watch show go come back imdb see score around look like case leave star review go minority give score appeal mass little actually stand piece cinema capture many fun detail want see someone grow play fallout game fail break away recycle hollywood template make modern day television show act subpar bad walton goggin moises arias fantastic ella purnell carry weight particularly stand guy play maximus lot work actor dogmeat great job overall movie feel like another safeway brand version show could incredibly unique badass scene cringe hard watch ie bhos chant maximus name end show like say like taylor swift probably like show think badass like taylor swift cinema connoisseur enjoyable time hard watch extreme corniness great finally watch respectable adaptation game spend hundred hour play youth still cherish today adaptation c execution
2	A fantastic and engrossing show, and the stakes of how it begins were entirely unexpected. I was surprised by the overlap with the Protestant/Catholic divide per Spain, and Portugal as it correlated to the English and the time period tied together with this period in Japan.The pilot episode introduces a unique and interesting Englishman who quickly becomes a central character to the storyline and watching how he tries to connect when reaching Japan and being unable to bridge the gap of communication at first was both a brutal and intriguing watch.There are many layers of storyline happening at once and lots of detail specific scenes that capture various sentiments between different types of people as they are all brought into Japanese culture - or in some cases, exposed to Europeans and their empirical mindset. It's interesting to see two very different, and very technically advanced and civilized worlds meet and how their people respond during those interactions gives even more insight into the difficulties posed in life during these times, and across diverse viewpoints.	fantastic engross show stake begin entirely unexpected surprise overlap protestant catholic divide per spain portugal correlate english time period tie together period japan pilot episode introduce unique interest englishman quickly become central character storyline watch try connect reach japan unable bridge gap communication first brutal intrigue watch many layer storyline happen lot detail specific scene capture various sentiment different type people bring japanese culture case expose europeans empirical mindset interest see two different technically advance civilize world meet people respond interaction give even insight difficulty pose life time across diverse viewpoint

1	After watching all episodes of the first season all hope that some have voiced after being disappointed with the first one or two episodes are misplaced: the sequences with the young Ye Wenjie are actually one of the best parts of the series: the dark atmosphere and the intensity of the acting of Zine Tseng were a perfect fit. The contemporary crime story around the string of suicides of high profile scientists was a good continuation, not the least because it was carried by two good actors, Liam Cunningham and Benedict Wong. Wong got some more depth and complexity, because he is shown in his interactions with his son, but at the same time these parts don't seem to contribute anything to the main story. Cunningham has to play an important, but very one-dimensional character. But the whole subplot is soon finished and for the viewer the small amount of suspense contained here, is killed by showing us the solution early on. The characters are later reused in a very unconvincing and silly way, basically it seems England has only one leader figure and one police man.The contemporary story line around the group of young geniuses in England which takes up most of the screen time dropped the ball on many levels. The actors are quite uneven in their performance, but even more striking is that some of them are a good fit for their role, while others are painfully unconvincing casting decisions. Eiza González as Auggie Salazar is supposed to be a technical genius, a nerd, but she completely fails to project any cool intelligence. So in those scenes where she has to show emotions or where she is just part of a group of (totally not nerdy) friends, she is convincing, but really fails in making us believe she is an academic and scientists (her impressive beauty is probably more of an obstacle than a plus in this context). Jess Hong as Jin Cheng is much better in doing exactly that. She handles the different aspects of her character and the development of the character very well. Again, the writers are quite clumsy: Though we follow Cheng all the time with her friends, where she is a very normal, emotional and non-academic person, they add a scene with her fiance Raj and his family, where she is suddenly nerdy and socially awkward.Her love story with Alex Sharp as Will Downing is well done from both sides, and Sharp plays the melancholy, self-depracating dying man quite well too. Jovan Adepo as Saul Durand is rather pale and unmemorable. This is not helped by the fact that he is supposed to be especially intelligent, but is quite often rather slow in the uptake.The writing is painfully mediocre. The story centers on some great ideas, but the writers didn't trust the audience to find them interesting enough to tag along, so they filled the screen time up with uninteresting love stories and a lot of moral discussions which don't lead to anything but some self-righteous noise. They don't care about the main plot points at all, probably because they were a given: Why is the distortion of research in physics such a problem? What are the results of the public knowledge of the existence of aliens and of their coming?As we all know, the series is based on one of the best Science Fiction publications of the 21st Century. The novels tell a very wide-ranging story in a scientifically sound manner and always amaze the reader by taking a very broad view. Scientific considerations play just as much a role as sociological ones. All of this is mind-expanding in the best sense of the word. So much intellectuality is of course unacceptable for a television series. But the fact that the authors of the series then cut out so much that the most important plot points are almost incomprehensible, but instead a sweet mash of romance and morality is stirred in, is unnecessary and cannot be excused by the requirements of a television series.All in all this series tells a story, mainly about a group of very beautiful young people and how complicated their love life is. There are also some aliens in it and some incomprehensible stuff about physics, but it is not a lot, so don't worry.	watch episode first season hope voice disappoint first one two episode misplace sequence young ye wenjie actually one good part series dark atmosphere intensity act zine tseng perfect fit contemporary crime story around string suicide high profile scientist good continuation least carry two good actor liam cunningham benedict wong wong get depth complexity show interaction son time part seem contribute anything main story cunningham play important one dimensional character whole subplot soon finish view small amount suspense contain kill show we solution early character later reuse unconvincing silly way basically seem england one leader figure one police man contemporary story line around group young genius england take screen time drop ball many level actor quite uneven performance even strike good fit role other painfully unconvincing cast decision eiza gonz lez auggie salazar suppose technical genius nerd completely fail project cool intelligence scene show emotion part group totally nerdy friend convince really fail make we believe academic scientist impressive beauty probably obstacle plus context jess hong jin cheng much well exactly handle different aspect character development character well writer quite clumsy though follow cheng time friend normal emotional non academic person add scene fiance raj family suddenly nerdy socially awkward love story alex sharp down well do side sharp play melancholy self depracating die man quite well jovan adepo saul durand rather pale unmemorable help fact suppose especially intelligent quite often rather slow uptake write painfully mediocre story center great idea writer trust audience find interest enough tag along fill screen time uninteresting love story lot moral discussion lead anything self righteous noise care main plot point probably give distortion research physics problem result public knowledge existence alien come know series base one good science fiction publication st century novel tell wide range story scientifically sound manner always amaze reader take broad view scientific consideration play much role sociological one mind expand good sense word much intellectuality course unacceptable television series fact author series cut much important plot point almost incomprehensible instead sweet mash romance morality stir unnecessary excuse requirement television series series tell story mainly group beautiful young people complicate love life also alien incomprehensible stuff physics lot worry
0	Although based on a real story nothing of this feels remotely authentic. The set ups of the missions/cases are mostly ludicrous and still basically everyone messes up even the easiest tasks and operates against what they preached just scenes before and/or throws every last bit of common sense out the cop car window. The plot twists and revelations in the not-case-related backstories of the leads are badly executed both script- and acting-wise. The leads themselves are not particularly likeable either. This is the cop-equivalent to the medicine/treatment displayed in shows like greys anatomy. No idea how this got even a second season.	although base real story nothing feel remotely authentic set up mission case mostly ludicrous still basically everyone mess even easy task operate preach scene throw every last bite common sense cop car window plot twist revelation case relate backstorie lead badly execute script act wise lead particularly likeable either cop equivalent medicine treatment display show like grey anatomy idea get even second season

2	Let me get this out of the way by just saying WOW! The set design and attention to detail is amazing, and they really outdone themselves. Now, regarding the three main characters? I think its paced fantastically for me, the tone with being goofy and weird but then serious is a really good way to pace a show especially when thats fallout's aesthetic. I don't believe there was a single episode (except maybe the vault 4 plotline, which really didn't need to happen). Now for the important part: is it faithful to the source material?Well... Quickfire about things that don't make sense compared to the games: >Shady Sands is not located in the LA >The Boneyard does not have the 700000 ncr citizens it boasted about in Fallout 2 >The Master (Antagonist of fallout 1 who tracked down vaults) is never mentioned in this show at all, his HQ was in LA and its never explained why Vault 4 or Vault 33 were not discovered by him >The Brotherhood of Steel becoming the most powerful faction in the region with seemingly no explanation?(This one could be a mistake or actually tremendously bad for the canon) In one of the episodes its explained that in 2277 began the fall of Shady Sands then a arrow pointing to a nuclear explosion. NV takes place in 2281, so if Shady Sands was destroyed in 2277 it DE canonizes NV completely. However, its shown that their is a year below each of the events in Shady Sands timeline but not one under the explosion, they could easily fix this mistake. Great show overall but it has a lot of lore problems regarding the NCR.	let get way say wow set design attention detail amaze really outdo regard three main character think pace fantastically tone goofy weird serious really good way pace show especially that s fallout aesthetic believe single episode except maybe vault plotline really need happen important part faithful source material well quickfire thing make sense compare game shady sand locate la boneyard ncr citizen boast fallout master antagonist fallout track vault never mention show hq la never explain vault vault discover brotherhood steel become powerful faction region seemingly explanation one could mistake actually tremendously bad canon one episode explain begin fall shady sand arrow point nuclear explosion nv take place shady sand destroy de canonize nv completely however show year event shady sand timeline one explosion could easily fix mistake great show overall lot lore problem regard ncr
1	Grey's Anatomy started well, but with the time characters became stupid, impatient and sex hungry. The creator of the series decided to give room to gay people but I find it hypocritical the way they are depicted. The hospital gay employees are lesbians and the patients are male gays. So, it seems that it's OK to watch lesbians kissing and making out in bed. But I guess American viewership is not ready to see males kissing and romping, because none of the main male characters are gay, only the patients that come and go. Funny thing, a gay in real life actor in the series was outed as gay and he left the show. I like the racial diversity but the violent subjects seem to be white only.I hope when the Grey's Anatomy ends, there won't be any regret of not ending it sooner due to the weak script of the latter seasons.	grey anatomy start well time character become stupid impatient sex hungry creator series decide give room gay people find hypocritical way depict hospital gay employee lesbian patient male gay seem ok watch lesbian kiss make bed guess american viewership ready see male kiss romp none main male character gay patient come go funny thing gay real life actor series out gay leave show like racial diversity violent subject seem white hope grey anatomy end regret end soon due weak script latter season
2	I just finished binge watching the show. It's not an easy watch. It started out a little lighter but the more it progressed the harder it was to watch. Sexual abuse, mental illness, self destruction and trauma are some of the things that you'll see in the show. It's disturbing to think this is a true story.The acting is phenomenal! I was very impressed with it. You can feel the raw emotion and stress that is going on in the lives of those people. I just can't get past the fact that it's a true story. There's a lot of mental illness and trauma involved. Makes you feel so bad for them.

2	"This is episode 2 out of 6. The first episode was kinda meh, the show-runners wasted a lot of time on stereotypical Hollywood fillers you would expect from a second-tier police procedural, but sure, a little reunion here and there wasn't totally superfluous.However, episode 2 is like a badly written version of episode 1, and unexpectedly took the use of fillers to a whole new level, a level unacceptable for GOT. The writers must have really run of ideas to do what is essentially a clip show. Again, this is something you would expect from the last season of Friends or the Office when the main characters would sit around and reminisce about ""remember when you did this and I did that, those were the days, and we've all grown so much since then."" And Arya, are you kidding me? Even though it was foreshadowed like crazy in episode 1, I still had some hope they wouldn't completely destroy years of character development with one gratuitous scene. My god, what a waste of an episode, the Sand Snakes don't look so bad now.Well, at least we can expect a CGI battle next week, I guess we'll see how it goes, but I honestly didn't expect the show to deteriorate to such an extent this season."	episode first episode kinda meh show runner waste lot time stereotypical hollywood filler would expect second tier police procedural sure little reunion totally superfluous however episode like badly write version episode unexpectedly take use filler whole new level level unacceptable get writer must really run idea essentially clip show something would expect last season friend office main character would sit around reminisce remember day grow much since arya kid even though foreshadow like crazy episode still hope completely destroy year character development one gratuitous scene god waste episode sand snake look bad well least expect cgi battle next week guess see go honestly expect show deteriorate extent season

Nothing of interest and even without the black and white, everything is so drab and lifeless; including all the characters. Scott was great as Moriarty but here he's just another boring dude amongst many boring dudes. On the plus side if you're having trouble sleeping then is the choice show for you. I have to laugh at the ponderous, praising reviews which are sheer lunacy. There is not one moment of entertainment in the first episode and I certainly won't see the rest.

1	8.2? That's a huge exaggeration. Shows like Breaking Bad or Ripley have that rating. The series is okay, it tells an interesting story and addresses important issues, but it's often tedious and tiring. There's too much of the author's self-expression, his reflections and musings. Watching it, I get the feeling that aside from all his complexes and problems, he's just a narcissist. It was exhausting. And it definitely could have been a movie. I love psychological thrillers, and my guilty pleasure is stories about stalkers, yet with this one, I fell asleep twice and fast-forwarded through tiresome or boring scenes three times.	huge exaggeration show like break bad ripley rat series okay tell interest story address important issue often tedious tire much author self expression reflection muse watch get feel aside complex problem narcissist exhaust definitely could movie love psychological thriller guilty pleasure story stalker yet one fall asleep twice fast forward tiresome bore scene three time
2	"The show is amazing. Beautiful, but, is so disappointing see the characters speaking in Japanese asking for Portuguese interpreters and what you hear is English. So, if you want to be accurate, putting Japanese characters speaking Japanese, why not do the same with Portuguese characters? Since the show targets to be so well portrayed in the particular period, the lack of Portuguese language is disrespectful. Or, should everyone speaks English and simplified the plot related to language barriers. Unfortunately, as a Portuguese speaker, is very strange hearing ""Portuguese"" in English... And I'll not mention the Spanish speaking ""Spanish""... So, it hit the post of great, but still worth to watch it ( and it's way easier if you don't speak Portuguese at all)."	show amaze beautiful disappoint see character speak japanese ask portuguese interpreter hear english want accurate put japanese character speak japanese portuguese character since show target well portray particular period lack portuguese language disrespectful everyone speak english simplify plot relate language barrier unfortunately portuguese speaker strange hear portuguese english mention spanish speak spanish hit post great still worth watch way easy speak portuguese

But even when compared to the Chinese version, it falls short in terms of storytelling, pacing, character development, narrative comprehension, and thematic focus. There are numerous instances where not only does it fail to respect the principles of the novel, but it also muddles even the most basic of logic.Can someone explain to me why we have characters like Auggie Salazar, Will Downing, Saul Durand, Jack Rooney and Raj Varma? Bringing negative effect to this show is the purpose?It's hard to fathom how such a promising novel could be translated into something like this.	fortunate reader original novel liu cixin devote fan series help feel thoroughly disappoint adaptation compare tv show original novel worthy everyone rtead book would agree even compare chinese version fall short term storytelle pace character development narrative comprehension thematic focus numerous instance fail respect principle novel also muddle even basic logic someone explain character like auggie salazar down saul durand jack rooney raj varma bring negative effect show purpose hard fathom promise novel could translate something like
0	"Game of Thrones used to be one of my favourite shows on television. It was the perfect fantasy story with complex and detailed stories with characters that you actually cared about, along with simply fantastic writing and good acting with a great sense of tension. However, ever since Season 4 ended, the show has taken a rather significant hit in quality, and it soon went from being fantastic to good and then good to straight up idiotic. While Season 5 and 6 weren't the worst, and Season 7 didn't really have my blood boiling, there was a definitely recognisable change in the writing and plots. It stopped being as sophisticated and became straight up average. All that was saving it was the other good things about the show like the visuals, characters, tension and drama. But now we're here, at the final season:Game of Thrones Season 8 is one of the worst seasons of any TV show I have ever watched in my entire life. It throws everything you ever cared about with this show out the window for cheap expectation subversions, it completely shatters and throws aside character arcs that you have wanted resolved, it completely destroys many of the characters you once loved, the writing has gotten to a whole new level of atrocious with D&D giving excuses like ""Oh they just forgot about them"" to justify it, it is filled with plot holes and contrivances, ex-machinas, and so many impressively dumb moments and deaths that make The Last Jedi look like Citizen Kane. This is The Last Jedi of GOT, it ruins everything you have ever loved about it, it disregards the fact that you have loved this show for nearly a decade just so it can get away with wrapping up the story in a way that even the actors of the damn show hate.I have never seen a TV show get affected by Seasonal rot THIS HARD. A once truly terrific show bogged down due to horrible writing, and they're not even going to up their game for the ending. Years of watching this show that I'll never be able to get back.

1	"3 body problem is an interesting sci-fi premise wherein a advanced alien civilization has telegraphed their intentions to conquer earth in 400 years time, and have sent omnipotent spy computers to watch our every move as well as to engage in psychological warfare, in an effort to claim earth for themselves.After a decent first three episodes, the show falls off a cliff, there are casting problems, writing problems, such as why are British involved? Britian has no space program in real life, no natural resources etc. If Aliens arrived Britain would be a trivial country, - so poor scifi there as its not realistic in the slightest.Then there are two women cast in important roles as leading scientists, one of the actors has had obvious cosmetic surgery and is sporting pornstar lips, while being cast as having invented some gobbldygook mcguffin weapon, its ludicrous. The other scientist is poorly developed and is herself just a mcguffin for the cancer sidestory.Oh yeah, there's a cancer death, long and drawn out, so you can enjoy that ride.The final ""twist"" is that a somewhat disinterested scientist is given immense power by the UN (How exactly?) to prepare earth for invasion. I found this to be very lazy and really the second half of the show just never really picks up.If Aliens did as the show premised, then it would have been interesting to see how the UN achieves it's new immense power, to supercede laws and assume a role as World Government, but the show thinks you are a bit dim, so they just did it OK? Also hilarious to see the UN Secretary Gen cast as an American black lady. In the end this is a muddled show, with pacing and writing issues. The writing is dumbed down, as is to be expected by contemporary cinema, and the plot with the ultimately facile cancer story started to drone on about half way through.No real standout performances, but couldn't get over the British Royal Navy (who can't even float an air craft carrier) getting involved. Britian in the 21st century is not a Naval, Space, or geopolitical force, so it was a tough ask to believe the fantasy that the Royal Navy would have any real role, or humanist intention for that matter. Perhaps if the show was made 15 years ago this would have been a plausible scifi outcome, but unfortunately it seems really really dated. The most important goverments in the event of an Alien invasion would be the US, China, Russia, Brazil, India, and Australia. Tiny countries like the UK and Estonia would just be hangers on the to decisions and actions taken by Great Power countries, and I was surprised to see this ""adaptation"" stretch credulity like that when there is, to be fair, lots of juicy scifi concepts all over the show - probably its biggest strength. More needed to happen this season, and ultimately the show disappoints despite having lots of potential."	body problem interest sci fi premise wherein advance alien civilization telegraph intention conquer earth year time send omnipotent spy computer watch every move well engage psychological warfare effort claim earth decent first three episode show fall cliff cast problem write problem british involve britian space program real life natural resource etc alien arrive britain would trivial country poor scifi realistic slight two woman cast important role lead scientist one actor obvious cosmetic surgery sport pornstar lip cast invent gobbldygook mcguffin weapon ludicrous scientist poorly develop mcguffin cancer sidestory oh yeah cancer death long draw enjoy ride final twist somewhat disintereste scientist give immense power un exactly prepare earth invasion find lazy really second half show never really pick alien show premise would interest see un achieve new immense power supercede law assume role world government show think bite dim ok also hilarious see un secretary gen cast american black lady end muddle show pace write issue write dumbe expect contemporary cinema plot ultimately facile cancer story start drone half way real standout performance get british royal navy even float air craft carrier get involve britian st century naval space geopolitical force tough ask believe fantasy royal navy would real role humanist intention matter perhaps show make year ago would plausible scifi outcome unfortunately seem really really date important goverment event alien invasion would us china russia brazil india australia tiny country like uk estonia would hanger decision action take great power country surprise see adaptation stretch credulity like fair lot juicy scifi concept show probably big strength need happen season ultimately show disappoint despite lot potential
2	It's not often that you see a unique show these days but this is unmatched.I had settled in for a black comedy about a stalker and her victim, expecting nothing more that some tongue-in-cheek humour and big acting of almost caricature parts. I was so wrong and I couldn't be happier about it.Every episode delivered layer upon layer, rising turmoil, revelatory horrors and gut wrenching spirals. Gadd is phenomenal and draws upon the truth of this story as its victim, to deliver a stunning performance.Gunning's portrayal of the obsessive stalker gave Gadd everything he needed to work with. I felt I was in Gadd's head every time she was on screen - the sympathy, the anger, the fear.This is a stand-out show of the year so far for me. It's a challenge to watch at its darkest, will make you well up at its saddest and beam with joy at its best.

0	From the very first episode, this series has been setting up great expectations and delivering more than I could imagine. It begins with slowly and naturally introducing us to the ton of characters in the show, all the while keeping us hooked on to amazing story. This has everything one could hope for in a show and more. The brilliant world created here has kings, warriors, slaves, giants, beasts, magic and what not, and yet seems very real. Every action has consequences. I guess this justifies why it took George R.R Martin so many years to write the books these are based on. Everything about the show is wonderful- that is untill they ran out of the story from the books. I haven't read the books this is based on. But I could clearly feel that some thing has changed drastically since season 6. This series suddenly seemed like any other series. For me, the show has been severely degrading since then. There have been some great moments and good episodes. But the over all story seems random. It feels like they are planning these great moments and fights, and then randomly connecting the dots in between. It is very frustrating to see such an awesome show end so badly.	first episode series set great expectation deliver could imagine begin slowly naturally introduce we ton character show keep we hook amaze story everything one could hope show brilliant world create king warrior slave giant beast magic yet seem real every action consequence guess justify take george r r martin many year write book base everything show wonderful untill run story book read book base could clearly feel thing change drastically since season series suddenly seem like series show severely degrade since great moment good episode story seem random feel like plan great moment fight randomly connect dot frustrate see awesome show end badly
2	Started the series out of boredom with lower expectations than you can imagine but am genuinely impressed by the show in all aspects. I've loved the games since a kid but purely for gameplay/aesthetics so above all else I was surprised how great the storytelling of it all is, nuance and depth are actually used in how they present the many factions in universe and not even in some bland centrist way either. My only criticism is the egregious levels of fan service at times but at least it's usually subtle so not too obnoxious. The political themes from the games are even well presented, always felt like some subtly is missed by many fans but it's all in your face here.	start series boredom low expectation imagine genuinely impress show aspect love game since kid purely gameplay aesthetic else surprise great storytelle nuance depth actually use present many faction universe even bland centrist way either criticism egregious level fan service time least usually subtle obnoxious political theme game even well present always feel like subtly miss many fan face

2	First off, I used to have a 10/10 for the show but after watching season 8 ep 3, I can no longer consider it a masterpiece. The writing has been atrocious, no spacing between major moments. Season 8 is definitely going to be the worst season in GOT history, even if the last two eps are Brilliant which I'm starting to feel is highly unlikely. However I'm still giving GOT as a whole 8/10 because of what the show once was, but season 8 has ruined it. Their best hope now is to hire some new writers and redo season eight with 10 episodes, so key moments are spaced out and not feel all jumbled together like they do currently, and give more justice to the night king so that GOT can go out with a bang and be remembered as the greatest show that ever was, like it was supposed to.	first use show watch season ep long consider masterpiece write atrocious space major moment season definitely go bad season get history even last two eps brilliant start feel highly unlikely however still give get whole show season ruin best hope hire new writer redo season eight episode key moment space feel jumble together like currently give justice night king get go bang remember great show ever like suppose
1	That is basically the gist of it. Like in any police series, way too many things happen in one episode and the rookies experience more shootings and heavy crime than most police in many life times.The bad writing is mostly about how the leave of people from the show is dealt with. They might get a short farewell, but then they are gone and nobody thinks about them anymore for more than one episode. That lacks. Also the writers make quite many characters spill deep wisdom out of the blue that usually takes a life-time to acquire and therefore the only one who doesn't look silly doing it, is the Sergeant. Also it is not credible that the receiving end always follows this advise given. Also it is silly how the relationships that end in the show never have a fall-out.	basically gist like police series way many thing happen one episode rookie experience shoot heavy crime police many life time bad write mostly leave people show deal might get short farewell go nobody think anymore one episode lack also writer make quite many character spill deep wisdom blue usually take life time acquire therefore one look silly sergeant also credible receive end always follow advise give also silly relationship end show never fall
1	"Before watching this and even before reviewing i did not know this was based off a book, therefor this review will be based off those experiences.The first 3-4 episodes are good, enticing and suspenseful sci-fi style episodes. I was drawn in and committed to the story. The element of mystery is very strong and compelling making you want to see where this goes.Then it falls of a cliff and flatlines like a vast ocean against a mountain (kinda like a certain scene funny enough). It turns into a day's of our lives drama touchy touchy feel good look at me show and you begin to think to yourself ""This is not what i signed up for, what am i even watching anymore"".There is a scene/event that happens in episode 5 which is just crazy and brings the show briefly back to extremely interesting, but this is just a mere spike before flatlining again, never really picking back up until finally falling off into oblivion.Maybe based on the books it will pick back up in season 2, but i am reviewing season 1 from a blind perspective and frankly will only watch season 2 if i'm desperate."	watch even review know base book therefor review base experience first episode good entice suspenseful sci fi style episode draw commit story element mystery strong compel make want see go fall cliff flatline like vast ocean mountain kinda like certain scene funny enough turn day live drama touchy touchy feel good look show begin think sign even watch anymore scene event happen episode crazy bring show briefly back extremely interest mere spike flatline never really pick back finally fall oblivion maybe base book pick back season review season blind perspective frankly watch season desperate
1	After watching the first season, I can say it was well-done, of high quality and enjoyable enough.Perhaps I was not the target audience, or perhaps everything was too foreshadowed such that I dont recall being surprised by anything. Or perhaps it was the times the show seemed to break its own rules.. I am not sure, but I dont feel as impressed as I should be which is weird.I will still check out season 2, and did enjoy it. The quality is certainly worthy of the 8.7 score it currently has, but ... it just feels like something was missing. Its hard to say, but I really only enjoyed it like a 6 or 7 out of 10..still check it out, people seem to love it.	watch first season say well do high quality enjoyable enough perhaps target audience perhaps everything foreshadow do not recall surprise anything perhaps time show seem break rule sure do not feel impress weird still check season enjoy quality certainly worthy score currently feel like something miss hard say really enjoy like still check people seem love

Without too many spoilers; there are time-jumps in the final episode between whats now the past and the present where we meet an old decrepit Blackthorn in his final days back at his home in England with his grandchildren marvelling at his worn and chipped katana. However theres no further development in the plot to how he gets back or when he does and how this scene is relevant to the events in Japan. Jump back to Japan, many of the major characters are dead and the story concludes with Toranaga preparing for the final battle against Ishido, with many developments left untreated such as Blackthorns canon training or why Toranaga granted plots to the Christian priests and courtesans in close proximity to each other, whether it was unwitting or a deliberatly plotted move.	abrupt end series without many spoiler time jump final episode what s past present meet old decrepit blackthorn final day back home england grandchildren marvel wear chip katana however there s development plot get back scene relevant event japan jump back japan many major character dead story conclude toranaga prepare final battle ishido many development leave untreated blackthorn canon train toranaga grant plot christian priest courtesan close proximity whether unwitte deliberatly plot move

As far as the end and Aegon Jon Snow Targaryen...the rightful air...I couldn't see anything more ridiculous. May as well have the drowned God resurrect Theon.

I think in some parts it started out good, but then it just spiraled out into some kind of soapy-over-dramatic, snooze fest- and that's putting it lightly. There are so many more shows that are more deserving of all the acclaim that Grey's Anatomy gets all the time. I think it's just one of those shows that is ""popular,"" but not really that good. Doctor shows like House are much better, because they don't value the doctors over the patients, which Grey's Anatomy tends to do all the time.

1	"This show is difficult for me to review cause from a technical standpoint it's amazing. The acting, direction, pacing, and writing are all amazing. I was gripped from the beginning. But then it transformed into something I was certainly not expecting in the 4th episode. I've finished the whole show and I feel icky. It's not the sexual violence and rape that has me most unsettled but the depiction of Richard ""Donny"" and his own mental illness. I can't help but feel like this show is a self indulgent public lashing. Everyone is praising him for being so raw and brave tackling sexual violence and grooming. On one hand I appreciate his willingness to be honest with the depiction of himself warts and all. On the other hand, this is a true story depicting his personal true story graphic rapes, sexual promiscuity and deep-seeded sexual confusion/unhealthy behaviors stemming from his abuser, graphic drug abuse, lies, narcissism, soul crushing insecurity, public embarrassment, deeply unhealthy relationships with stalker and others near him, and more. Where he went, disaster followed. I'm not saying that these things don't happen in life. But I'm not sure it's meant to be prettied up on a high rated Netflix show and herald as entertainment. I screamed at the screen multiple times for him to go to a therapist. If this was a fictional story maybe I'd feel differently, but it's not. And at the end of it the conclusion of all his trials there's nothing to glean from it. I'm left feeling empty, sick, and deeply sad for him. I hope he can truly seek help."	show difficult review cause technical standpoint amaze act direction pace write amaze grip begin transform something certainly expect th episode finish whole show feel icky sexual violence rape unsettle depiction richard donny mental illness help feel like show self indulgent public lash everyone praise raw brave tackle sexual violence groom one hand appreciate willingness honest depiction wart hand true story depict personal true story graphic rap sexual promiscuity deep seed sexual confusion unhealthy behavior stem abuser graphic drug abuse lie narcissism soul crush insecurity public embarrassment deeply unhealthy relationship stalker other near go disaster follow say thing happen life sure mean pretty high rat netflix show herald entertainment scream screen multiple time go therapist fictional story maybe feel differently end conclusion trial nothing glean leave feel empty sick deeply sad hope truly seek help
0	Those who worked on the props, the sets, the costumes and those who tried their best to act hard for this deserve applause.The writers however should have been locked in a room with a few copies of Fallout 1-4 and not allowed near a word processor till they understood the setting properly. Or learned how to write satisfying narrative and well made characters.Video game adaptations can be great. Castlevania for example was a case of beautifully constructed writing, characterisation and faithfulness to a fanbase and setting that was rewarded with adoration by the fans, myself included. This was not that.I watched the entire thing. This felt like a show written by people who had a vague idea and exposure to what Fallout is, but who were ultimately awful at writing characters you want to see more of. Goggins Ghoul does his best to save the show.They scattered endless member berries throughout the show to evoke reactions of 'dontcha remember this from the game?!'... 'Oh look, he said 'war never changes'!... dontcha remember that? That power armour was cool wasn't it?!'. It's gratuitous and overbears the entire show, because it's the only way to hide the sheer foul stench from the writing.The power armour was cool.It looks like Fallout. It sounds like fallout. It smells like something Dogmeat left for you.	work prop set costume try good act hard deserve applause writer however lock room copy fallout allow near word processor till understand set properly learn write satisfy narrative well make character video game adaptation great castlevania example case beautifully construct write characterisation faithfulness fanbase set reward adoration fan include watch entire thing feel like show write people vague idea exposure fallout ultimately awful write character want see goggin ghoul good save show scatter endless member berry throughout show evoke reaction dontcha remember game oh look say war never change dontcha remember power armour cool gratuitous overbear entire show way hide sheer foul stench write power armour cool look like fallout sound like fallout smell like something dogmeat leave
2	I never played the game, but when i saw a trailer of this series my attention was caught. For me it's a mix of Star Wars, The Last of Us, Alien and The Walking Dead. Sure the storyline is pretty straight on, with no difficult timelines or whatever (like 'Dark' or '1899'). But boy it's entertaining and somehow it's keeps you hooked. The visuals are great, acting it pretty good and the story never gets slow. Lucy is a likable main character, not to strong and with human naiveties.You can sense it's a game adaption with all the hardcore action and arcade / over the top shootings, but not in a way your'e looking at a B movie or something.	never play game see trailer series attention catch mix star war last we alien walk dead sure storyline pretty straight difficult timeline whatever like dark boy entertain somehow keep hook visual great act pretty good story never get slow lucy likable main character strong human naivety sense game adaption hardcore action arcade top shoot way e look b movie something

Lucy, one of the lead female character, had ZERO marks anywhere on her face, her uniform always stayed in mint condition and even her hair were not only neatly tied up all the time but stayed shiny as if she just had her hair done by a professional. The ONLY little mark shown on her face was that minor cut on her lips that happened during one of the action sequences.I would love to know the secret of staying like that, it must be some sort of magic in future, right?

2	"Believe the hype-Netflix's ""Baby Reindeer"" is an absolute masterpiece that grips you from the very first scene and doesn't let go. Adapted from Richard Gadd's riveting true-life stage play, which first captivated audiences at the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe, the series thrusts viewers into a tense and disturbing narrative. It centers on a man haunted by an obsessive stalker, weaving this thread into a larger tapestry of buried trauma and personal demons. The tension is relentless, keeping you on the edge of your seat as the story unfolds with a chilling precision that's both rare and riveting. It's the kind of show you find yourself watching in one sitting because turning it off simply isn't an option.The series' strength lies not just in its gripping plot but in its deep, raw portrayal of loneliness and the human yearning for connection-themes that echo another Netflix masterpiece, ""Beef."" Both series skillfully dissect the complexities of brokenness and toxic relationships, but ""Baby Reindeer"" distinguishes itself with its raw and flawless execution of human traumas and connections formed in that dark space. Each moment is crafted with an exquisite balance of beauty and darkness, making it a tough, yet utterly compelling watch. This blend of harrowing storytelling and brilliant visual storytelling cements ""Baby Reindeer"" as more than just entertainment; it's a profound experience that sticks with you, long after the screen goes dark."	believe hype netflix baby reindeer absolute masterpiece grip first scene let go adapt richard gadd rivet true life stage play first captivate audience edinburgh fringe series thrust viewer tense disturb narrative center man haunt obsessive stalker weave thread large tapestry bury trauma personal demon tension relentless keep edge seat story unfold chill precision rare rivet kind show find watch one sit turn simply option series strength lie grip plot deep raw portrayal loneliness human yearn connection theme echo another netflix masterpiece beef series skillfully dissect complexity brokenness toxic relationship baby reindeer distinguish raw flawless execution human traumas connection form dark space moment craft exquisite balance beauty darkness make tough yet utterly compel watch blend harrow storytelle brilliant visual storytelle cement baby reindeer entertainment profound experience stick long screen go dark
1	"The first 5 Seasons of Game Of Thrones are exceptional, a beautifully structured series. The sets, characters, pacing, twists - exceptional. I could not fault it, however, after that things went downhill.When it came to Season 5, the author of the books (George R. R. Martin) and HBO had a disagreement. Martin wanted the show to run across more series, to give all his complex story lines the chance to grow & move at a natural pace. HBO declined and so he dropped off the project, which is extremely evident.Season 6 & 7, although flawed, were still watchable. The books & George's earlier comments paved the way for both seasons, but you could feel that the episodes lacked substance.This brings us to the latest season, and after 2 years of waiting expectations were very high. The first two episodes were very plain, the reunions were wonderful, however you could tell they were setting up for one of the biggest fights of the series, which had been greatly anticipated since Season 1. I tried to not to have too high of expectations, however the director referred to episode 3 as ""bigger than Helms Deep"" which is a comment that will always spark excitement.Episode 3 was so utterly disappointing, in every way. If you were somehow able to see through the intense darkness (what was the director thinking?) you will crumble to the poor decisions made by writers. I will not stem into this too much, but basically Dan & Dave chose to go down the Hollywood path, completely disregarding any real story or strategy. Episode 4 was equally as disappointing, which I was hoping would redeem the final season.The writers have ruined this final season by fast tracking characters (basically teleporting), making the smartest of characters docile, and letting plot armor protect 'favorites'. I am still going to watch until the end, but I thought I would warn any future viewer to prepare yourself, as there is nothing more heartbreaking than watching terrible writing ruin a otherwise tremendous series."	first season game throne exceptional beautifully structure series set character pace twist exceptional could fault however thing go downhill come season author book george r r martin hbo disagreement martin want show run across series give complex story line chance grow move natural pace hbo decline drop project extremely evident season although flaw still watchable book george early comment pave way season could feel episode lack substance bring we late season year wait expectation high first two episode plain reunion wonderful however could tell set one big fight series greatly anticipate since season try high expectation however director refer episode big helm deep comment always spark excitement episode utterly disappoint every way somehow able see intense darkness director think crumble poor decision make writer stem much basically dan dave choose go hollywood path completely disregard real story strategy episode equally disappoint hop would redeem final season writer ruin final season fast track character basically teleport make smart character docile let plot armor protect favorite still go watch end think would warn future viewer prepare nothing heartbreaking watch terrible write ruin otherwise tremendous series
0	"If you've read the original book, you'll know how terribly this adaptation has been done, it's a waste of such a great Three-Body Universe.After watching all eight episodes, the biggest overall feeling is that this drama seems to be quite superficial. The production team neither portrays the brutal reality faced by the Three-Body civilization nor adequately presents the impact of the sophons on human science. Even the part about ""the bugs have never been eradicated"" at the end doesn't resonate much. The fundamental reason is that, in eight episodes (which is roughly equivalent to sixteen episodes in typical Chinese dramas), the story stretches all the way from the twinkling of the universe to the Wallfacers and the Staircase Project, which results in a lack of detailed portrayal of the characters' emotions and struggles with inner turmoil. However, this is precisely the essence of The Three-Body Problem."	read original book know terribly adaptation do waste great three body universe watch eight episode big overall feel drama seem quite superficial production team neither portray brutal reality face three body civilization adequately present impact sophon human science even part bug never eradicate end resonate much fundamental reason eight episode roughly equivalent sixteen episode typical chinese drama story stretch way twinkle universe wallfacer staircase project result lack detail portrayal character emotion struggle inner turmoil however precisely essence three body problem
2	This television series appears to be based on the Chinese author Liu Cixin's The Three Body Problem (2008) that later became a Chinese movie in 2023 and likely the English translation by Ken Liu (2014) which won a Hugo Award. The plot switches between the terrifying event during Chinese Cultural revolution and later to the present day with the mysterious death of scientists around the around as well as involving the actual dilemma of predicting the orbital paths of three bodies in space. The Netflix first season is powerful and at times captivating but at the same time concluding with a disappointing inconclusive ending. One of the most original science fiction portrayals in years, 3 Body Problem has some problem with pacing in places, one or two unnecessary subplots, the earlier semi-light tone quickly darkening in later episodes, and a few scenes that really don't much rational sense that perhaps were included more for dramatic effect unlike the more consistently, scientifically, and practically filmed Interstellar (2014). The group ensemble seems less focused and compelling than those found in The Magician (2005) and Threshold (2005) television series and less dynamic than the multi-faceted sci fi television series Fringe (2008). Other outstanding movies with an alien, time themes include The Arrival (2016), the Fountain (2006), and the cult classic Slaughterhouse Five (1972). Nevertheless this series includes some of the most exotic visually titillating set designs and eerie ominous alien features that make the series stand out at times and worth experiencing along with some high emotionally intense dynamics and intimately personal turmoil among characters. Hopefully Season Two will bring better satisfaction that Season One strongly suggests.	television series appear base chinese author liu cixin three body problem later become chinese movie likely english translation ken liu hugo award plot switch terrify event chinese cultural revolution later present day mysterious death scientist around around well involve actual dilemma predict orbital path three body space netflix first season powerful time captivate time conclude disappoint inconclusive end one original science fiction portrayal year body problem problem pace place one two unnecessary subplot early semi light tone quickly darken later episode scene really much rational sense perhaps include dramatic effect unlike consistently scientifically practically film interstellar group ensemble seem less focus compel find magician threshold television series less dynamic multi faceted sci fi television series fringe outstanding movie alien time theme include arrival fountain cult classic slaughterhouse five nevertheless series include exotic visually titillate set design eerie ominous alien feature make series stand time worth experience along high emotionally intense dynamic intimately personal turmoil among character hopefully season two bring well satisfaction season one strongly suggest

After all, the United States is a country with a predominantly white population, and high-risk units such as the police and the military have more men than women. But is the proportion of black people in this police station too high? There are three main actors who are black, one Chinese, one Latino, and three female police officers.

This one is one of the worst out there.You take a game series, make a TV show version of it, declare it to be a ""canon"" continuation of the games and let a bunch of Marvel loving redditors with Liberal arts degree write for it, what is the result?The result is a show that shows zero respect for the original games, contradicting them left and right, laughably bad writing where even the tiniest amount of thinking makes the whole show fall apart, and of course, a show stuffed full with current day propaganda, much like the vast majority of everything that comes out nowadays, with incompetent ehite males, goofy weak black males, Mary sue protagonist, pregnant woman mowing down raiders while laughing manically, WOW!

0	Sadly overacted, unrealistic, predictable series with 10 carbon copies of one character. The surgeons & residents all stammer, grow speechless, have the same tone, similar reactions, lines, mannerisms, tears streaming down their faces... and these are doctors in a hospital. Have the show's creators and writers ever been in a hospital? It's all unheard of.I worked in a hospital with surgeons for 7 years and never ever saw one of them cry or scream of grow out of control the way these characters do every day on the job. It's totally ludicrous - doctors are very cool-headed in their work, to the point of almost lacking compassion at all - especially surgeons. They are criticized for being totally heartless, but you have to be to cut into human flesh. THey are never melodramatic the way ALL of the characters on this show are... not to mention the rotating bed partners and switching up sexuality -- although most surgeons are sleaze-bags, the philandering is usually with nurses, not with other doctors and never same-sex. Grays features all kinds of unrealistic craziness. Please give the American public a break and stop producing and airing this silly junk.	sadly overact unrealistic predictable series carbon copy one character surgeon resident stammer grow speechless tone similar reaction line mannerism tear stream face doctor hospital show creator writer ever hospital unheard work hospital surgeon year never ever see one cry scream grow control way character every day job totally ludicrous doctor cool head work point almost lack compassion especially surgeon criticize totally heartless cut human flesh never melodramatic way character show mention rotate bed partner switch sexuality although surgeon sleaze bag philander usually nurse doctor never sex gray feature kind unrealistic craziness please give american public break stop produce air silly junk
0	"No spoilers.I read the books when they first came out and watched the show from the start. The first three seasons based off the books are a masterpiece. Sadly because the books weren't finished the show takes a radical direction from then on with a lot less character development and more action and CGI. Seasons 4 and 5 still had many pointers from the author George RR Martin, so they are okay but not as good as the first three. At seasons 6 and 7 plot holes start to appear and characters teleport around the world wherever the script needs them, doing uncharacteristic things or having their story arc end with a fizzle. Character development has completely ended and the show priority is action and CGI above everything.Season 8 the final season could be from a completely different show. The developed characters change in intelligence and personality. The script changes established sub plots and character arcs because as the script writers stated on record, ""They wanted to shock the audience and do something completely different.""Well recording over the end of a film with a comedy sketch like this is a VHS video tape is shocking and completely unexpected, but not for good reasons!The final season is so alien to the whole world design and established story arc that it really doesn't fit in with anything in previous seasons. It's shallow, rushed, badly written and destroys almost a decade of good television just for shock value. It ruins any replay value in the whole series that there just isn't any point in watching it again. There are many subplots that lead to dead ends, unanswered questions, character changes that don't match the characters natural progression in the past 7 seasons and then there are the sloppy edits and continuity errors like plastic water bottles on set or a Starbucks coffee cup at a medieval feast in plain sight. Battles that make no sense, tactics that don't work, plot armour and fan fiction, armies that die to a last in a desperate stand of a few dozen, only to respawn like new in the very next episode. Weapons that magically work or don't work depending on the new plot the useless script writers come up with next. Wounds that a fatal suddenly becoming a but a scratch and characters gaining superpowers like flight, invisibility and invulnerability. A fantasy show that was great because it prided itself on not doing fantasy tropes suddenly does every fantasy trope in the book. Everything about this final season is rushed and sloppy and a mess. You would be better off pretending season 8 didn't exist. It will ruin everything you have watched up to that point. I can't even begin to cover all the problems with each episode. There are plenty of YouTube channels that go into detail with all the discrepancies and problems of each episode. Seasons 6 and 7 aren't great but are still watchable. But season 8 is not even watchable. Do yourself a favour and don't watch it. You will find only disappointment and frustration.If the show ended at season 3 it would be a 10/10. If it ended at season 5 it would be an 8/10, at season 7 it would be a 6.9/10 but with season 8 it's about a 3/10 and those three points are for the acting and set design.

And the games are also violent. But SERIOUSLY. People who find this level of absurd gore and ultraviolence entertaining are disturbed individuals. The makers of this show just want it to be ""The Boys"", but why can't it just be Fallout? You've already got an extremely popular, highly beloved franchise with an incredibly rich world to play in. This show could be incredible. It takes some special people to turn such a sure thing into garbage."	massive fan game put hundred hundred hour familiar quirky world sometimes dark character situation game also violent seriously people find level absurd gore ultraviolence entertain disturb individual maker show want boy fallout already get extremely popular highly beloved franchise incredibly rich world play show could incredible take special people turn sure thing garbage
0	"Amazon Prime's ""Fallout"" series emerges as a vivid tableau of the beloved video game's universe, repackaged with a distinctively modern twist that seems tailored specifically for a Gen Z audience. Helmed by Lisa Joy of ""Westworld"" fame and Geneva Robertson-Dworet, known for her ventures into action-packed science fiction, the series injects a youthful vibrancy into the bleakness of post-apocalyptic survival. However, this injection skews the narrative, favoring contemporary issues and stylistic flourishes that resonate more with new viewers rather than purists of the ""Fallout"" franchise.The result is a series that feels fundamentally disjointed; it's slick and stylized, with an aesthetic and thematic overhaul meant to appeal to younger viewers who appreciate rapid-paced storytelling and visually driven narratives. This focus on style over substance and an evident preference for melodramatic over meaningful character development suggests a misalignment with the original spirit of ""Fallout."" Such a directional shift might capture the fleeting attention of Gen Z viewers, yet it leaves longtime fans of the series alienated, underscoring a generational divide in both the interpretation and appreciation of what makes ""Fallout"" fundamentally compelling. This version of ""Fallout,"" while visually arresting, suggests that sometimes a shared name might be the only thing a adaptation retains from its source material, turning a potentially rich narrative landscape into mere thematic ruins."	amazon prime fallout series emerge vivid tableau belove video game universe repackage distinctively modern twist seem tailor specifically gen z audience helm lisa joy westworld fame geneva robertson dworet know venture action pack science fiction series inject youthful vibrancy bleakness post apocalyptic survival however injection skew narrative favor contemporary issue stylistic flourish resonate new viewer rather purist fallout franchise result series feel fundamentally disjoint slick stylize aesthetic thematic overhaul mean appeal young viewer appreciate rapid pace storytelle visually drive narrative focus style substance evident preference melodramatic meaningful character development suggest misalignment original spirit fallout directional shift might capture fleet attention gen z viewer yet leave longtime fan series alienate underscore generational divide interpretation appreciation make fallout fundamentally compel version fallout visually arrest suggest sometimes share name might thing adaptation retain source material turn potentially rich narrative landscape mere thematic ruin
0	The show would probably have a chance if it has taken itself less seriously. You cannot have it both ways, tackling a a subject like this that can be prolonged for many years and seasons, rushing it through the important parts and spending whole episodes on unremarkable cry baby scenes. The main characters are completely insufferable, acting like spoiled teenagers although they are supposedly top notch scientists. It is very difficult to not get frustatrated with them having these behavioural ups and downs while the rest of the cast/world has to put up with them because ... no reason. And that's the biggest problem of the show. Mary Sues and more Mary Sues because nowadays writng an actual hero is so difficult that checking boxes has become the go to pattern.	show would probably chance take less seriously way tackle subject like prolong many year season rush important part spend whole episode unremarkable cry baby scene main character completely insufferable act like spoil teenager although supposedly top notch scientist difficult get frustatrate behavioural up down rest cast world put reason big problem show mary sue mary sue nowadays writng actual hero difficult check box become go pattern

1	"A mild, mostly realistic but artificial representation of that post-apocalyptic city with heavily interlaced 1950s and 22nd-23rd century vibes, devices, equipment and way of life.It feels incomplete, could have been provided with heavier development as to Cooper Howard's radioactive fate, Lucy's father played mysteriously by Kyle MacLachlan and her mother as well.These incomplete stands and ""plot holes"" hurt the series and are taintedly replaced with the Ghoul's charismatic psycho prowesses and pistol whipping. Also, the character of Michael Emerson was hugely wasted, equaling to the weight of his head mostly. Bad decision in my opinion, to say the least.All that I said and unhappily ""complained"" about had just one purpose. The milking of viewers for a second season and making them go berserkly mad at the long wait till 'Fallout II'.In retrospect, please allow me to praise the mostly speedy development and production of this ""future-cult"" show that has the potential to become equal to or even surpass 'Westworld' quality, if they add some more fusion reactions, more engaging character development and blindingly bright orange-white multi-megaton atomic explosions in the series' future.P.

0	I was really looking forward to this new version of Clavell's book as I had enjoyed the Richard Chamberlain version all those years ago.The first 3 episodes I could see that the story was developing, albeit at a slow almost glacial pace, and was looking forward to something happening.However that pace I mentioned earlier slowed, if such a thing were possible, and I found myself getting bored, to the point where I was beginning to envy those cast members who managed to get out early by committing seppuku. I presume had that written in their contracts after reading the script.Nothing happened, literally nothing, we saw the same conversations, and whilst some high minded critics might refer to that being 'nuanced' anyone else looking to be entertained would call it repetitive.Suffice to say the series was a disappointment and how any reviewer on here can give it 10/10 is beyond me, when you compare it to the likes of the Sopranos or Breaking Bad.Simply mind boggling, or perhaps like me they started to doze off.Sayonara.	really look forward new version clavell book enjoy richard chamberlain version year ago first episode could see story develop albeit slow almost glacial pace look forward something happen however pace mention early slow thing possible find get bore point begin envy cast member manage get early commit seppuku presume write contract read script nothing happen literally nothing see conversation whilst high mind critic might refer nuance anyone else look entertain would call repetitive suffice say series disappointment reviewer give beyond compare like soprano break bad simply mind boggle perhaps like start doze sayonara

2	I wasn't going to write anything about this series simply because I got so heart broken by the terrible ending that never touched my wildest dreams but in a negative way!! If you tell me a year back I would rate this series anything less than an 10 i would've considered you crazy beyond repair but now things has changed and an 8 is a compliment in comparison to the total let down that I recieved from season 8!! Thing is I would've been OK with finishing off the white walkers in one dark episode and if the last two episodes concluded in a decent rational manner i would've accepted the season despite its multiple flaws but to end it the way they did in the last two episodes is pure murder to us viewers and to the name GOT has created for itself through sheer brilliant story telling and execution at the highest level.. There is no need to go on further because after reading a few comments I was aware that it's an almost universal feeling that season 8 was such an ugly shocking let down that one has to live with... Wish they could work on an alternative ending like some movies do and give us all the ending that we crave for with a good pinch of humility and optimism maybe that could heal things a little	go write anything series simply get heart break terrible end never touch wild dream negative way tell year back would rate series anything less would consider crazy beyond repair thing change compliment comparison total let recieved season thing would ok finish white walker one dark episode last two episode conclude decent rational manner would accept season despite multiple flaw end way last two episode pure murder us viewer name get create sheer brilliant story tell execution high level need go read comment aware almost universal feel season ugly shock let one live wish could work alternative end like movie give we end crave good pinch humility optimism maybe could heal thing little

0	Why? I was looking forward to this series, but immediately the show lazily falls to new Hollywood diversity tropes. Smart attractive young diverse female lead looking like a super model doesn't convey intellectual to me. Then the identity of villain is set up from episode one, no surprise another Hollywood trope.Then in the first episode the lead smashes the black guy in the chest. Imagine the shrill hysteria if that was gender reverse.I'll continue to watch and may change my review. I expected so much more from these got legendary show runners but do far is pulp. Maybe JRR held them back from their worst impulses.	look forward series immediately show lazily fall new hollywood diversity trope smart attractive young diverse female lead look like super model convey intellectual identity villain set episode one surprise another hollywood trope first episode lead smash black guy chest imagine shrill hysteria gender reverse continue watch may change review expect much get legendary show runner far pulp maybe jrr hold back bad impulse

1	"Fabulous, artistic photography. Great 'Film noir' photography. But then apparently there was no budget left for scenario, dialogues and professional or more charismatic actors as in former movies based on Patricia Highsmith's great novel such as 'Plein Soleil' (by René Clément with Maurice Ronet, Alain Delon and Marie Laforêt) or ""Mr Ripley"" (by Anthony Minghella with Matt Damon, Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow).This remake of former movies is fully respecting the original story but stretching it out too much.

1	Almost finished, and I am annoyed with all the reviews so far.I hate the 10/10's that blindly praise it, and the 1/10's that say it's nothing like the game. I am going to assume that they are only loosely familiar with the franchise, because it seems pretty close to the world that I was expecting. It feels pretty close to fallout in my mind.I also don't love it.The closest negative review was a comment about the graphics. The graphics are rough in spots, but that isn't the problem.The problem is pacing.Very quickly we are introduced with a McGuffin. It's very well handled and the first couple of episodes present it in a very solid way. Then it disappears, say around episode 4.Around episode 4, we are introduced to some much needed background about the world. I like this part as well.So I liked 1-4 and 4-8. Why is there a problem?They are different stories. Season 1 is the first four. Great! Season 2 is the second four? Also great. But make clear arcs.This 100% feels like they were trying to emulate a game here.1-4 is the introduction part of the game. We are, like all games, stuck on the railroad of storytelling that introduces the McGufffin. Then something happens and the world opens up.Some players just grind after the McGuffin and keep it going. Some players wander and explore creepy buildings. I personally explore creepy buildings. It's what I enjoy. It's why I enjoyed the second act. But now I am unsatisfied. I reached the end of six and realized that they were going to be only able to finish one of the two story arcs in the time remaining...Oh...yay... another cliffhanger. I guess I saw it coming at least. Don't get me wrong, I understand the need and they just didn't stick the landing. That 3-6 episode segment is rough.I have no problem with a genuinely episodic show. I have no problem with a major story driven show. But you have to be a masterclass genius to get your cake and eat it.	almost finish annoy review far hate blindly praise say nothing like game go assume loosely familiar franchise seem pretty close world expect feel pretty close fallout mind also love close negative review comment graphic graphic rough spot problem problem pace quickly introduce mcguffin well handle first couple episode present solid way disappear say around episode around episode introduce much need background world like part well like problem different story season first four great season second four also great make clear arc feel like try emulate game introduction part game like game stick railroad storytelle introduce mcgufffin something happen world open player grind mcguffin keep go player wander explore creepy build personally explore creepy build enjoy enjoy second act unsatisfied reach end six realize go able finish one two story arc time remain oh yay another cliffhanger guess see come least get wrong understand need stick land episode segment rough problem genuinely episodic show problem major story drive show masterclass genius get cake eat
1	"I generally find ""The Rookie"" enjoyable. Each episode offers well-written interwoven plots that keep me engaged. While using body cameras and vehicle cameras can result in lower video quality, it provides a unique perspective on the action, adding a touch of realism.However, the show has its weaknesses. Jenna Dewan needs to go. I often fast-forward through any scene that she is in.The music is terrible.While Nolan started strong, he seems to have lost some of his appeal, becoming one of the less compelling characters. His actions and facial expressions have become predictable and disappointing.Thankfully, the show boasts several strong personalities who pick up the slack. Lucy and Diaz are standouts, consistently delivering captivating performances. Grey and Bradford are also compelling characters, trailing closely behind in terms of their presence and development. And for those who appreciate eye candy, Dylan Conrique plays a character with undeniable charm.Overall, ""The Rookie"" is a mixed bag. While the concept and some characters remain engaging, certain aspects, like the casting error and lacklustre main character, might leave some viewers wanting more. Still, the series offers solid entertainment for those seeking a cop drama with action, humour, and character-driven stories.Last note: I would have stopped watching long ago if it weren't for Melissa O'Neil (Lucy)."	generally find rookie enjoyable episode offer well write interweave plot keep engage use body camera vehicle camera result low video quality provide unique perspective action add touch realism however show weakness jenna dewan need go often fast forward scene music terrible nolan start strong seem lose appeal become one less compel character action facial expression become predictable disappoint thankfully show boast several strong personality pick slack lucy diaz standout consistently deliver captivate performance grey bradford also compel character trail closely behind term presence development appreciate eye candy dylan conrique play character undeniable charm overall rookie mix bag concept character remain engage certain aspect like cast error lacklustre main character might leave viewer want still series offer solid entertainment seek cop drama action humour character drive story last note would stop watch long ago melissa neil lucy

2	The show is good and keeps it's story through all the seasons. I liked all seasons in there own way, but i have to say sometimes the show has real dumb episodes or the characters just do something that is soo like a normal person would never do that, at least in my opinion. These episodes are fine and sometimes make me laugh just for the dumbness (not saying that everything they do is dumb they are normally really smart in this show) of the characters or the thing they're doing but overall a good show with drama and I enjoyed almost every minute of this series. (Very good acting btw so thumbs up for the actors)	show good keep story season like season way say sometimes show real dumb episode character something soo like normal person would never least opinion episode fine sometimes make laugh dumbness say everything dumb normally really smart show character thing overall good show drama enjoy almost every minute series good act btw thumb actor
0	Ignore the game fans! There will be a lot of 10 star reviews from the game fans saying this is all right and the script and scenes are right, that the music and acgion are righr. Ignore them all, thos is a boring show where the action has no continuity, characters do kot develop, actors cannot act. Bad idea was the one to make this adaptation and it has the same effect as the game, they somehow can hype you up to watch/play it just for you to find out later this is boring and storyline is meaningless. It could be awesome but unfortunately it is not the case. If you need something to make noise in the background so you can fall asleep then its good.	ignore game fan lot star review game fan say right script scene right music acgion righr ignore thos bore show action continuity character kot develop actor act bad idea one make adaptation effect game somehow hype watch play find later bore storyline meaningless could awesome unfortunately case need something make noise background fall asleep good

1	I went into this completely blind--never read the books or saw the Chinese version, and only knew it was a sci-fi show by the guys from GoT. So I had no expectations. I thought it was good, but something was missing that kept it from being great.The production was good, but not inspiring. The acting was good, but I never really felt emotionally connected to the characters, although I came close with Jin. It would have been nice to have more background and world building to become more vested in the story and characters.The plot itself was fine enough, but events seemed to unfold quite quickly without ever showing any effort. A lot happened, but it lacked depth. I thought it was good enough to watch another season, but it didn't really knock my socks off at any point. Good enough, I suppose.	go completely blind never read book see chinese version know sci fi show guy get expectation think good something miss keep great production good inspire act good never really feel emotionally connect character although come close jin would nice background world build become vest story character plot fine enough event seem unfold quite quickly without ever show effort lot happen lack depth think good enough watch another season really knock sock point good enough suppose
1	"I know we are so small and cant comprehend time and we always say greatest of all time to everything , it could have been one to go down in cinematography history as one of the greatest. It had all the backstory , talent , funding and passionate people that worked there. Like Ned Stark said everything before the word BUT is horse ""beep"" , this one has a big but (no pun intended ) .I kept my rating at 10 stars till season 6 ,even tho season 5 had major issues and there were some nonsensical moments here and there but it truly deserved the 10 star rating anyway till that point . It was pretty obvious by this point GRRM left the train. Conspiracy theories aside ( one was pretty crazy but plausible that Disney had a hand in rushing D&D to wrap up GoT so they can start their new Star wars saga , crazy right ) it felt like everything was getting ridiculously rushed to a point where teleportation was something that might be possible . Funny meme about teleportation there is a mobile game for GoT and guess what you have teleportation scrolls , you can literally teleport your House Keep around the map .Season 6 has some great moments but then slowly but surely the writing goes down hill faster then a Dothraki screamer . Shock value , hollywood cliches and out of character decisions takes hold and grips by the neck everything we used to love about this show tighter then an Dorne viper .Season 7 tells us clearly that everything is out of control now and there is hardly a way back to what it once made everything epic , but for all the fans out there there is still quite a lot of hope , at least i had it going into season 8.Season 8 is exactly that soul crushing, utter disappointment and disgust towards all the major writing decisions and scripts .I am not ungrateful , without D&D and HBO to start it all this story at least for the time being would have been just an amazing story in a book saga (which for a lot of people is enough) therefor I am truly thankful they started all of this BUT for what they have done in the last 2 seasons (at least) i will use the last words of Stannis Baratheon : ""Go on do your Duty"" ..... and be Done with it ...(off screen) ."	know small can not comprehend time always say great time everything could one go cinematography history one great backstory talent fund passionate people work like ned stark say everything word horse beep one big pun intend keep rat star till season even tho season major issue nonsensical moment truly deserve star rat anyway till point pretty obvious point grrm leave train conspiracy theory aside one pretty crazy plausible disney hand rush wrap get start new star war saga crazy right feel like everything get ridiculously rush point teleportation something might possible funny meme teleportation mobile game get guess teleportation scroll literally teleport house keep around map season great moment slowly surely write go hill fast dothraki screamer shock value hollywood cliche character decision take hold grip neck everything use love show tight dorne viper season tell we clearly everything control hardly way back make everything epic fan still quite lot hope least go season season exactly soul crush utter disappointment disgust towards major write decision script ungrateful without hbo start story least time would amaze story book saga lot people enough therefor truly thankful start do last season least use last word stannis baratheon go duty do screen
1	An obvious product of handing it to multiple writers and directors and making it up as they went. Drastic tonal inconsistency between episodes and plots that take nonsense turns just to somehow justify how some character knows which way to go. The whole thing was improved for me significantly by skipping over all the Brotherhood of Steel stuff though because in the games I always found them obnoxious and sanctimonious and that's sure on point here. And Maximus is NOT a good person. I don't care how much they try to say it in the plot. Enjoy him NEVER not seeming like a whiny little boy. EVER. I honestly hate that characters guts.	obvious product hand multiple writer director make go drastic tonal inconsistency episode plot take nonsense turn somehow justify character know way go whole thing improve significantly skip brotherhood steel stuff though game always find obnoxious sanctimonious sure point maximus good person care much try say plot enjoy never seem like whiny little boy ever honestly hate character gut
2	So everyone knows that season 8 blows. It's common knowledge. For the people who haven't yet seen it, is it worth it to watch anyways?Well, yes and no. I would definitely say for most you can still enjoy the majority of the show. However, if you are the type of person that values the destination MORE than the journey, I would be cautious.Seasons 1-4: 10/10Seasons 5-6: 9/10Season 7: 7/10Season 8: 3/10Seasons 1-6 have some of my favorite moments in storytelling, ever. If you are a fan of intense, gritty realism, intriguing plot, and complex characters, I would definitely still recommend this show, just know what you're getting yourself into.MY WARNING TO THOSE STARTING: DO NOT get too emotionally attached to the show. Enjoy it for its quality alone, and understand WHY the last 2 seasons are not as good. This way you will not be depressed for weeks on end after watching the last season like I was.Let this show be the prime example of how a show goes from some of the most compelling narratives I've ever seen, to absolute trash at the end. From a purely analytical standpoint it is quite fascinating to watch.	everyone know season blow common knowledge people yet see worth watch anyways well yes would definitely say still enjoy majority show however type person value destination journey would cautious season season season season season favorite moment storytelle ever fan intense gritty realism intrigue plot complex character would definitely still recommend show know get warn start get emotionally attach show enjoy quality alone understand last season good way depress week end watch last season like let show prime example show go compel narrative ever see absolute trash end purely analytical standpoint quite fascinate watch
0	Frustration is felt when watching a series like Shogun, when the expectation of finding a passionate narrative is quickly replaced by the discomfort caused by the disrespect for the Portuguese language.The great initial enthusiasm that arose when watching the first minutes of the first episode of the Shogun series quickly disappeared when I realized that the characters, supposedly Portuguese, were not speaking Portuguese. Instead, a version of the Portuguese language adapted into English was presented, with the characters communicating in English as if they were speaking Camões' language. This serious linguistic flaw was a huge disappointment and ended up completely compromising my involvement in the narrative.	frustration feel watch series like shogun expectation find passionate narrative quickly replace discomfort cause disrespect portuguese language great initial enthusiasm arise watch first minute first episode shogun series quickly disappear realize character supposedly portuguese speak portuguese instead version portuguese language adapt english present character communicate english speak cam es language serious linguistic flaw huge disappointment end completely compromise involvement narrative

0	The actor Andrew Scott is almost 50 years old and therefore much too old to play 25 year-old Tom Ripley. He looks more like the father of either Marge or Dickie. Who did the terrible casting?Scott also lacks the irresistible charm of Tom Ripley as described in the books. What young people befriend an old man with no charisma nor good looks?Black and white does not make a film or series good.

2	"Generally, it's a very well done show. Hard to see such thing these days. Quite entertaining. It basically mixes all the genres you can think of: fantasy, soap opera, crime, mystery, thriller, you name it. Writing is very good, although there are (here and there) plot holes and illogical moments. The big budget shows, but never stands in the way of story telling. Music selection is great (reminds me of Bioshock games 1 nad 2, which came 10 years later). Directions and editing are done routinely, but consistently well. Well done casting and acting, though. I tried to play this game once but gave up after a few hours (I believe it was 4, but forgot: the game was not my cup of tea - too open world, too many dialogues, too many quests and so on: everything ""too many"" for my taste, including bugs in the game). This shows borrows the scenery/visuals and overall atmosphere, but brings a partly original story, leaving a lot of space for many more episodes/seasons, which I'm looking forward to. Very entertaining and immersive. Much better than the game. Obviously, such story is better suited for the tv-show, not the game, but that's a personal opinion. Highly recommended, regardless of games' origin."	generally well do show hard see thing day quite entertain basically mix genre think fantasy soap opera crime mystery thriller name write good although plot hole illogical moment big budget show never stand way story tell music selection great remind bioshock game nad come year later direction edit do routinely consistently well well do cast act though try play game give hour believe forget game cup tea open world many dialogue many quest everything many taste include bug game show borrow scenery visual overall atmosphere bring partly original story leave lot space many episode season look forward entertain immersive much well game obviously story well suit tv show game personal opinion highly recommend regardless game origin

0	"I saw the 1st season. Very very boring. I think I have wasted 10 hours of my life, for nothing, by watching this series. The first episode was a bit promising, but later on nothing. So i saw the rest of the 1st season hoping for some improvement, which never ""came"". The script and the plot is nothing special and very very slow. Casting is also poor except, Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage. The production gave me the impression of a low budget film. Too much blood, without any war scenes. Too many sex scenes probably too boost up the ratings. Compared to the Pilars of the Earth (8 mini TV series), The game of Thrones is at least 3 ""steps"" lower. I really do not understand the IMDb high score of 9.4, No way ! There is no point for me to wait for season 2."	see st season bore think waste hour life nothing watch series first episode bite promise later nothing see rest st season hop improvement never come script plot nothing special slow cast also poor except sean bean peter dinklage production give impression low budget film much blood without war scene many sex scene probably boost rat compare pilar earth mini tv series game throne least step lower really understand imdb high score way point wait season

2	"Despite what that delusional negative reviewer said, I think this show had a great, well written start. Great noir nods with fantastic acting to boot. Farrell turn in his usual stellar performance. The relationship between Sugar is wonderfully interesting, nuanced, and complicated, I guess some people need everything spelled out for them in the first fifteen minutes in order to ""get into it."" The pace isn't lightening quick but I wouldn't call it slow. The plot/set up is hardly groundbreaking, it's a typical neo noir plot, but if you're a fan of that stuff you should enjoy it. Also if you're familiar with old movies in general you should enjoy the many references. Most ""professional"" critics also enjoy it, despite what some people who clearly only read reviews they agree with might claim. I only watched the first two and I'm very excited to see where it goes. It could go bad, I've watched many show that start strong and become a mess but I'm very hopeful. The writer is a pretty solid out of the box thinker (he also wrote The Cell) so that's a good sign."	despite delusional negative reviewer say think show great well write start great noir nod fantastic act boot farrell turn usual stellar performance relationship sugar wonderfully interest nuance complicate guess people need everything spell first fifteen minute order get pace lighten quick call slow plot set hardly groundbreake typical neo noir plot fan stuff enjoy also familiar old movie general enjoy many reference professional critic also enjoy despite people clearly read review agree might claim watch first two excite see go could go bad watch many show start strong become mess hopeful writer pretty solid box thinker also write cell good sign

I turned off the season four finale just past the halfway mark because the rest of the episode was both obvious and ludicrous.If it comes bask next season, I won't be watching.

1	"I was so excited for this one. Cause I really liked Arcane and Cyberpunk, the Witcher even The Last of Us was decent enough that I did not feel a slog watching through it. Warcraft was not a 10 for me I still liked it.But out of all of these, Fallout has one of the most interesting world in Video games, say what you want about the quality of their later games, but they know how to build the worlds.Fallout TV show starts out great, they go over the skills and you start feeling good about it, but then it all falls a part. I personally think the premise of 3 vaults is not a bad one, but the execution was. There are so many plot holes and the people are made out to be just stupid, that is the biggest crime of all. Everything is so goofy. The outside world looks good but not great, you do get the fallout feeling but is so empty. A girl who comes from a vault and is bright and stupid at the same way, get trough it all like there is no danger at all, always someone there to save her. What was she gonna do, dive after the gulper if Cooper did not kidnap her. There are so many moments like that, plot armor is think on this one.I liked episode 4 and 8 they were the most action packed. But the overall writing is just bad, it just makes no sense. That makes this show for someone who sees things logically a really hard watch, and not logically as everything has to be like in real life, but in the Fallout world logic. In games the protagonist is weak at the beginning but finds things along the way to aid him/her. I was hoping so much she finds something, a melee weapon maybe, nope.Lets talk about vaults, so the vault 33 and 32 are supposed to be puppets for vault 31 management who sends overseers for those two vaults. Jet somehow the vault of 32 dies out 2 years before we see the show and no one knew? Really? And we are supposed to believe that a tiny brain bot that cant even navigate, is somehow the mastermind who controls all of it? Mind you all are wearing pitboys when the supposed raiders from Vault 32 are coming to visit. And none of them detect radiation?Lets talk about the supposed ""Raiders"" you telling me that a woman who wants to heal the world goes into a vault and murders innocent people? Mind you they have a colony of their own where they actually could clean up but they go to the visit all dirty? What about the plot, we see Lucy taking the ""Husband"" to her room where she finds out that he is not from the vaults but outside cause of the radiation warning the pitboy gives. And the vault 32 died out 2 years ago, and what are we supposed to believe that those 2 years someone sat in the overseers computer and set up the marriage some how, plausible but its such a stretch. How did the ""raiders"" suddenly appear in armor and weapons, was no one watching out for the vault, there were no guards? In every fallout world that has people living in the vaults they have guards.I mean I could write double what I have already said about the plot holes and inconsistencies trough out the show, but I think you get the point. I actually think it would have been better not having played the games at all before this, that way I would not have had many questions that might have ruined it for me.The first season ended in a high note for me though, here's to hoping second season mends the mistakes of the first one.Among my friends most people do not like the shows(Travelers, Stranger things, Band of Brothers, Narcos, Arcane, The Umbrella Academy, Blood of Zeus and Game of thrones etc.) that I like and most like the shows that I do not, so maybe this review speaks of just some of the people who are gonna watch it, but for those who have played the games I think this is not the best."	excite one cause really like arcane cyberpunk witcher even last we decent enough feel slog watch warcraft still like fallout one interest world video game say want quality later game know build world fallout tv show start great go skill start feel good fall part personally think premise vault bad one execution many plot hole people make stupid big crime everything goofy outside world look good great get fallout feel empty girl come vault bright stupid way get trough like danger always someone save go to dive gulper cooper kidnap many moment like plot armor think one like episode action pack overall write bad make sense make show someone see thing logically really hard watch logically everything like real life fallout world logic game protagonist weak begin find thing along way aid hop much find something melee weapon maybe nope let talk vault vault suppose puppet vault management send overseer two vault jet somehow vault die year see show one know really suppose believe tiny brain bot can not even navigate somehow mastermind control mind wear pitboy suppose raider vault come visit none detect radiation let talk suppose raider tell woman want heal world go vault murder innocent people mind colony actually could clean go visit dirty plot see lucy take husband room find vault outside cause radiation warn pitboy give vault die year ago suppose believe year someone sit overseer computer set marriage plausible stretch raider suddenly appear armor weapon one watch vault guard every fallout world people live vault guard mean could write double already say plot hole inconsistency trough show think get point actually think would well play game way would many question might ruin first season end high note though hop second season mend mistake first one among friend people like show traveler stranger thing band brothers narcos arcane umbrella academy blood zeus game throne etc like like show maybe review speak people go to watch play game think well
0	In my opinion, the events of this film are full of errors.I think everyone helps the criminal how to finish his mission of killing the victims, In particular the police,the investigators they committed many mistakes that even children do not commit when investigating accused and criminals.The Main actor Tom Ripley treated the police like puppets.I think it would have been better if they had finished the movie in two hours. Sometimes I felt deathly bored, Some of the shots were very slow.The actors played their roles brilliantly, only there was a problem with the direction and script.It is best that you read the novel before watching these episodes.	opinion event film full error think everyone help criminal finish mission kill victim particular police investigator commit many mistake even child commit investigate accuse criminal main actor tom ripley treat police like puppet think would well finish movie two hour sometimes feel deathly bore shot slow actor play role brilliantly problem direction script good read novel watch episode
1	"Being a huge Fallout fan, and having played all games since Fallout 2, I was a bit skeptical. But when I started watching the series, the attention to detail quickly captivated my curiosity. ""Maybe they really paid tribute to the games?"".And yes, they did in my opinion. However, there seems to be a main focus point on sex and breeding, which in itself is fine, but was never mainly important in the games. Also, the fact that the first season is focused on bringing a head somewhere, doesn't give me a 'Fallout' vibe. It was never a main quest in any of the games or side quests that I played, and combined with the first point I made about sex playing a major role it doesn't feel like a true Fallout adaptation.Like I said, the attention to detail is amazing. As well as the fact that most Vaults were mainly used for experimentation. I also love the characters/actors, but somehow I'm still not sold. Even for Fallout, I think the first season is too much over the top and it needs some adjusting.Also, fusion cores don't last forever, which they make it seem like in the series. And 'civil' ghouls never needed a medicine in the games, they either became feral or stayed civil after the Great War."	huge fallout fan play game since fallout bite skeptical start watch series attention detail quickly captivate curiosity maybe really pay tribute game yes opinion however seem main focus point sex breed fine never mainly important game also fact first season focus bring head somewhere give fallout vibe never main qu game side quest play combine first point make sex play major role feel like true fallout adaptation like say attention detail amaze well fact vault mainly use experimentation also love character actor somehow still sell even fallout think first season much top need adjust also fusion core last forever make seem like series civil ghoul never need medicine game either become feral stay civil great war
1	Alright, the film is entertaining, packed with logical fallacies. They argue that Little Red Riding Hood and the wolf don't comprehend lying, while in the previous scene, they accuse the two scientists of lying, who are then dissected. If they grasp quantum elementary particles to such an extent, they could easily resolve the three-body problem, for if there's a stable period, they could transform the two stars into white dwarfs or other celestial bodies. Gravitational anomalies would cease to exist, and stars wouldn't utilize each other as slingshots. Admittedly, the functioning of the solar system likely required the other two stars, but with such knowledge, they would surely have resolved this issue as well. How certain are they that our planet suits them? They assert it's entirely different. Naturally, they could lay claim to any planet in our planetary system; they could relocate to Mars and undoubtedly possess the capability to terraform. It's a somewhat impulsive decision.	alright film entertain pack logical fallacy argue little red rid hood wolf comprehend lie previous scene accuse two scientist lie dissect grasp quantum elementary particle extent could easily resolve three body problem stable period could transform two star white dwarf celestial body gravitational anomaly would cease exist star utilize slingshot admittedly function solar system likely require two star knowledge would surely resolve issue well certain planet suit assert entirely different naturally could lay claim planet planetary system could relocate mar undoubtedly possess capability terraform somewhat impulsive decision
0	"Being a sci-fi enthusiast, and having heard of the books long prior to the Netflix series, I was quite hopeful for a great sci-fi, but this is just BAD. The concept itself is quite braindead, along with all the smaller concepts within that make up the whole, and aside from that you have a bunch of contrived and nonsensical drama mechanisms, such as the terminally ill dude who is in love with the lead physicist. All the characters destined to supposedly be key players in an interstellar war to save the human race happen to be good drinking buddies, like it was originally a storyboard for an episode of Scooby-Doo or something. The only saving grace for this series for me was Eiza Gonzalez's ABSOLUTELY EXQUISITE MOUTH. What an insanely gorgeous actress! And not a bad actress at that, but hardly good enough to salvage a trainwreck of a series idea like this. I'm not even sure this is any kind of issue with how well the work was adapted, because here it seems just the concept itself is plainly quite daft. Overambitious to the point of being painfully unrefined and uninteresting. The entire series feels like it struggles so mightily to explain the concepts that the story just isn't interesting anymore, and none of the blatantly contrived dramatic mechanisms fit in a way that engages the viewer. This is like sitting at the dinner table and listening to your 14 year old nerd cousin rattle off his latest role-playing game campaign idea he plagiarized from a video-game he'd been playing, cringing and begging for it to end. If you're going to write a sci-fi that needs to be a saga because it takes place over the span of 400+ years, then you need to do it with a lot more craft than this, because this series is going nowhere fast. The idea itself is lackluster. Someone aims a satellite at the Sun, which supposedly amplifies its signal to an extraterrestial race 4 lightyears away in a 3 star system, presumably Alpha Centauri, since it is the only documented system which fits this description within 4 lightyears distance. They make contact with an alien species called the San-Ti, who apparently have faced many extinction events on their own homeworld over the span of millions of years and have thereby come into possession of technology so advanced it allows them to communicate at sub-light speed, going so far as to project whatever images they want onto humans, able to make supercomputers the size of protons that propel themselves faster than light and that grow large enough to encircle the entire Earth and block out the sky, and supposedly, despite many great cataclysms (which apparently weren't so cataclysmic since they went on and on...) were able to build an entire interstellar fleet that can travel at 1% the speed of light all the way to Earth. All this to say that in about 440 years after first contact, 400 years known publicly by the masses of humanity, some aliens would be arriving to conquer the Earth. Ok. That's some ground to cover in ABSOLUTE BOREDOM. This means the only projected excitement until then is that we watch humans dig a really big figurative trench? No idea where they're going with this, but season 1 was utterly a forgettable SNOREFEST. Add some very tenous physics into the mix, in the form of humans lining up a chain of nuclear warheads in space to propel a solar sail (bro... all that would do is melt the solar sail and obliterate the probe, use your freakin' brain...), or making a supercomputer by having a million soldiers hold some picket signs and flip them back and forth, possibly utterly at random, to come up with some exact, obscur calculation (literally as if the only function of this was for the visual impact of seeing a million dudes fliping binary-colored picket signs en masse, since the concept is clearly nonsensical in the extreme...). Introducing a dramatic mechanism in the form of a forlorn lover stricken by terminal illness who heroicly offers his living brain for experimentation. Trying to make the entire plot mysterious by burying it under 40-odd years of an omniscient secret society that can make itself invisile to cameras, and knows everything whenever it is deemed it would make the plot more interesting, but is utterly oblivious whenever it is deemed that there WOULD BE NO PLOT IF THEY KNEW EVERYTHING?... The entire thing reeks of amateurism. This seems to likely have originated from a book that fringe sci-fi readers have tried to forcefully hype, rather than a work that has gained momentum on the merit of its originality or genius. I might tune in for a second season just out of the sheer hope that it miraculously all comes together in some way that makes having invested all this time in such a disappointing first season worthwhile, but so far, this is NOT The Expanse. Not remotely. It's not even Star Trek The Next Generation, or even Bablyon 5, quite frankly. Doubt this would have been hyped if it were the product of a western mind, moreover since so much like it has already been written by western authors. I REALLY strongly feel that being of Chinese origin is the ONLY thing this story has going for it. All the more power to you if that's your thing, but honestly, I don't think ""exoticism"" really applies to writing, particularly of the sci-fi or fantasy varieties, which really should always be cultureless in essence to begin with.A trio of Game of Thrones actors to see here, if that's your thing, but the real talk of the town is Eiza Gonzalez. Again, WHAT an UTTERLY EXQUISITE MOUTH on the young woman. Just a gorgeous creature, and one of the more interesting and engaging actors herein.Again, I will glady eat my words and feel like my screentime has been refunded if this somehow shapes into anything actually interesting and original in future seasons, but so far all it has done is to make me lose interest in the books altogether, on the assumption that they're anything like what is being presented here.I'll give it 3 stars out of 10, one to represent each of the bodies in the ""3 Body Problem"", so we can call it the ""3 Star Problem"", to be nice and gimmicky like most of this story's plot devices..."	sci fi enthusiast hear book long prior netflix series quite hopeful great sci fi bad concept quite braindead along small concept within make whole aside bunch contrive nonsensical drama mechanism terminally ill dude love lead physicist character destine supposedly key player interstellar war save human race happen good drink buddy like originally storyboard episode scooby doo something save grace series eiza gonzalez absolutely exquisite mouth insanely gorgeous actress bad actress hardly good enough salvage trainwreck series idea like even sure kind issue well work adapt seem concept plainly quite daft overambitious point painfully unrefine uninteresting entire series feel like struggle mightily explain concept story interest anymore none blatantly contrive dramatic mechanism fit way engage viewer like sit dinner table listen year old nerd cousin rattle late role play game campaign idea plagiarize video game play cringe beg end go write sci fi need saga take place span year need lot craft series go nowhere fast idea lackluster someone aim satellite sun supposedly amplify signal extraterrestial race lightyear away star system presumably alpha centauri since document system fit description within lightyear distance make contact alien species call san ti apparently face many extinction event homeworld span million year thereby come possession technology advance allow communicate sub light speed go far project whatever image want onto human able make supercomputer size proton propel fast light grow large enough encircle entire earth block sky supposedly despite many great cataclysm apparently cataclysmic since go able build entire interstellar fleet travel speed light way earth say year first contact year know publicly mass humanity alien would arrive conquer earth ok grind cover absolute boredom mean project excitement watch human dig really big figurative trench idea go season utterly forgettable snorefest add tenous physics mix form human line chain nuclear warhead space propel solar sail bro would melt solar sail obliterate probe use freakin brain make supercomputer million soldier hold picket sign flip back forth possibly utterly random come exact obscur calculation literally function visual impact see million dude flip binary color picket sign en masse since concept clearly nonsensical extreme introduce dramatic mechanism form forlorn lover stricken terminal illness heroicly offer live brain experimentation try make entire plot mysterious bury odd year omniscient secret society make invisile camera know everything whenever deem would make plot interest utterly oblivious whenever deem would plot know everything entire thing reek amateurism seem likely originate book fringe sci fi reader try forcefully hype rather work gain momentum merit originality genius might tune second season sheer hope miraculously come together way make invest time disappoint first season worthwhile far expanse remotely even star trek next generation even bablyon quite frankly doubt would hype product western mind moreover since much like already write western author really strongly feel chinese origin thing story go power thing honestly think exoticism really apply write particularly sci fi fantasy variety really always cultureless essence begin trio game throne actor see thing real talk town eiza gonzalez utterly exquisite mouth young woman gorgeous creature one interest engage actor herein glady eat word feel like screentime refund somehow shape anything actually interest original future season far do make lose interest book altogether assumption anything like present give star one represent body body problem call star problem nice gimmicky like story plot device

Like any long term fan I was concerned and skeptical it won't be as good as you hope but it certainly did not disappoint, really looking forward to how they expand on the world they have created in future seasons also looking forward to seeing how the characters develop over time and the introduction of more lore and easter eggs from the various game titles, no spoilers in this review want to say if you are a fan of the franchise you should absolutely watch this show!

2	3 episodes and hold on simply because I had nothing to do. The dialogue seemed very short from reality. Characters seem disconnected, but the TV show as a whole, had an intriguing truth behind it. The plot seemed funny so stayed.Then the plot turned out to be secondary and I found a true rarity nowadays. The script is implacable and everything started to make sense.It has a bigger plot than a stalker woman who was already a huge plot to be explored. The main character has so many layers that you just start to understand them by episode 4.And let's not forget the homage to PTA and the perfect Magnolia. That was beyond magnificent. Aimee's cover, the sequences, and the shocking images all in all give us the true that we didn't want to see cause we were so focused on what we believed was the main goal of the TV show. And that's life as well.You won't find Hollywood techniques here. It's just a smart and ironic development. Like life.	episode hold simply nothing dialogue seem short reality character seem disconnect tv show whole intrigue truth behind plot seem funny stay plot turn secondary find true rarity nowadays script implacable everything start make sense big plot stalker woman already huge plot explore main character many layer start understand episode let forget homage pta perfect magnolia beyond magnificent aimee cover sequence shock image give we true want see cause focus believe main goal tv show life well find hollywood technique smart ironic development like life
0	"Never in my life have I seen a worse show. The characters are shallow, have panic attacks literally ever 30 seconds, ignore actual patients and worry about each other, and the whole thing seems completely unrealistic. I wish Ellen Pompeo would stop with the George Bush impersonation and actually open her eyes. Just a terrible show. A better title would be ""girl doctors who complain about their sex lives and pretty much whore around the whole time"". If you want to see a near-perfect medical show, then hit up FOX on Tuesday nights to see a doctor at his finest: Hugh Laurie as Dr. Gregory House. Laurie's character, a pain-killer addicted M.D. with no regard for manners but a genius doctor, brings sheer brilliance to the screen, making the show unbelievably intense and suspenseful, yet manages to be completely realistic, and he ACTUALLY DEALS WITH HIS PATIENTS, rather than sleep with his co-workers. Grey's is just extremely sub-par, and fails to attract any demographic other than females who've had ""every kind of boyfriend."" In other words, ditch Grey's, watch House.

1	Watched the series over 3 days. I haven't read the books, but because I was confused by the plotting and lack of exposition, I had to read the Wiki entry to flesh out the plot. Production values were good and some of the set pieces were visually impressive. The characters were cliched and all huffy urgency and faux anger. Acting was ok. Luam Cunningham chewed a lot of scenes. Perhaps it lost something in transposing the novels from the original Chinese setting. By the end I didn't care about what was going to happen in the next episode, let alone centuries from now. I wanted to like it enough to see a second series but nah, I think I'll let it go.	watch series day read book confuse plot lack exposition read wiki entry flesh plot production value good set piece visually impressive character cliche huffy urgency faux anger act ok luam cunningham chew lot scene perhaps lose something transpose novel original chinese set end care go happen next episode let alone century want like enough see second series nah think let go

How many major crimes (nuke threat, multiple bombs, serial killers, etc. ) do do three rookies face in a year. It reminds me on how over the top Grey's Anatomy became. This leads me to season 3. Season 3 is just plain terrible. The show could not get more preschy. It becomes a Leftists wet dream. Every episode was worse than the last.

Can they act irrationally and make mistakes? You bet. Do they experience uncertainty, fear, anxiety and insecurity? Yes indeed. Does that mean ""Grey's Anatomy"" is true to life? No way.Not a MOMENT of this piece of Hollywood claptrap---either medical moments or personal moments---rings true. Surgical interns sleeping with attendings on the night before their first day on the job? Residents sleeping on gurneys in the hallway? Where are the call rooms? ATTENDINGS ARE SLEEPING IN THEM?

You speak when spoken to and you try not to look like an idiot. While these shows may attempt to show you what modern medicine LOOKS like, the resemblance to actual medical experience ends there.You want fantasy? Ditch ""Grey's Anatomy"" and watch ""Scrubs."" It's a comedy, and if you want realistic medical practice, you won't find it here. Nevertheless, although ""Scrubs"" makes no pretense of objective realism, I watch it and enjoy it. Why? Because ""Scrubs"", better than any of the other shows I've seen recently, and certainly a LOT better than ""Grey's Anatomy,"" actually manages to capture the inner life of medical residents by externalizing not the REALITY, but the SURreality you so often encounter or feel in the process of postgraduate medical education."	physician doctor human fallible everybody else without doubt trouble messy disorderly personal live absolutely act irrationally make mistake bet experience uncertainty fear anxiety insecurity yes indeed mean grey anatomy true life way moment piece hollywood claptrap either medical moment personal moment ring true surgical intern sleep attend night first day job resident sleep gurney hallway call room attend sleep attend sleep home surgeon take care seizure patient get trouble attend ask intern help instead call neurology consult attend surgeon shave scalp surgical patient nurse pay intern talk attend way intern never attend order intern case front intern never happen patient discharge month ago still hospital sing get people want get real strict peck order medical train whatever level hierarchy live terror everyone speak speak try look like idiot show may attempt show modern medicine look like resemblance actual medical experience end want fantasy ditch grey anatomy watch scrub comedy want realistic medical practice find nevertheless although scrub make pretense objective realism watch enjoy scrub well show see recently certainly lot well grey anatomy actually manage capture inner life medical resident externalize reality surreality often encounter feel process postgraduate medical education

The cinematography was exceptional! The fact it was filmed completely in black and white threw me at first, but soon I felt it was meant to be that way.I found myself hooked immediately, and had to watch from beginning to end in one go.No one can beat Matt Damon's performance in the original in my humble opinion, however this new take was a very close second. Bravo! Every performance was well cast with one exception.I could have easily given this version 10 stars, but, I am sorry to say, the characterization of Freddie Miles didn't work for me at all."	huge fan original skeptical series remake extremely surprise find ripley refresh new take original movie cinematography exceptional fact film completely black white throw first soon feel mean way find hook immediately watch begin end one go one beat matt damon performance original humble opinion however new take close second bravo every performance well cast one exception could easily give version star sorry say characterization freddie mile work
2	I had to give up rating TV dramas based on realism some time ago, as they have no basis in reality. The Rookie is quite entertaining as long as you suspend some beliefs. Nearly every show has a gunfight where the perps have automatic weapons and the cops have Berettas. None of the good guys get hit despite hiding behind a wooden box or the door of their cruiser, but they still hit the bad guys. Starting from that lowered standard, the characters are funny, likeable, and the plot lines entertaining. Season 3 started to dabble in social justice issues, but the writers tied it into a bad cop storyline and wrapped it up quickly. I like Nathan Fillion so I am a bit biased, but the show would work even without him.	give rat tv drama base realism time ago basis reality rookie quite entertain long suspend belief nearly every show gunfight perps automatic weapon cop beretta none good guy get hit despite hide behind wooden box door cruiser still hit bad guy start low standard character funny likeable plot line entertain season start dabble social justice issue writer tie bad cop storyline wrap quickly like nathan fillion bite bias show would work even without

2	From the trailers I was like man...idk if I'm gonna like this. Especially with how video game adaptations have gone in the past. But this show IMHO overall is an 8. Some episodes are a 6/10 but I think when you add up all of the storylines and the lore. It's fantastic and an absolute blast. You really start to relate to all of the main leads and see their character development throughout. Especially found myself interested in Norm and the vault storyline. It became super creepy and tense and my only wish is that that had more of a payoff.This is coming from someone who started with New Vegas, then fallout 3 and Fallout 4. This show was awesome.	trailer like man idk go to like especially video game adaptation go past show imho overall episode think add storyline lore fantastic absolute blast really start relate main lead see character development throughout especially find interest norm vault storyline become super creepy tense wish payoff come someone start new vegas fallout fallout show awesome
1	I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons of the rookie. An enjoyable show about an ageing rookie and his younger counterparts, who are coming to terms with being on real life patrol in LA and learning lessons daily. OK, it could be abit cringe at times but overall a fun show. Then, around season 3 it starts to fall off a cliff. Once it hits season 4 it's just insane. Apparently in LA there's no detectives as the patrol officers just decide to solve every case on their own. From murders to terrorism to going into another country to free a kidnapped colleague. They just do everything themselves. There is no protocol apparently. Nolan, the main protagonist of the show was a likeable character but hes too much by season 4. Mr moral highground. I still watch the show but mainly to laugh at how incredibley stupid its become.	really enjoy first season rookie enjoyable show age rookie young counterpart come term real life patrol la learn lesson daily ok could abit cringe time overall fun show around season start fall cliff hit season insane apparently la detective patrol officer decide solve every case murder terrorism go another country free kidnap colleague everything protocol apparently nolan main protagonist show likeable character he s much season mr moral highground still watch show mainly laugh incredibley stupid become
1	"I don't write many reviews, and honestly have little to say about this other than to express my wonder at why they would choose to make a ""Shogun"" of this caliber, and then jettison the essence of story itself? This is entertaining, and well made, the acting quite sound...but it is not Shogun. And this is not the usual trimming of events and characters that must accompany moving from the superior storytelling medium of books to film - this is changing characters completely, altering their motivations, the ""whys"" behind the ""whats."" Characters bear no resemblance to their written counterparts, and with their very character and motivations recast, the story loses its purpose and sense - it is an entirely different tale and lesson. And I can only wonder why, and marvel at what sort of hubristic arrogance leads these film makers and adaptive writers to do things like this. Do they really think they're a better story tellers than Clavell?

2	My guess is Grey's Anatomy is the best medical drama after House. It's the perfect mix of serious and funny. Last year,I came to home and I opened the TV while I was eating my cornflakes. I saw this series. I have been watcing it since that time. I still remember the first scene that I watched of the show was Derek telling Addison in 212 at Christmas time that Meredith's wasn't revenge, he fell in love with her. I would love to listen this show's soundtracks, I enjoy the new music and artists. My favorite actor was Sloan. I wish I had not died. Now,my favorite is Jo. She is success. I hope she does not die! For anyone who loves medical shows, drama and romance, this show is for you.

Portuguese was among the world's key languages in the 15th and 16th centuries, serving as the lingua franca in several regions, including in African and Asian countries.

2	"The series is visually stunning. The choice to shoot monochromatic in no way detracts from the location as some have stated, but instead greatly enhances and celebrates the landscapes and architecture of Italy. ""Black and White"" focuses on the detail rather than the color, highlighting every crease, corner, crack, and crevice like color photography never can. An equally important benefit is the fact the stream isn't burdened with chrominance, only luminance, and the reduced need for compression is on full display. I've never seen another streaming presentation that looks like Ripley.The writing is also exceptional, weaving an intricate yet comfortably engaging path for Ripley and those with whom he interacts. He's good yet flawed, evading detection as much via happenstance as skill. Even mundane details are well considered and presented, adding a level of verisimilitude rarely seen in modern storytelling.The entire cast is on point, with Andrew Scott's layered portrayal of Ripley's sociopathic neurosis leading the charge. The effortless manner in which he transitions between charming and disturbing is delightfully unsettling, yet the writing and direction are so skilled we find ourselves rooting for Ripley to succeed. In that sense it's an eight episode homage to the tension Hitchcock masterfully crafted in the scene in Psycho in which Norman awkwardly disposes of Marion Crane's car."	series visually stun choice shoot monochromatic way detract location state instead greatly enhance celebrate landscape architecture italy black white focus detail rather color highlight every crease corner crack crevice like color photography never equally important benefit fact stream burden chrominance luminance reduce need compression full display never see another stream presentation look like ripley write also exceptional weave intricate yet comfortably engage path ripley interact good yet flaw evade detection much via happenstance skill even mundane detail well consider present add level verisimilitude rarely see modern storytelle entire cast point andrew scott layer portrayal ripley sociopathic neurosis lead charge effortless manner transition charm disturb delightfully unsettle yet write direction skilled find root ripley succeed sense eight episode homage tension hitchcock masterfully craft scene psycho norman awkwardly dispose marion crane car
1	I have genuinely enjoyed this show and would rate the first two seasons at a solid 8. The plot and characters have been interesting and enjoyable overall.Season three, only a few episodes in, is a huge disappointment. Does every tv show and movie have to bend the knee to the so-called 'woke' agenda and relentlessly bombard its audience with political messaging? I can watch CNN for that.Come on, Hollywood, I want to be entertained, not indoctrinated. I'm sure you can come up with a more original storyline for this season.For this year, at least, I'm out.	genuinely enjoy show would rate first two season solid plot character interest enjoyable overall season three episode huge disappointment every tv show movie bend knee call wake agenda relentlessly bombard audience political message watch cnn come hollywood want entertain indoctrinate sure come original storyline season year least

0	The only thing 'captivating' about this true story is the fact that despite being given virtually every conceivable reason (other than actual physical violence) not to encourage Martha's mad behaviour, Donny can't seem to just tell her to piss off. Perhaps he doesn't need to say it in as many words but let's be reasonable here - just say no thank you.He cracks a sexually suggestive joke after she's showed up at his work every day for weeks and proven herself to be a delusional, compulsive liar.He goes to a cafe with her for lunch 'as friends' after she's made it painfully obvious that she thinks they're much more. Again, this woman is clearly mad but he still takes her to lunch.He has a cute moment on the bench outside his comedy club with her where he actually joins her in singing a romantic song. I don't care that he changed the words - that is moronic under the circumstances.She comes to his house under a false name and then sits at a bus stop across the road after he asks her not to sleep over. Instead of calling the police or ignoring her, he finally goes outside and WIPES HER NOSE WITH A TISSUE.Then he takes her home and has a nice fake breakup with her.All this while she's writing him hundreds of e-mails a day and clicking through/commenting on every piece of his social media.This is either the stupidest man on the planet or the stupidest plot of the decade or, like a sort of reverse-miracle, both. Whatever it is, it's maximal sub-par dredge dressed up as a 'modern emotional' thriller / drama / I'm sorry for everyone involved somehow. Watch Ripley instead. If you've seen Ripley, watch it again instead.	thing captivate true story fact despite give virtually every conceivable reason actual physical violence encourage martha mad behaviour donny seem tell piss perhaps need say many word let reasonable say thank crack sexually suggestive joke show work every day week prove delusional compulsive liar go cafe lunch friend make painfully obvious think much woman clearly mad still take lunch cute moment bench outside comedy club actually join sing romantic song care change word moronic circumstance come house false name sit bus stop across road ask sleep instead call police ignore finally go outside wipe nose tissue take home nice fake breakup write hundred e mail day click comment every piece social medium either stupid man planet stupidest plot decade like sort reverse miracle whatever maximal sub par dredge dress modern emotional thriller drama sorry everyone involve somehow watch ripley instead see ripley watch instead

THis is so very slow and so very boring. And the way its shot and the way the story is being told, I dont know how anyone could grow to care about any of these characters.So science is evolving in unpredictable ways. We have theories today that could explain such a thing..but nope, everyone just starts killing themselves because they are too rigid to open their minds up to new possibilites.It also kinda reminds me of this show where THe main character was arguing about God is Nowhere and God is now here. An interesting concept that goes nowhere.How could universe altering physics be tied to a chinese revoultion 50 years ago. It does not seem like it will get any better.	idk show go sure seem lot like old leave behind show watch year ago bunch people kill super bore slow bore way shoot way story tell do not know anyone could grow care character science evolve unpredictable way theory today could explain thing nope everyone start kill rigid open mind new possibilite also kinda remind show main character argue god nowhere god interest concept go nowhere could universe alter physics tie chinese revoultion year ago seem like get well
1	This show starts off as a great look at what it's like being a rookie on the streets. It was a well thought out script going through everyday situations, and dealing with police & public relations. Sadly it has morphed into another shoot-em-up cop show where there is a gun fight in every episode and people are getting shot left and right. It's a common trap that police shows fall into, and it is more a sign of lazy writing and unimaginative conflict resolution on the part of the writers. We don't need to have a massive crisis every episode to keep the show interesting, but thats whats happening. It is sad to see a show that had such a promising start fall squarely in the trap of needing to have a shootout so often that the whole show becomes completely unbelievable.	show start great look like rookie street well think script go everyday situation deal police public relation sadly morph another shoot em cop show gun fight every episode people get shoot leave right common trap police show fall sign lazy write unimaginative conflict resolution part writer need massive crisis every episode keep show interest that s what s happen sad see show promise start fall squarely trap need shootout often whole show become completely unbelievable

2	"I mean it, this is by far the best video game adaptation ever. It's actually still very hard to believe that it's as good as it is. It's in my opinion far superior to the overhyped, critically acclaimed TLOU adaptation by HBO (see my review of that show for why).Our main characters 1. Lucy MacLean: Ella Purnell is an absolute treat, her acting is fantastic and her giant eyes and soft voice fit perfectly with the character she's playing. She looks like a vault-tec bobble head turned into the cutest girl in the best possible way. She's not the stereotypical Disney strong woman trope that everyone is sick and tired off. Instead she is still incredible capable and combat trained but also very femine at the same time. Generally she's not unrealistically strong in combat. She's not throwing around men twice her size with ease, but she can defend herself, is a very good shot and uses her wit, charm and also her ""lawful good"" personality to survive. Strangely, everyone but Maximus seems to ignore her good looks in the wasteland. When I imagine it's rare to see someone that pretty. It's a breath of fresh air to see a woman as the protagonist be feminine in a show again.2. The Ghoul AKA Cooper Howard: Mr Goggins delivers absolute gold as always. The ghoul is a relentlessly brutal character who has at the start lost most of his humanity. We later learn his drive to live comes from the fact that he's looking for his family. The acting is incredible as always. The makeup and cgi for his ghoul version look great (maybe a little smooth). Cooper has no chill, he's not just quick to defend himself. But also to kill innocents with no remorse. 200 years in the savage wastelands have turned him into something that isn't a monster but has little humanity left. No sympathy for anyone and a singular drive. To the point where he eats former friends for substanance, kills those offering him a job. And even after Lucy shows him a kindness, ""her golden rule"" (treat others as you'd want to be treated) and saves him after he tries to sell her to organ harvesters, tortures her and even cuts her finger off. He murders a young boy in cold blood infront of his father and child sister, after he taunts him about having murdered his older brother earlier. Goating the kid into pulling a rifle. When in reality, a rifle bullet seems to literally do nothing to Cooper. Which is kind of a problem, Ghouls in the show have rapid healing abilities and Cooper esp seems to be indistructable. But the rules aren't clear.3. Maximus: Aaron Moten's Maximus is probably the weakest link. Mainly because his acting feels so inconsistent and at first I couldn't put my finger on it. It's like he's cycling through emotions or facial expressions constantly and it's very distracting. In more emotional scenes this kinda looks unhinged. For example, the interrogation scene he looks like he's about to snap, to a point that I thought it was the point. That he was going to snap and turn into some brotherhood zealot radical and an antagonist. Use everyone around him as a ladder to reach his goals. Instead he's an insecure guy looking for a place to belong and looking to be a hero. To save people. Which is fine. Great even. But his acting just never felt right. And I think I get why that is after having seen some interviews with him. He's very, very feminine in his mannerisms and facial expressions in real life. And in the show his character is trying to act a lot more masculine and straight. But his true self keeps breaking through his acting, the behavior I confused for cycling through emotions was him making his natural facial emotions but then changing them to fit his role more, but not always being able to keep the face straight. He will constantly slightly protrude his upper or lower lip and have this weird stare in certain scenes. One of the worst examples and also one of the worst scenes in the whole show is the scene where Lucy offers to sleep with him. And I think he's supposed to look shocked, a little scared and shy. But instead he comes off like he's a little girl, weirdly pouts his lips and pulls his shoulders together etc. And the dialogue being ridicilously infantile doesn't help ""with some guys their penis grows and explodes like a pimple"" or something. What? He's an adult man. He lives in barracks with men, women, trans people etc In fact in one scene a guy is clearly mastrubating under the covers. There is NO way in hell a man wrote that line. In fact, right after writing that I checked the writer for the episode. And it's a lady called Karey Dornetto. They really need to stop this nonsense where they have every episode written by a different writer. It makes the show/story feel super inconsistent.The writing It's really good at many parts.. For example a lot of the comedic bits and humor were great. Some of the lines are fantastic. But it's also horrifically bad at other times. And I mean beyond how weird it is that Lucy would casually asks Maximus to sleep with her in a room with a giant window, in a strange place, surrounded by strange people. I thought it was funny she was asking about sperm count etc in the vault. But that made sense. Just randomly inviting people to have sex with no protection etc in that weird condition? Was that supposed to be empowering or something? Or just a set up for the pimple penis joke or Maximus later asking if she'd like to ""explode his D now."" Beyond all that, the motivations for NONE of the antagonists make any sense1. The corporations: Vault-tec wants to wipe out all the competition, on a larger scale. Wipe out literaly every faction, country, group, political entity and organization so there won't be anyone to fight or compete anymore. Total domination by one group, one faction: Vault-Tec. How? By a nuclear holocaust. By dropping the bombs themselves. But that's just part of the plan. They know it won't wipe out everyone. Their plan is to, wait for it..... Wait it out.. their plan is that everyone on the surface eventually dies. How? Time. But .. that makes no sense? They'd multiply and start rebuilding naturally, right? Nope.. don't think about it. ""The greatest weapon of mass destruction is time"" according to vault-tec in this show. But it gets better. Vault-Tec then invites all their competitors.. to join in on the fun. Because obviously the best way to end competition. Is to tell your competition of your plans an invite them to join you in the new future you're planning to create. But wasn't the point .. that there'd be no more factio- SHHHH, DON'T THINK ABOUT IT! Oh and the vault experiments.. well those are now made up by different corporations for their own end goals, that they are allowed to choose for some reason. In the game lore it's the enclave who was convinced the nuclear war would was inevitable and would make the world uninhabitable, so they planned to create multi generation star ships and colonize different planets. Most of the vaults were meant as experiments to see how people would last in long term confinement and or to create some super human species etc etc and a small amount of them were control groups and thus had no experiments etc going on.Listen, I'm fine with the corpos dropping the bomb, even though it ruins the ambigiouty we had about who dropped them. I don't mind vault tec's somewhat cartoony power hunger and motivations. That's totally fine in fallout. But the bad writing, the plotholes, the inconsistency .. that's unacceptable. These people are supposed to be professional writers, and they couldn't come up with something better? OR just stuck to the game lore? Same for characters, it's ok for them to be whacky and over the top. It's fallout. But there is a limit to what works and what is just infantile and dumb.2. Lucy's parents: So Lucy's dad is a lower level cog in the Vault-Tec machine and he's assigned to live his life out in a vault, herding the flock. All the Vault 31 people are cryopod people from before the bomb. This doesn't seem enough of a revelation for vault 32 to break out into a full on civil war and massacre each other. But that does seem to be the extent of it.Moldaver's talk about Lucy's mom Rose was cringe worthy. Oh, how smart and mary sue she was. She inferred from the vault losing water, that it was being siphoned. She didn't assume it was a leak or anything. No it had to be that civilization had restarted and their water was being siphoned by them. How did they siphon the .. water of a vault? Wouldn't that be a design fla-- don't think about it! You're not supposed to think! Look, I'm not looking for much logic, but, what? And then when she tells her husband, and he says .. probably just a leak. She figures he's must be hiding something? In a vault full of people that are bred to be docile and nice to each other? She has no idea what's there. It might be a leak, it might be a bunch of monsters or raiders, the radiation is still there etc etc. What does she do? She takes her children and .. leaves the vault. She takes her children to an irradiated wasteland to live in an irradiated town among mutants, raiders, murderers, and under constant threat of monsters, other factions, radiation etc It's implied she has a romantic relationship with Moldaver and that Shadysands was this super great, perfect place where civilization had thrived etc. What? I mean sure there was more safety than other places and the NCR was in power etc. But it was still the fallout world with raiders and tons of hostile factions, cannibals, ghouls, monsters, radiation in every part of the world etc.The father than, get this. Goes and takes the children. And then. He NUKES the town. How does a mid level management tool from a corpo nuke a whole town you ask? Don't. Because we're never told. He just does.There is much more, but it appears we've run out of the characer limit. Overall, I really enjoyed the show. But it could have been so much better."	mean far good video game adaptation ever actually still hard believe good opinion far superior overhype critically acclaim tlou adaptation hbo see review show

2	After two episodes, this has me hooked. Great production value, good plot with a somewhat historical accurate depiction of the time. Haven't had that much from this perspective and it feels really well made.I kinda get the negative reviews about them not speaking Portuguese at all. It confused me as well at first.But I guess these people cannot think very far: the entire show would be subbed if they did not do that. Because no one spoke English in Japan back then. All they knew was Portuguese and here and there a bit of Spanish. Thanks to the missionaries from both countries.Try marketing a show that is subbed in its entirety to a Western / US audience. Good luck getting that green lit at all.Can't wait to see the rest of the show!	two episode hook great production value good plot somewhat historical accurate depiction time much perspective feel really well make kinda get negative review speak portuguese confuse well first guess people think far entire show would sub one speak english japan back know portuguese bite spanish thank missionary country try market show sub entirety western us audience good luck get green light wait see rest show
1	The final two seaons completely ruins this show. The first four seasons of brilliantly complex and brutal political drama, are followed by season 5 and 6 where the show still tries but looses it's way a little. In season 7 and 8 it decends into a typical hollywood blend of cliche ridden action film and trivial romance. It doesn't even succeed very well on those two parameters seen in isolation. There is much better action and romance out there. The only reason to carry on watching at this point is to get conclusions on the dense story line and character development one has invested in over the previous 6 seasons. Over its final two seaons, the show however lets down almost every single story arch and becomes entirely plot driven. The characters turn into hollow shells of their former selves and their actions hugely inconsistent. All the decisions they take and everything else that happens is entirely written to drive the plot forward in a rush towards the ending. It leaves you cheated and hungry, yet my score is 6 of 10 based on the brilliance the show was for most of its first two thirds.	final two seaon completely ruin show first four season brilliantly complex brutal political drama follow season show still try loose way little season decend typical hollywood blend cliche ride action film trivial romance even succeed well two parameter see isolation much well action romance reason carry watch point get conclusion dense story line character development one invest previous season final two seaon show however let almost every single story arch become entirely plot drive character turn hollow shell former self action hugely inconsistent decision take everything else happen entirely write drive plot forward rush towards end leave cheat hungry yet score base brilliance show first two third
1	The past few seasons have gotten progressively worse. The March 26 episode was hopeless. I was already confused by who is pregnant by whom & no longer even care, but the last episode was totally disconnected from the story lines I have been trying to follow. Now it turns out Teddy is also gay? Where the hell did that come from? And Richard & his wife have a good laugh over her buying an entire hospital for revenge...because disrupting lives is so humorous? Meredith still loves her intern...her character is a little old for that. Frankly, I just don't like any of those people.	past season get progressively bad march episode hopeless already confuse pregnant long even care last episode totally disconnect story line try follow turn teddy also gay hell come richard wife good laugh buy entire hospital revenge disrupt live humorous meredith still love intern character little old frankly like people

It's some while since I read the original book so some of the detail is a bit hazy but it doesn't trouble me that the screenwriters have invented several new characters - they are all excellent, especially the scientist played by the mesmerizing Jess Hong.I have watched ""Three Body"", the 30-episode Chinese version of the story and, good though that production was, the Netflix version definitely gets my vote.Cixin's ""Three-Body Problem"" trilogy is brilliant science fiction.

2	"After reading some of the reviews here, I'm dismayed by the people comparing this version of The Talented Mr. Ripley to ""the original"" 1999 movie-many who panned this version incidentally. The true original version is the 1955 novel by Patricia Highsmith, which I have read, re-read, and highly recommend, and the bar against which every subsequent adaptation should be measured. To its credit, the plot of this version tacks truer to the novel than the 1999 movie, although every adaptation, to include the original 1960 movie adaptation, Plein Soleil (Purple Noon), takes artistic license in putting their own spin on the story. I have enjoyed all 3 film adaptations for their distinctive takes on the original story. Anthony Minghella's 1999 version in glorious color was a visual feast and well acted by Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, and the brilliant Phillip Seymour Hoffman. That version emphasized the class differences and the envy for the kind of Bon vivant lifestyle personified by Dickie and desired by Tom. But this version, in stark, gorgeous black and white, was more psychological, took its time, and reminded me of one of Antonioni's B&W trilogy (L'Avventura, La Notte, & L'Eclisse). The prolonged scenes of Tom trying to dispose of Dickie's body and the dingy reminded me of Coen Brothers' black humor. But it's not quite as good as it could have been. Andrew Scott, as much as I like his acting, which is brilliant (Sherlock), is quite a bit older than Tom Ripley of the novel. Johnny Flynn was kind of an enigma. On the other hand Dakota Fanning as Marge was more like Marge of the novel and perfect. Eliot Sumner as Freddie Miles was a strange choice to say the least. It's not perfect, but the real star of this miniseries is the cinematography, which conveyed both the beauty and coldness of the original story. I didn't want to see a remake of the 1999 movie but rather a unique vision for the original story, and on that level this version succeeded for me."	read review dismay people compare version talente mr ripley original movie many pan version incidentally true original version novel patricia highsmith read read highly recommend bar every subsequent adaptation measure credit plot version tack truer novel movie although every adaptation include original movie adaptation plein soleil purple noon take artistic license put spin story enjoy film adaptation distinctive take original story anthony minghella version glorious color visual feast well act matt damon jude law gwyneth paltrow brilliant phillip seymour hoffman version emphasize class difference envy kind bon vivant lifestyle personify dickie desire tom version stark gorgeous black white psychological take time remind one antonioni b w trilogy l avventura la notte l eclisse prolong scene tom try dispose dickie body dingy remind coen brother black humor quite good could andrew scott much like act brilliant sherlock quite bite old tom ripley novel johnny flynn kind enigma hand dakota fan marge like marge novel perfect eliot sumner freddie mile strange choice say least perfect real star miniserie cinematography convey beauty coldness original story want see remake movie rather unique vision original story level version succeed
0	Had huge expectations from David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Thoroughly disappointed.I work in a start-up where we work with resource crunch, no money, no facilities, literally nothing and we still make decent products, provide good customer service, take feedback and incorporate it and do a good job. What I fail to understand is, how such big companies & production houses with so much money and resources fail to produce something decent.The series with the Chinese elements were really good including the actors. The rest is all crap. Couldn't tolerate other main actors and their acting. There are so many flaws like bad story telling, no depth in the story or characters, bad dialogues, no sci-fi but magic, bad casting, bad acting and not a single moment of thrill except the first scene in China. The list goes on. Instead of wasting time on watching the series, I would have been better-off reading the novel!	huge expectation david benioff b weiss thoroughly disappoint work start work resource crunch money facility literally nothing still make decent product provide good customer service take feedback incorporate good job fail understand big company production house much money resource fail produce something decent series chinese element really good include actor rest crap tolerate main actor act many flaw like bad story tell depth story character bad dialogue sci fi magic bad cast bad act single moment thrill except first scene china list go instead waste time watch series would well read novel
2	In the modern age where police officers are either demonised or put on a pedestal, it's good to have a show that doesn't do either.

1	Really good except for the last episode. The motivation for the corporate types to do what they did is just not realistic. It's silly even. The writers let themselves down with that episode. There's no way a group of corporate leaders would intentionally nuke the world so they can do social experiments in a bunker. It doesn't make any sense at all. It's amazing that this was the best idea they could think of.Good up to that point. Interesting enough to considerActing was good and the main characters likable with good character development throughout.Some nudity in the show that was entirely unnecessary.	really good except last episode motivation corporate type realistic silly even writer let episode way group corporate leader would intentionally nuke world social experiment bunker make sense amaze good idea could think good point interest enough consideracte good main character likable good character development throughout nudity show entirely unnecessary
1	'Baby Reindeer' is a great mini series that delves into some dark but real life events. It is an incredibly personal story from Richard Gadd's life.A lot of themes within this series are quite unique and not often represented well by other media products. Dissecting the idea of 'the perfect victim' and trauma responses, this mini series effectively represents a much more realistic depiction of sexual abuse and stalking. Furthermore, there is a lot of great LGBTQ+ representation throughout the whole narrative.The lighting is one filmmaking element that captured my attention. It is used to reflect a prominent emotion or action being represented on screen. Also, the use of typing message transitions were very effective. Please check this out if you can handle a heavy story!-Sent from my iPhone.	baby reindeer great mini series delve dark real life event incredibly personal story richard gadd life lot theme within series quite unique often represent well medium product dissect idea perfect victim trauma response mini series effectively represent much realistic depiction sexual abuse stalk furthermore lot great lgbtq representation throughout whole narrative light one filmmaking element capture attention use reflect prominent emotion action represent screen also use type message transition effective please check handle heavy story send iphone

0	Grey's Anatomy used to be my favourite show but after Derek died every episode is a struggle to watch. It has become a soap opera all about the personal lives of the characters, it's not a medical drama anymore. Meredith has become flat and the remaining characters are either boring or overly annoying. It would have been a mistake not to mention how much annoying and irrelevant character Maggie is. I have to mute my TV every time she throws a childish tantrum for no reason.	grey anatomy use favourite show derek die every episode struggle watch become soap opera personal live character medical drama anymore meredith become flat remain character either bore overly annoy would mistake mention much annoy irrelevant character maggie mute tv every time throw childish tantrum reason
2	Fallout, it seems that things are turning around for video game adaptions. Fallout manages to take the silly, gruesome, complex and chaotic world of the Fallout games and turn it into a compelling tv show. Not a small feat. If anything, the amount of switching in tone this show has it could've gone so much worse.But it's delicate balance of funny, silly, awkward and gruesome is what makes this one of the more unique shows in a while.As a big Fallout fan, especially New Vegas. I had set a low bar for this, how are they going to pull off such a massive world, and such a weird one too. Having Jonathan Nolan behind it gave me some hope. And Goggins helps, as always. But still, I gave it a low chance of succes. Behold my surprise when I binged it in a couple days. This is a genuinely good show. But it took some adjusting.Primarily it leans into the silly *much* more, and it's foundation, art direction and tone of voice lies in the Fallout 4 game mainly. Which it a bit more silly than Fallout 3 or NV who in general are a bit more serious, gritty, and more depressing (as worlds).Directing is great so far. I have some bad memories of Westworld action scenes, especially in later seasons, Nolan is not good at that because it was always a hilarious bullet fest that stood in awkward contrast to the rest of the show. But in Fallout, first off, the firefights and action scenes are perfectly good, and the bit of silliness that they have works because of the universe it is set in.And that takes me to the bit that I needed to adjust to. This is by all aspect, a video game tv show, and it plays by video game RULES. As in it has a lot more comically unrealistic scenes. Whilst both being exceptionally gruesome and gore-y. Therefore it might just be the best video game tv show adaption ever. Because it's not trying to be real life, it's not trying to ground it in our realities. It 's creating a fictious world, and fictious rules to align perfectly with the fictitious rules of games and gaming in general. This is what I needed to accept and once I did I was really enjoying it.Music, pretty perfect, the expected scores. Effective when used for sure. The oldies music really lands the show and puts it right inside the Fallout universe. I could sing all of them by heart. The fact it's the actual music you also hear in the games is icing on the cake.The story is a great way to show the diverse and huge world of Fallout, and we've yet touched the surface. So much to explore and this gave a taste of each. It could go on for a good while.Lore-wise minor changes here and there and mostly some creative choices in certain attitudes and portrayals, but it all made sense to me. None of it stuck out to me as betraying the games in terms of how things work. The BoS are a bit less cool than they should, and more incompetent here, but it's only a division of it. Not the entire thing, so it's easy to look past.Also gore, man, they went all in. And I love them for it. Fallout games are gore-y and they don't stray one bit from that. That's what this show is, it's honest to the game, to an extend I've never seen before.The pacing, it moves along fast, and characters do too, (fast travel..). What I didn't love as much was the coincidental nature of it all, it made the world feel very small and compact when everyone seems to meet up around some random corner every odd episode. If anything, that's my complaint so far, is that the world feels somewhat small. And everything around tends to feel like set dressing very quickly.That being said, for now, Season 1. They really delivered a good time, and I can't wait for S2.	fallout seem thing turn around video game adaption fallout manage take silly gruesome complex chaotic world fallout game turn compel tv show small feat anything amount switch tone show could go much bad delicate balance funny silly awkward gruesome make one unique show big fallout fan especially new vegas set low bar go pull massive world weird one jonathan nolan behind give hope goggin help always still give low chance succe behold surprise binge couple day genuinely good show take adjust primarily lean silly much foundation art direction tone voice lie fallout game mainly bite silly fallout nv general bite serious gritty depress world direct great far bad memory westworld action scene especially late season nolan good always hilarious bullet f stand awkward contrast rest show fallout first firefight action scene perfectly good bite silliness work universe set take bite need adjust aspect video game tv show play video game rule lot comically unrealistic scene whilst exceptionally gruesome gore therefore might good video game tv show adaption ever try real life try grind reality create fictious world fictious rule align perfectly fictitious rule game game general need accept really enjoy music pretty perfect expect score effective use sure oldie music really land show put right inside fallout universe could sing heart fact actual music also hear game ice cake story great way show diverse huge world fallout yet touch surface much explore give taste could go good lore wise minor change mostly creative choice certain attitude portrayal make sense none stick betray game term thing work bos bite less cool incompetent division entire thing easy look past also gore man go love fallout game gore stray one bite show honest game extend never see pace move along fast character fast travel love much coincidental nature make world feel small compact everyone seem meet around random corner every odd episode anything complaint far world feel somewhat small everything around tend feel like set dress quickly say season really deliver good time wait

Toshiro Mifune with the pathetic, crappy ""actors"" in this ""new"" version.Annoying to see so much hype from the young generation, for a mediocre, even miserable remake, who throw the real story to the garbage bin, yet get acclaimed with 9 or even 10 stars of 10... Obvious these peoples never bother to read the book, and for sure, they never watched Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune version - real actors, unlike the pathetic clowns on this production... CGI effects and ""diversity"" crews will not bring authenticity, nor quality, alone, if it is no talent and no respect for the book who brought this story to the light.I stopped watching after the first episode, so much it hurt my expectations...

1	"After binge watching all episode, here is my honest review of Season 1 of Fallout.I've heard of the games, but never got around to actually play them, so my review is based with little to no influence from the games.Fallout is a decent and quite captivating series, only let down by some bad main casting choices, except Goggins, and sometimes wtf moments (like that doctor not getting hit by a single bullet from a robot controlled sentry gatling gun) That was outright the dumbest thing I've ever seen on screen.Episodes 1-3 starts off slow and I felt at times I wanted to stop, but I managed through, and the flashback scenes actually help me keep my interest even more mainly because of Cooper's backstory.The series really kicks off from EP04 and I didn't feel like there was any kind of filler moments, which really made the viewing experience much more to the point.I loved Goggins character Cooper, and his backstory is really the drive in Fallout. Actually the only character I cared and rooted for.Lucy on the other hand, was 'meh' at best. Her dialogue delivery felt sooo... ""robotic"". Character was fine, and I like that they didn't make her to much of ""power girl"" and showed her moments of mistakes.Maximus - I just didn't care for. Dude looks dumb founded half the time. His squeaky voice doesn't fit his character at all. And as of character development goes (almost none btw), I wish he developed a bit more to a badass after all he went through, but no. He remained the same all through.Oh yeah - and don't get me started on that non-binary character. I almost turned it off when the pronouns came out, but luckily her screen time is limited and is only in 2 episode.Overall Fallout is a well made series with a intriguing plot and some decent VFX. Of what I know about the games, this honestly might be the one of the best game to screen adaptation I've seen.7/10."	binge watch episode honest review season fallout hear game never get around actually play review base little influence game fallout decent quite captivate series let bad main cast choice except goggin sometimes wtf moment like doctor get hit single bullet robot control sentry gatling gun outright dumbest thing ever see screen episode start slow feel time want stop manage flashback scene actually help keep interest even mainly cooper backstory series really kick ep feel like kind filler moment really make view experience much point love goggin character cooper backstory really drive fallout actually character care root lucy hand meh good dialogue delivery feel sooo robotic character fine like make much power girl show moment mistake maximus care dude look dumb find half time squeaky voice fit character character development go almost none btw wish develop bite badass go remain oh yeah get start non binary character almost turn pronoun come luckily screen time limit episode overall fallout well make series intrigue plot decent vfx know game honestly might one good game screen adaptation see
2	"This adaptation is largely faithful to the book, if your definition of faithful is ""major events that happened in the books also happened in this show"". The whole thing is rushed, and there is no time to let the events sink in. The first episode already covers half the first book. The mystery of what's behind the scientists' deaths and the thrill of the main characters uncovering the culprit are missing entirely from the show. The divide between the two branches of the three body organization is completely omitted. And where are the pendulums? The hard science that makes the source material so appealing is also ""less hard"" here. Two episodes in, we've already arrived at the famous ""Do Not Answer"" scene and know it's aliens. Despite having only 8 episodes, episodes 6 and 7 are nonsense fillers and by episode 8 we're already at book 2.I don't mind the screenwriters adapting characters to a more international audience, splitting and combining some main characters so they can interact with each other because you can't really have an inner monologue like in a fiction. But it makes zero sense that ""everybody knows everybody"" or that some early- to mid-thirties are heads of research centers. The epic feeling is gone because the show is made too UK-centric. Different genders and ethnic groups are ""represented"", but somehow they all have a British (Oxford) upbringing. Major world powers including the US, Japan, continental Europe, and Chinese-Chinese (not British Chinese) are not represented at all. This work is supposed to be an epic that spans the globe, and spans centuries. Yet watching the ""Oxford Five""'s relationship issues, it feels like teenage drama instead.While I might sound negative, this work is miles ahead of whatever's crapping out of Disney/Marvel/SW these days. The CGI is fantastic, especially when it comes to visualizing the VR world. The C******* Revolution backstory is meticulously filmed, and the entire Chinese storyline, however short it is, is spoken in Chinese. I am delighted to see Chinese Sci-Fi being adapted for Western audience, hence +1 star for representation. Nonetheless, as with most shows these days though, please hire more competent writers."	adaptation largely faithful book definition faithful major event happen book also happen show whole thing rush time let event sink first episode already cover half first book mystery behind scientist death thrill main character uncover culprit miss entirely show divide two branch three body organization completely omit pendulum hard science make source material appeal also less hard two episode already arrive famous answer scene know alien despite episode episode nonsense filler episode already book mind screenwriter adapt character international audience split combine main character interact really inner monologue like fiction make zero sense everybody know everybody early mid thirty head research center epic feel go show make uk centric different gender ethnic group represent somehow british oxford upbringe major world power include us japan continental europe chinese chinese british chinese represent work suppose epic span globe span century yet watch oxford five relationship issue feel like teenage drama instead might sound negative work mile ahead whatever crap disney marvel sw day cgi fantastic especially come visualize vr world c revolution backstory meticulously film entire chinese storyline however short speak chinese delight see chinese sci fi adapt western audience hence star representation nonetheless show day though please hire competent writer
1	I feel very conflicted on this series.The first couple of episodes were very gripping and I was intrigued to see what would play out in the rest of the episodes.Martha was an interesting character despite her very serious issues and very well acted, you could believe you could meet someone like her at some point in life. I was curious to see where the dynamic between Donny and Martha was going, but after the 2nd half of the show I feel it lost it's direction and gave very mixed signals on what it was trying to say.Trying to relate to Donny and his nuances of why he let things continue on for as long as he did is a bit tricky. On one hand trauma is very complex and him trying to keep the peace with Martha, even though she was seriously escalating in her behaviours, you could relate they had a fundamental self hate that tied them together and why perhaps they became enthralled as people.But having her assault your partner and not report it? And then the story with the older man? Was it that he really thought he was going to further his career so he continued going to his place or did he hate himself that much that he let himself get assaulted so many times? And then he goes back to his in the last ep to make friends? It's a story of Stockholm syndrome and it doesn't leave a good feeling once finishing the series.If the main actor went through all these events and none of them are dramatised for the story then I do hope he's in long term therapy as this is a story that is not to be promoted for happy viewing.I feel the show is a case of human behaviour and how people are complex on their reasons to why they are the way they are but I don't think I'll be watching this again.	feel conflict series first couple episode grip intrigue see would play rest episode martha interest character despite serious issue well act could believe could meet someone like point life curious see dynamic donny martha go nd half show feel lose direction give mix signal try say try relate donny nuance let thing continue long bite tricky one hand trauma complex try keep peace martha even though seriously escalate behaviour could relate fundamental self hate tie together perhaps become enthral people assault partner report story old man really think go career continue go place hate much let get assault many time go back last ep make friend story stockholm syndrome leave good feel finish series main actor go event none dramatise story hope long term therapy story promote happy view feel show case human behaviour people complex reason way think watch
0	As a sci fi fan, I was looking forward to this. I wished I hadn't bothered.Some of the casting leaves a lot to be desired. Some characters are just not believable, especially Auggie.The current trend of making female characters say the F word for absolutely no reason, is prevalent here and London is the only place in the UK that seems to exist in the movie world, as usual.It really does drag most of the time. I found myself tempted to skip an episode or two to find some excitement.I didn't, worried I would miss some crucial detail, but I wished I had.Some of the visuals were good, but overall way to slow and boring for my taste.Each to their own, I guess.	sci fi fan look forward wish bother cast leave lot desire character believable especially auggie current trend make female character say f word absolutely reason prevalent london place uk seem exist movie world usual really drag time find tempt skip episode two find excitement worry would miss crucial detail wish visual good overall way slow bore taste guess

Or some other teen show.Absoulutely dreadfull.So, 4 stars is all i can give it, thats how little it can take to change a view on a show.All in all, this series is absoulutely worth watching, and im hoping the next seasons will contain episodes with higher quality content.	well show great part get season episode give review series good childish behaviour act grow up show completly unnecessary hav grow up portray themselfs like could episode pll teen show absoulutely dreadfull star give that s little take change view show series absoulutely worth watch I m hop next season contain episode high quality content
1	I usually wait to post an overall review until a show is fully done, but now I am fully done with the show.I originally had it at a 9 then 8 and now 7 and I'm doing this review now before it keeps going down.I have amazing memories of the show, season 1-11 are absolutely amazing, all of it, it had a fantastic balance between medical mysteries and difficulties in the OR, with a good mix of home drama and relationship issues, season 12-14 were decent with some good episodes but 15 up to now which is 18 are just some of the most horrendous seasons of tv.There is no more shocking patients, even the family drama is just plain ridiculous, I get after 18 seasons ( renewed for a 19th) it's hard to come up with ideas, SO STOP, go out with a bang!!!I have watched a handful of s18 and it's useless, the show now focuses on whole topics, forcing certain agendas at you, for example I think S17 Maggie thought her boyfriend was going to be killed by the police because he was pulled over, what a load of rubbish, this was in the height of police protests but my god, yes there are bad people out there but your painting an entire police force as animals, I really didn't like that. Greys was a place you would go to escape reality, now it's even worse.My greys days are behind me unfortunately, I'd recommend s1-11 they are superb but just stop after that.	usually wait post overall review show fully do fully do show originally review keep go amaze memory show season absolutely amaze fantastic balance medical mystery difficultie good mix home drama relationship issue season decent good episode horrendous season tv shock patient even family drama plain ridiculous get season renew th hard come idea stop go bang watch handful useless show focus whole topic force certain agenda example think maggie think boyfriend go kill police pull load rubbish height police protest god yes bad people paint entire police force animal really like grey place would go escape reality even bad grey day behind unfortunately recommend superb stop

I just don't understand And i am definitely not a fan of this show even though all the actors are great.	happen people blood kill depression horror every single tv show happen person sit home watch something dark depress like wow good go recommend show everyone every show lately similar mankind foundation start good ruin everything second season baby reindeer westworld yellowstone people satisfy depression darkness real world need free time understand definitely fan show even though actor great

Is it a ""countdown"" to emphysema, the main character sees?Ironic that smoking probably killed more people in the world than a certain revolution mentioned. With a sponsorship from the weapons industry as well, and you are in for a treat of a karma, dear producers....And the show: Very interesting premise and possibly exiting story, but started to get a light cough and itchy eyes after two episodes.

1	"I love most of the characters on the show, especially the three lead females - Angela, Lucy and Nyla. Sergeant Grey and Jake are also great characters. Nathan Fallon's John character has a very similar sense of humor and charisma as his character on Castle. Luckily, it still works.However, starting with season 3 there's been some issues. Way too much PC punchlines and clear insertion of topics and issues that are completely out of place.Also, since Nolan's character is supposed to be a ""rookie"" - it's odd that he seems to take a leading role in a lot of cases. Not realistic at all. Also, the character of Bailey is completely ridiculous, it bothers me on so many levels. It's like Jenna Dewan wanted to be a ""superwoman"" like character or something. Their relationship is also completely fairytale like. It's annoying. Luckily, the other three relationships on the show are much better and make up for it."	love character show especially three lead females angela lucy nyla sergeant grey jake also great character nathan fallon john character similar sense humor charisma character castle luckily still work however start season issue way much pc punchline clear insertion topic issue completely place also since nolan character suppose rookie odd seem take lead role lot case realistic also character bailey completely ridiculous bother many level like jenna dewan want superwoman like character something relationship also completely fairytale like annoy luckily three relationship show much well make
1	Review Update March 2020 It seems this show has found it's home. It still has a tinge of light but has become a more serious cop show. I like it. There is still a lot of focus on character development. It can't match Blue Bloods but it is going in that direction.Original Review: When I heard The Rookie was coming out staring Nathan Fillion I was interested. I like Fillion and would watch anything he stars in. FireFly was a great series. My wife and I watched all episodes of Castle.The first few episodes were a puzzle to me. Was this a comedy? Was it a straight up cop show? Was it a cop soap opera? It just didn't seem to land anywhere for me. But I find each episode gets better and better lately. We find it is often true that new shows get better after several episodes and that seems to be true here as well.I like the whole cast and the character development is at just the right level. The personal lives of the characters don't overwhelm the story lines, yet they are an important factor.I like my cop shows to be depicting honest officers which this show does. We also watch Chicago P.D. but it often crosses the line with cops doing questionable things. We've considered dropping Chicago P.D. from our watch list for that reason.I just watched episode 16 of The Rookie. I would say since about episode 6 or 8 things have gotten more serious and The Rookie is more of a straight-up cop show which I feel has improved the series. But Fillion adds a lot to the attraction of the show.I will continue to watch and expect things to get even better.	review update march seem show find home still tinge light become serious cop show like still lot focus character development match blue blood go direction original review hear rookie come star nathan fillion interest like fillion would watch anything star firefly great series wife watch episode castle first episode puzzle comedy straight cop show cop soap opera seem land anywhere find episode get well well lately find often true new show get well several episode seem true well like whole cast character development right level personal live character overwhelm story line yet important factor like cop show depict honest officer show also watch chicago p often cross line cop questionable thing consider drop chicago p watch list reason watch episode rookie would say since episode thing get serious rookie straight cop show feel improve series fillion add lot attraction show continue watch expect thing get even well

0	"The acting and writing in this series is baffling.All the younger actors simply can't act. Apart from the Chinese woman (young and older versions), everybody else has no depth whatsoever.The writing is another problem in itself. Who the hell kisses their friends on the forehead to say goodbye? The writing is crazy awful and horrible lines/actions are flying around 90% of the time. They tried to bring drama.. They brought cringe.The ""science"" behind it all is also baffling. A simple distance calculation is made to be the most brilliant thing ever. It's pretty grim how this was dumbed down to an extreme. The ""intelligent"" characters are not impressive or believable.There's no emotion and no science, so really, what's in it? I don't really understand who they made this for. It's not for kids, but it's too ~low IQ~ for adults. Maybe teenagers? The ideas behind it all are great (have just bought the book because of it), but the series was extremely poorly executed.Mediocre at best."	act write series baffle young actor simply act apart chinese woman young old version everybody else depth whatsoever write another problem hell kiss friends forehead say goodbye write crazy awful horrible line action fly around time try bring drama bring cringe science behind also baffle simple distance calculation make brilliant thing ever pretty grim dumbe extreme intelligent character impressive believable emotion science really really understand make kid low iq adult maybe teenager idea behind great buy book series extremely poorly execute mediocre good
0	Shogun is one of my favourite books, a sweeping saga of intrigue, murder, plots within plots, great characterisation. The 1980s series stayed true to all that and more. This 2024 version is like a mouthful of dead sea fruit - green and lush to look at but hollow and lacking in any real substance where it matters.I'm sure why some important key elements of the plot were changed or omitted. What's the point of taking a great story and reducing it to a shadow of what it should be?The romance between Blackthorn and Mariko lacked any depth or passion - it feels more casual, like a one night stand or two.There's little to no coverage of the manipulative evil that was the Catholic church, most of the Jesuits and their machinations were left out of the series completely. We hardly see any of Blackthorn's crew and their degeneration in a land that should have elevated them.Mariko's sacrifice had no impact because there was no build up nor explanation for it until after she was gone. Why was she buried when she was cremated in the book? In the book she states that she is Christian but samurai first. Oh, yeah, let's twist the narrative to suit our 21st century mindsets.As for the change in plot to indicate that Ochiba changed her mind about supporting Ishido, why? She and the heir die which enables Toranaga to become Shogun.What a pile of rubbish. Honestly, this could have been awesome. Instead it's just a rushed version that absolutely annihilates what could have been a masterpiece.	shogun one favourite book sweep saga intrigue murder plot within plot great characterisation series stay true version like mouthful dead sea fruit green lush look hollow lack real substance matter sure important key element plot change omit point take great story reduce shadow romance blackthorn mariko lack depth passion feel casual like one night stand two little coverage manipulative evil catholic church jesuit machination leave series completely hardly see blackthorn crew degeneration land elevate mariko sacrifice impact build explanation go bury cremate book book state christian samurai first oh yeah let twist narrative suit st century mindset change plot indicate ochiba change mind support ishido heir die enable toranaga become shogun pile rubbish honestly could awesome instead rush version absolutely annihilate could masterpiece
2	This show is such a comfort to me, been an inspiration too and I love the first 10 seasons so much!...that said, after the 10th season, the show began getting a little repetitive and now we're at the 16th season and I can't stand to watch it at all now, there are only about three of the original cast members remaining in the show and even their storylines are just...tired, and the other characters just dont have this spark in them that makes their plot interesting enough to watch every week. It's sad to see my favorite show in the whole world reach this stage where I can't even get through an episode with all the irrelevant characters and plots crowding up the show, in all honesty, the show should just come to an end before they ruin the charm of the first few seasons too. I rarely write reviews but I feel so strongly about this show and it really bothers me how they've turned it into a complete disaster, I hope they resolve it and put it to an end soon enough, it's run its track for long enough and they can't keep up anymore clearly.	show comfort inspiration love first season much say th season show begin get little repetitive th season stand watch three original cast member remain show even storyline tire character do not spark make plot interest enough watch every week sad see favorite show whole world reach stage even get episode irrelevant character plot crowd show honesty show come end ruin charm first season rarely write review feel strongly show really bother turn complete disaster hope resolve put end soon enough run track long enough keep anymore clearly
1	It was great until cristina Yang left. I watched a few episodes after she left thinking it's just part of the plot and she will be back soon, so I did a quick google search and found that she left the show for good. I couldn't watch it anymore. It was so bland and lacked the dark humor she provided. 10 stars if cristina stayed.	great cristina yang leave watch episode leave think part plot back soon quick google search find leave show good watch anymore bland lack dark humor provide star cristina stay

I had only heard about the show through some friends and did not know what it was about, i decided to give it a shot. I had expected a generic space dram but boy was i surprised. I think i enjoyed it better because i didnt know anything about the story line before starting the show, i suggest you do the same. If you like Arrival, Contact, Oblivion and media along this line the n this show is definately for you.Kudos to showrunners for not shying away from the brutal and gore scenes that do advance the storyline perfectly and which were the logocal step a military commander would have taken to save the humanity and for the greater good. I wasnt sure if the boat would go all the way through but it did !	spoiler last para bad habit read story plot watch medium take fun surprise hear show friend know decide give shoot expect generic space dram boy surprise think enjoy well do not know anything story line start show suggest like arrival contact oblivion medium along line n show definately kudo showrunner shy away brutal gore scene advance storyline perfectly logocal step military commander would take save humanity great good be not sure boat would go way
0	This use to be one of my favorite shows, but now every scene is a political statement and it has turned into a mid quality soap opera. Acting is terrible, music is terrible, all of the characters we actually cared about are gone or dead. I'm so sad it turned into this, they should have ended the show before Derek died honestly.	use one favorite show every scene political statement turn mid quality soap opera act terrible music terrible character actually care go dead sad turn end show derek die honestly
2	Steven Zaillian's episodic 'Ripley' is not for everyone. It is slow. The lack of action, the dialogue's empty spaces .... this particularly the case in the series' first two episodes. Certainly two hours is not required to introduce the story's setup; a seemingly corrupt young man is sent to Europe in order to persuade another - wealthy - young man to return to The States.But with Episode #3 the story takes a dramatic, homicidal, turn. And from that turn it matters little that the pace remains slower than ideal. The stakes, in each ensuing episode, are raised and raised again. The viewer comes to care about the characters (be they villain or victim) and so we wait (patiently if possible) to learn the fate of them in each episode. As situations grow more complex, more perilous, our imaginations take over (at least mine did), and start to create our own story; 'This is what I think is gonna happen / This is who's gonna die'.The cinematography (black and white) is stirring; a perfect match for the piece's dark and foreboding mood. Where Minghella's cinematic version of this story (Jude Law and Matt Damon) was set in a brilliantly colored Venice, Zaillian's version show's us Italy's underside, darker side; a choice so perfect as to astonish. In both Episodes #3 and #5 the camera brings us nose to nose with the action; again a wise choice. The film does not shirk from its desire to leave us gasping for air.Andrew Scott as Tom Ripley is perfectly quirky, nerdy, unlikeable, and snake-like. A brilliant choice. Quite the opposite of Matt Damon's charmer, this Ripley is a student of the never-back-down; no matter how close he is to the edge of failure, his brain erects a path forward.Dakota Fanning as Marge Sherwood, the young woman in distress is, I guess, OK. In fact I didn't like the character, her innocent young writer abroad. There was a too-willingness to 'buy' explanations that made me doubt her intelligence or motives. A sense of superiority, late in the film, that I liked even less. How much of this is a result of her performance rather than script / direction, I cannot say.But worthy of note are Elliot Sumner as Freddie Miles, a sensuous if over-the-top nemissis of Tom Ripley's. Then Maurizio Lombardi as Rome Italy's Inspector Ravini; as funny and fascinating a portrayal of a policeman as you will ever see; particularly his insistence of pronouncing 'Freddie Miles' as 'Freddie MeeLess'. Bokeem Woodbine's appearance in Episodes #1 and #8 adds a frame to the story. His Private Detective is as pitch-perfect a portrayal of a tough but not-as-smart-as-he-seems New Yorker as you can find.Again, Ripley is not everyone's cup o'tea. And if you give up on it, it's not as though it's the greatest loss you'll ever suffer.But nevertheless, a loss it definitely is.	steven zaillian episodic ripley everyone slow lack action dialogue empty space particularly case series first two episode certainly two hour require introduce story setup seemingly corrupt young man send europe order persuade another wealthy young man return state episode story take dramatic homicidal turn turn matter little pace remain slow ideal stake ensue episode raise raise viewer come care character villain victim wait patiently possible learn fate episode situation grow complex perilous imagination take least mine start create story think go to happen go to die cinematography black white stir perfect match piece dark forebode mood minghella cinematic version story jude law matt damon set brilliantly color venice zaillian version show us italy underside darker side choice perfect astonish episode camera bring we nose nose action wise choice film shirk desire leave we gasp air andrew scott tom ripley perfectly quirky nerdy unlikeable snake like brilliant choice quite opposite matt damon charmer ripley student never back matter close edge failure brain erect path forward dakota fan marge sherwood young woman distress guess ok fact like character innocent young writer abroad willingness buy explanation make doubt intelligence motive sense superiority late film like even less much result performance rather script direction say worthy note elliot sumner freddie mile sensuous top nemissis tom ripley maurizio lombardi rome italy inspector ravini funny fascinate portrayal policeman ever see particularly insistence pronounce freddie miles freddie meeless bokeem woodbine appearance episode add frame story private detective pitch perfect portrayal tough smart seem new yorker find ripley everyone cup tea give though great loss ever suffer nevertheless loss definitely
0	I didn't come from reading the novel, and went in blank. And what an absolute garbage this was. It seemed liked the writers bit off more than they can chew. The plot was riddled with loopholes and the story itself wasn't aware what it wanted to portray. The major thing that stuck out to me was that if the aliens were so advanced and had sent two quantum computers to monitor the humans, then why can't they just have taken control of the world leaders instead of supporting the stupid cult. And whose idea was to put in sending 300 atomic bombs in space, are you kidding me?. I just don't understand who approved this screenplay from Netflix. If you are a science fiction fan stay away from this show at all costs. This is beyond pathetic.	come read novel go blank absolute garbage seem like writer bite chew plot riddle loophole story aware want portray major thing stick alien advance send two quantum computer monitor human take control world leader instead support stupid cult whose idea put send atomic bomb space kid understand approve screenplay netflix science fiction fan stay away show cost beyond pathetic
1	Honestly I'm looking forward to the second season. But the first season didn't turn out the way I'd hoped. The first episodes were beautiful and exciting. The dark futuristic atmosphere was good. However, towards the end, that atmosphere gave way to an ordinary sci-fi series. In an eight-episode series, we expect the action to pick up towards the sixth episode and peak at seven and eight, but this is not the case at all in this series. The first few episodes are great, but after the fourth episode, the script drops off. Also, I don't understand the unnecessary mystery created in some chapters. (Btw aren't we tired of seeing Jonathan Pryce when it comes to religion or cults?)	honestly look forward second season first season turn way hop first episode beautiful excite dark futuristic atmosphere good however towards end atmosphere give way ordinary sci fi series eight episode series expect action pick towards sixth episode peak seven eight case series first episode great fourth episode script drop also understand unnecessary mystery create chapter btw tire see jonathan pryce come religion cult

0	So far, there is no any adaptation exceed the book. The parts of Luoji'class, put the the Quantum to deep space and many other adaptation in animation exceed the book. The part of LuoJi throw tools and tools divide to multiple is so interesting.The reason why it is said to be a long trailer is the same as I thought before, which is caused by pulling the preparation stories of the last two books forward, so that the audience can only watch the head.Each episode is multi-line, such as the eighth episode with walls and stairs. This is different from what was expected at first. I think the single line is clearer.The part of looking at the bug. It's not very burning. The first half of Tencent's version dragged on, drinking crazy, and the second half became more and more burning, and the score was very good.The opening song is very short. I criticized Tencent's opening song for imitating the West before, but I didn't expect Netflix's own song to be unconventional now.The cruelty of the guzheng plan is well reflected. Tencent version is somewhat weak. In this scene, the people on the boat are fleeing, making the protagonists look like villains. I like this kind of values very much.Ye Wenjie, a staunch believer, was counterespionated by Wade with the recording of Evans and the Lord? The taste of 2DB is too low. They adapted it to a worse version. It must be better that Ye Wenjie, who loves human beings spontaneously. This will more complex and three-dimensional. Of course, Ye Wenjie actually changed because of Qijiatun. But it's better than this.The part of you're bugs is okay. Tencent version is more confusing.2DB is really incompetent. Ye Wenjie and Cheng Jin said this? The same counterespionage as Wade? Ye Wenjie has become a big fool! She even need be teached by Cheng jin, a younger generation? Ye Wenjie's position should run through all three books, and she is a great mentor and wise woman. Hmm. This is not as good as the animation. The part of Ye Wenjie was put on trial in the animation, although she played a villain, at least showed wisdom. Ye Wenjie's plot compiled by 2DB actually seems pedantic.Three factions were reduced to one arrival faction. 2DB brain capacity are really small, so they can't understand original ideal of Ye and the ideal of three factions.Ye's smile was so enchanting and evil when she shows up. What a villain.The part of let's not resist quite elegant. But this is because of faith in the Lord. . Kind of like a dynamic cartoon version. However, the characterization of ye Wenjie in dynamic cartoon version also takes a variety of routes, and only Pan Han is the bad guy.Why does 2DB think its adaptation will be better than the original plot? So far, many adaptations are inferior to the original.Why let Yang take the credit? 2DB can't tolerate there are any good people in China? This is the plot of copying Bai Betrayal Ye in an inferior way.Think of it, if there is no original comparison, the impression of the pure villain Ye is still ok. Unfortunately, there is comparison, 2DB still went to a bad way.When I watch the last episode of 7. Finally, it's time for cosmosociology. As a result, the dialogues are very strange. Is it a new clue to defeat the three-body different from book2? Watch season2. In a word, this part is quite satisfactory, the artistic conception of an old and a young talking about wisdom has been made out. But at first Ye said, I know you don't want to see me. Hey, what characterization? This is. Big villain ye.Will did a good job of following Saul's advice according to the numbers. In the book is filled with inner descriptions.In addition, Ye talks wisdom with saul was not arranged in the first episode or the last episode, which was not very good and was not grand enough. Of course, this characterization of Ye Wenjie itself is not grand. Maybe some reporters wrote a film review saying that the character is flat refers to Ye.It's really great to visit Red Coast Base again without deleting it by 2DB. Actually, Ye of this kind characterization doesn't have to visit Red Coast Base again. And It's also best to visit Red Coast Base again in the last episode.Ye Wenjie was silenced? 2DB can't give an ending of die a natural death. Hey. The scene where the woman talks to Ye looks disgusting. Trying to kill me and pretending.I originally said that Tencent version has shortcomings, I hope this version can surpass it. Who knows it's not as good as that. It is said that 2DB can't adapt well without original books. I don't think it will good if there is. Why not follow the book and change it into a plot with poor effect? It is a good thing to speed up the story. But I didn't ask you to change the plot, and it got worse.Moreover, we already know the plot of the story, so it's no fun to watch the same story again. The animation adds a main line, the four episodes of the Sky-ladder, except for the love drama, the science fiction part is quite good.I watched it at twice the speed. Except for all the Ye parts. But Ye parts disappoint me. YeWenJie is soul role of S1, but 2DB adapts badly. Destroy the original classic characters, 2DB must apologize to the people of the whole world.	far adaptation exceed book part luoji class put quantum deep space many adaptation animation exceed book part luoji throw tool tool divide multiple interest reason say long trailer think cause pull preparation story last two book forward audience watch head episode multi line eighth episode wall stairs different expect first think single line clear part look bug burn first half tencent version drag drink crazy second half become burn score good open song short criticize tencent open song imitate west expect netflix song unconventional cruelty guzheng plan well reflect tencent version somewhat weak scene people boat flee make protagonist look like villain like kind value much ye wenjie staunch believer counterespionate wade record evans lord taste db low adapt bad version must better ye wenjie love human be spontaneously complex three dimensional course ye wenjie actually change qijiatun well part bug okay tencent version confuse db really incompetent ye wenjie cheng jin say counterespionage wade ye wenjie become big fool even need teach cheng jin young generation ye wenjie position run three book great mentor wise woman hmm good animation part ye wenjie put trial animation although play villain least show wisdom ye wenjie plot compile db actually seem pedantic three faction reduce one arrival faction db brain capacity really small understand original ideal ye ideal three faction ye smile enchant evil show villain part let resist quite elegant faith lord kind like dynamic cartoon version however characterization ye wenjie dynamic cartoon version also take variety rout pan han bad guy db think adaptation well original plot far many adaptation inferior original let yang take credit db tolerate good people china plot copy bai betrayal ye inferior way think original comparison impression pure villain ye still ok unfortunately comparison db still go bad way watch last episode finally time cosmosociology result dialogue strange new clue defeat three body different book watch season word part quite satisfactory artistic conception old young talk wisdom make first ye say know want see hey characterization big villain ye good job follow saul advice accord number book fill inner description addition ye talk wisdom saul arrange first episode last episode good grand enough course characterization ye wenjie grand maybe reporter write film review say character flat refer ye really great visit red coast base without delete db actually ye kind characterization visit red coast base also good visit red coast base last episode ye wenjie silence db give end die natural death hey scene woman talk ye look disgust try kill pretend originally say tencent version shortcoming hope version surpass know good say db adapt well without original book think good follow book change plot poor effect good thing speed story ask change plot get bad moreover already know plot story fun watch story animation add main line four episode sky ladder except love drama science fiction part quite good watch twice speed except ye part ye part disappoint yewenjie soul role db adapt badly destroy original classic character db must apologize people whole world
1	The first four seasons are fantastic a 10/10 but as the show runners stopped adapting the source material and then eventually ran out of it all went downhill. Every season they manage to have better hair, costumes, music and CGI but that is not why people watch.

New season has continuous Rosiland Dyer storyline-this is especially bloody, violent & ridiculous.Storyline is to grab high marks for the Rookie Feds new show so producers are dragging this line out too long (crossover episode).I have stopped watching Rookie for this reason until the Rosiland character disappears from the storyline. This program used to be good without the extra violence- I like Rookie Feds so far. Maybe this new show will be more interesting. The crossover episode is on Oct 18- I will look at the episode & will shut it off if the Rosiland character isn't killed off permanently.	watch hulu leave review new season continuous rosiland dyer storyline especially bloody violent ridiculous storyline grab high mark rookie feds new show producer drag line long crossover episode stop watch rookie reason rosiland character disappear storyline program use good without extra violence like rookie feds far maybe new show interest crossover episode oct look episode shut rosiland character kill permanently
2	I really enjoy Grey's Anatomy still. I first watched it when I had to pull an all-nighter for school. I bought season one because it was on sale and I just wanted something on in the background. I got completely sucked in and bought season two when it came out. I started watching it on TV at the beginning of season three. For awhile I thought things were going a little downhill. The show lost some steam during the writers' strike, but there were some decent plots in season five. Season six started out strong, kind of mellowed, then ended with the best finale of the lot. I didn't like the first episode of season seven, but every subsequent episode has been better and better. I have fallen in love with the characters, and I still love them. There are a few to many life-threatening disasters directly involving main characters, but it is a TV show. Overall, I would definitely recommend it.	really enjoy grey anatomy still first watch pull night school buy season one sale want something background get completely suck buy season two come start watch tv begin season three awhile think thing go little downhill show lose steam writer strike decent plot season five season six start strong kind mellow end good finale lot like first episode season seven every subsequent episode well well fall love character still love many life threaten disaster directly involve main character tv show overall would definitely recommend

Interesting concept and definitely an interesting read, but not the type of sci-fi novel that I indulge - too much plot devices and not abstract enough to feel the otherworldliness. I compared it to da vinci's code, so I would consider that a compliment.The show's weakness has been well documented. Extremely shallow modern cast and senseless personal stories that feel like I am watching sex and the city (no offense). The story of the young yeh wenji started strong but I have no way believing she grew into the adult yeh wenji who has zero persuasiveness as a cult leader and one of the most influential scientific figure.I think the short of it is I detest Netflix and pretty much all of their shows (unfortunately my brother in law works there so I can't avoid the exposure). Netflix was once decent and was a haven for good filmmakers to prosper. It has diminished itself to AI generated mindlessness.The story of our era.	read book first come interest concept definitely interest read type sci fi novel indulge much plot device abstract enough feel otherworldliness compare da vinci code would consider compliment show weakness well document extremely shallow modern cast senseless personal story feel like watch sex city offense story young yeh wenji start strong way believe grow adult yeh wenji zero persuasiveness cult leader one influential scientific figure think short detest netflix pretty much show unfortunately brother law work avoid exposure netflix decent good filmmaker prosper diminish ai generate mindlessness story era
1	I've never read the books, so rest assured I don't view 3BP as some sort of sacred cow, never to be touched unless to achieve pure perfection. However this series does struggle.My biggest gripe, is the trailers present this show to us as a dazzling, big-budget, mind-bending sci-fi epic. However 95% of the scenes look and feel like they're straight out of a low-quality BBC drama. It's drudging at times, and you do start to feel like you're never going to get the pay-off you deserve at the end.And after 8 episodes, that's pretty much what happens. I'm aware that the original story is complex and will take time to come fruition on screen, which is fine, but you need something along the way to keep you with it. It's sorely lacking in this regard.A cruel yet reasonably accurate summary, would be a group of friends gassing about how clever they are for 8 episodes, interspersed with a few scenes of psychedelic space-guff that never seems to progress anywhere quickly.I've been harsh here, but the premise is intriguing enough for me to watch a second season if it ever comes to pass. However, knowing how ruthless Netflix are in this regard, and how poorly the show has performed on the platform so far, I won't hold my breath for it.	never read book rest assure view bp sort sacred cow never touch unless achieve pure perfection however series struggle big gripe trailer present show we dazzle big budget mind bend sci fi epic however scene look feel like straight low quality bbc drama drudge time start feel like never go get pay deserve end episode pretty much happen aware original story complex take time come fruition screen fine need something along way keep sorely lack regard cruel yet reasonably accurate summary would group friend gas clever episode intersperse scene psychedelic space guff never seem progress anywhere quickly harsh premise intrigue enough watch second season ever come pass however know ruthless netflix regard poorly show perform platform far hold breath
0	I haven't read the book or watched the other versions of the 3 Body Problem. As a new watcher to the story, this show was annoying and strange. I couldn't connect with the characters as they developed.So many good reviews of this show makes me believe I must be taking crazy pills because this is not leaving a good impression to me at all.The special effects are good, the acting is ok, but there is an arrogance to this show that gives it an ora that it's better than it really is.The biggest issue is that it is very unclear what everyone's motivation is. Why are they so invested in what they are doing? What are they afraid of? Are they just all bored??? As a new viewer to the whole story, this is all so unclear and was not enjoyable to follow.	read book watch version body problem new watcher story show annoy strange connect character develop many good review show make believe must take crazy pill leave good impression special effect good act ok arrogance show give ora well really big issue unclear everyone motivation invest afraid bore new viewer whole story unclear enjoyable follow
1	It started as a really good show with some very good stories but it's turned into a number neurotic women characters that made them look weak, confused and without values and morals. I did see Meredith finally come to her own but it took a long time but the rest of women represent so much flighty decisions, confusion on who they are and what they care about. I hope that the younger generation don't see these characters as good role models. I liked the stances on some of the social issues and how they applied real humanity empathy but some of went too far and as the seasons went on it was clear it was written by some extreme left wing writers. It's too bad....	start really good show good story turn number neurotic woman character make look weak confuse without value moral see meredith finally come take long time rest woman represent much flighty decision confusion care hope young generation see character good role model like stance social issue apply real humanity empathy go far season go clear write extreme leave wing writer bad
1	I haven't read the book, so I'm reviewing this series from a more objective point of view.Production quality is great, special effects are OK.However, acting is mediocre at best and cringe-worthy most of the time. And where did you get that Latino chic who looks like she just got off the Versace's ramp? Silicone lips, fake eye-lashes... and you're telling us she is some kind of Oxford genius? Oh, come on... Have you ever been to Oxford/Cambridge, have you actually seen what kind of people are best scientists, what they look like, how they behave, what they do in free time? I thought so... The Chinese Cultural Revolution part is great: the setting, the story are very touching and the Asian actors are first-class. Ye's story is really interesting. However, the London drama is so boring and the actors can't act a bit... You actually have to pull through 3-4 episodes for the story to take off.There are 3 books, so I guess there will be at least 2 more seasons... please hire better actors and don't ruin it further.	read book review series objective point view production quality great special effect ok however act mediocre good cringe worthy time get latino chic look like get versace ramp silicone lip fake eye lash tell we kind oxford genius oh come ever oxford cambridge actually see kind people good scientist look like behave free time think chinese cultural revolution part great set story touch asian actor first class ye story really interest however london drama bore actor act bite actually pull episode story take book guess least season please hire well actor ruin
0	Let's just get right to the point, it's a beautifully crafted pile of poop. That's the biggest compliment I can give him.As someone who has read the original many times, this version of the play adaptation is simply disastrous and inexcusable.If the writers don't have a clear sense of their own abilities, please don't try to change the original setting of an arguably great work of sci-fi; your best bet when you don't have that ability to do it better is to stay true to the original.As of now, I've barely made it through the first 4 episodes with a huge amount of discomfort, and that's as far as I can stand it. The jumpy but boring narrative technique, the poor acting, the thin and feeble characterization, and the transformation of all the most exquisite story settings from the original writings into a bad romance drama is simply an insult to the viewers' intelligence.	let get right point beautifully craft pile poop big compliment give someone read original many time version play adaptation simply disastrous inexcusable writer clear sense ability please try change original set arguably great work sci fi well bet ability well stay true original barely make first episode huge amount discomfort far stand jumpy bore narrative technique poor act thin feeble characterization transformation exquisite story setting original write bad romance drama simply insult viewer intelligence

0	The new challenge, how to screw up a TV shows final reached a new level! :((	new challenge screw tv show final reach new level
2	Yup. You read the title right. The fact that this show is so detached to 3BP is the exact reason why it's a show worth watching.I really do not understand why Three Body Problem was such a great book. It suffered from severe pacing issues and devoted far too much time to irrelevant details. It also suffered from severe plot holes and setting issues, such as how one of the characters broadcasted a radio signal in a way so simple that others should have thought of it beforehand. In addition, the book brought up VR but never explained its significance to the common people (Is RP1 happening worldwide? Who knows?). The book does this with millions of other concepts and fails to elaborate on any of them. There was just too many ideas - too much fat.Why did I rant so much about the book? Because surprisingly, a Netflix adaptation with the traditional Netflix elements solved every one of the issues above. It really tightened the pacing and grappled with the core issues of the book only - nothing else. It preserved what was important and discarded what wasn't. Sometimes, I feel like the netflix/hollywood hate can get over the top, blinding people of truly enjoyable shows.In conclusion, this show improves everything there was on the book and I would recommend this over the trilogy any day. Please ignore the other haters, they're just blinded by the mindless mob hate I mentioned previously. Just go watch it and let it wow you.P. S. For an actual good Sci-fi read I would suggest the Ender Quartet (especially the first two books) as well as Dune.	yup read title right fact show detach bp exact reason show worth watch really understand three body problem great book suffer severe pace issue devote far much time irrelevant detail also suffer severe plot hole set issue one character broadcast radio signal way simple other think beforehand addition book bring vr never explain significance common people rp happen worldwide know book million concept fail elaborate many idea much fat rant much book surprisingly netflix adaptation traditional netflix element solve every one issue really tighten pace grapple core issue book nothing else preserve important discard sometimes feel like netflix hollywood hate get top blind people truly enjoyable show conclusion show improve everything book would recommend trilogy day please ignore hater blind mindless mob hate mention previously go watch let wow p actual good sci fi read would suggest ender quartet especially first two book well dune
2	"I am not a video game person. I have no prior knowledge of the video games this is based on. I watched this because I heard there was a similarity between this and The Last id US, which I loved. There is some similiarity in that there is a grim, post-apocalyptic setting and a ""quest"", but it has a very different tone. I love the 1950's ""frozen in time"" infused nature of this one. Walter Goggins is always good and this is no exception. The series is littered with commentary about the attempts to live in a Utopian society, and the failings of mankind. It is part sci-fi, part western, part drama and more. It is interesting, visually terrific. Well scripted. It is well Directed. It is very, very watchable. The acting is great. There are many cameos and famous stars throughout. I liked this a lot.

2	I've just watched on of the most disturbing, thought provoking, sad, funny and brilliant piece of TV drama I have seen in years. However the major thing that's blown my mind is that it's based on a true story.When I started it, I thought it was going to be light hearted afternoon viewing, the first episode is only 30 minutes, and didn't seem too deep.Then it takes a very dark turn covering themes and topics (no spoilers) in such a powerful no punches pulled way it had me crying.The character are honest and the writing kept my glued until I watched every episodes in on go.

0	To make a review short, the first three episodes are 90% science fiction. They are pretty interesting and exciting.After the third episode, the series becomes a soap opera, stretched, primarily dull, not logical, mostly about people's relationships and emotions.By the way, the casting and acting of the actors is terrible.I believed in only Jin Cheng and Thomas Wade acting.I don't want to judge Netflix, but I really don't remember when I have seen some good file/serial on Netflix, for at least 2-3 years. I hope they will not continue to make new episodes based on this original book. At least not in such quality.	make review short first three episode science fiction pretty interest excite third episode series become soap opera stretch primarily dull logical mostly people relationship emotion way cast act actor terrible believe jin cheng thomas wade act want judge netflix really remember see good file serial netflix least year hope continue make new episode base original book least quality
2	Loved absolutely loved the first 3 seasons. Ever since officer Juarez joined the cast I have been turned off from the show. How does she make so many mistakes and so emotional and is still on the LAPD Nolan after making a single mistake almost got booted. Juarez and her emotions are just too much. This character is why I will no longer be watching the show. Just watching her is aggravating. With all those instabilities, mental issues, and feelings she shouldn't be a cop. So season 4/5 1 star. The show needs to show more of Aaron Thorsen he started off being around in the show and came with a mysterious background and an interesting family. We don't get to see much of his character development or much of him at all which is frankly disappointing. The show set us up and got us into a character just to stop showing him. In my personal opinion I would like to see more of him and less Juarez.	love absolutely love first season ever since officer juarez join cast turn show make many mistake emotional still lapd nolan make single mistake almost get boot juarez emotion much character long watch show watch aggravate instability mental issue feel cop season star show need show aaron thorsen start around show come mysterious background interest family get see much character development much frankly disappoint show set we get we character stop show personal opinion would like see less juarez

1	"Being a fan of the FPS games I was optimistic about the show when I read the game creator was involved. It doesn't disappoint in that regard. It captures the spirit of Fallout quite well, in every aspect. The visuals, the props, the music, the humor, and specially the violence. It really feels like you're watching cutscenes of a new Fallout game. Where it disappoints is on the actual story. The characters are interesting, but the general plot and the arc of each one are completely predictable. What kept my interest were the creative ""show, don't tell"" moments and the funny surprises that happened here and there, rather than the resolution of the plot which I could predict from a mile away. It's not great, but it's a good show and I'm looking forward to season 2."	fan fps game optimistic show read game creator involve disappoint regard capture spirit fallout quite well every aspect visual prop music humor specially violence really feel like watch cutscene new fallout game disappoint actual story character interest general plot arc one completely predictable keep interest creative show tell moment funny surprise happen rather resolution plot could predict mile away great good show look forward season
2	The viewers greatly appreciate that the show's agenda is to show realistically that most cops are good but there is a minority of bad cops - a stark contrast to what politically motivated media would have you believe.Additionally, the exit of actors attempting to make political statements by leaving the show - good riddance and thank you for cleaning up the cast list with your exit.	viewer greatly appreciate show agenda show realistically cop good minority bad cop stark contrast politically motivate medium would believe additionally exit actor attempt make political statement leave show good riddance thank clean cast list exit
0	The themes are basically the same as in the book, but I think they made very poor desitions and writing with the characters.They act like children, and are very annoying in general. The only thing keeping you watching is the overall mystery. Not their teen-like issues and concversations.It also feels a little too long. They could have wrapped the novel in 6 episodes and it would have been fine.It feel like they don't respect the audience enough to think that we can handle a mature sci fi series.They basically took an amazing novel, merged it with scooby-doo and called it a day.Sorry for my spelling.

0	The show started off really well very violent good simple story line. The effects where really good all the sets look well thought of. But then after episode 4 everything changes. If your love the game and you expect to see your favourite creatures you love facing in the game in here, well sadly you'll be disappointed. Despite the game being apocalyptic the world never feels empty, there's always danger around every corner. Here in the show our protagonist's are able to walk around the wasteland freely without barely any danger. That's right folks no super mutants, no mirelocks, no mole miners, no deathclaws, barely any ghouls. The shows just literally feels like it ran out of budget midway through. How can you have a fallout show without these creatures? There's no fan service here, as I watching I was like ok we gonna see some super mutants soon? Umm nope never came. What about the walking robots? Umm nope none of that here either. Well screw you johnathan Nolan who claims to love the games well clearly not.	show start really well violent good simple story line effect really good set look well think episode everything change love game expect see favourite creature love face game well sadly disappoint despite game apocalyptic world never feel empty always danger around every corner show protagonist able walk around wasteland freely without barely danger right folk super mutant mirelock mole miner deathclaw barely ghoul show literally feel like run budget midway fallout show without creature fan service watch like ok go to see super mutant soon umm nope never come walk robot umm nope none either well screw johnathan nolan claim love game well clearly
2	I thought the excellent The Last Of Us was the best onscreen video-game adaptation so far. And it was. Until now. Fallout is similarly well realised with great attention to detail, very well acted by a great cast and a budget to do it justice. Where I give it a slight edge over TLOU is purely down to it being an original story, albeit set within the Fallout world. While TLOU was a brilliantly faithful retelling of the game's story, this had much more tension for viewers not knowing where it was going. I assume this will be renewed for more seasons as this is top quality! A tip of the hat to all involved!	think excellent last we good onscreen video game adaptation far fallout similarly well realise great attention detail well act great cast budget justice give slight edge tlou purely original story albeit set within fallout world tlou brilliantly faithful retell game story much tension viewer know go assume renew season top quality tip hat involve
0	There's not much to say about this show other than that the 9/10 review can only be seen as a joke.There are a couple of great episodes, the first two in fact. The show just collapses after that. Nothing really happens. There is no plot. No character development. The dialogues don't lead anywhere or have any purpose. Shogun isn't good as a character drama, or a pseudo-historical epic or even a soap opera.Even from a visual perspective it's dull and grey, and the camera has a weird blur and depth of field that's overdone.When all's said and done this show is just extremely unmemorable and badly made.	much say show review see joke couple great episode first two fact show collapse nothing really happen plot character development dialogue lead anywhere purpose shogun good character drama pseudo historical epic even soap opera even visual perspective dull grey camera weird blur depth field overdo say do show extremely unmemorable badly make

I just finished watching.The first thing to say is that I hate this show because I know it's based on something good.The are genuinely good ideas here which is what kept me watching to the end of the series, but when it finished I was angry with myself for watching it. Those good parts I mention, I can tell are lifted from something good (I've not done enough research to tell what that is yet although I'm aware there is another version) but the characters involved are all that unlikeable you don't care anyway!You can tell this series is teeing up something much bigger for the next, but I for one won't be watching.	go sound like rant fresh finish watch first thing say hate show know base something good genuinely good idea keep watch end series finish angry watch good part mention tell lift something good do enough research tell yet although aware another version character involve unlikeable care anyway tell series tee something much big next one watch
1	This show was so gooooood! First and second season were really so good and real. Something bad happened in the third season and it's almost unwatchable. The story line is important and there is a lot of improvement on clearing black life's matter but it's brought to the front in such a lame way, I feel like I'm watching the public channel. Everything is so expected and there is like no effort to create any interesting backgrounds or a plot. Plus Nolan is becoming so annoying in his politically correct almost fake behavior, it just doesn't really work.This season, if doesn't change soon ( already on episode 6 ) will finish this show. 2 bad.Edit: Gave a shot to season 4 - this has become a bad joke. They might as well just shut down. 2 painful to watch.	show gooooood first second season really good real something bad happen third season almost unwatchable story line important lot improvement clear black life matter bring front lame way feel like watch public channel everything expect like effort create interest background plot plus nolan become annoy politically correct almost fake behavior really work season change soon already episode finish show bad edit give shoot season become bad joke might well shut painful watch
1	I would give the show 8 or 9 stars, but after binging 12 seasons I must ask myself the above question. Many themes are presented which affect less than a few percent of he population, but those of us with misophonia (15 to 20%) are constantly being bombarded with characters eating chips and apples or eating with their mouth full. C'mon, Hollywood and Shonda Rhimes, Betsy Beers and Mark Gordon. This really bites (pun intended).	would give show star binge season must ask question many theme present affect less percent population us misophonia constantly bombard character eat chip apple eat mouth full c mon hollywood shonda rhime betsy beers mark gordon really bite pun intend
1	Yeah I read the books, and don't care that they altered the story. It's just too dumbed down and characters are trash.Western audiences think of themselves as sofiticated. True, in most cases Hollywood mainstream stylistic and writing do feel superior to everything else out there qualitatively. Here however marketing strategy for mainstream audiences is taking priority over the story.First of all the show could have been waay more Chinease. And that would be FINE. We don't really engage much with that part of the world especially when it comes to movies. It's a Chinease book anyway so why not. The historic and political context is difficult to monouver about and, that's what makes it interesting. With a proper western cinematic style this could have become something admired BOTH in China and in the West. A wasted opportunity.Casting is weak and characters are trash. An instagram model Auggie (aka nerdy scientist) and her friends struggle with morality of difficult choices in the face of an alien invasion. They don't really give any credible position on the subject, all it takes is to remind them (every time) that aliens are coming so...¯\_('')_/¯ I guess the trolley dillema loses a bit of steam if you introduce the existance of the whole humanity forever on one side.Story is dumbed down. In the book we got fluctuations of Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation measured on a scientific aparature. Here we get blinking stars. They think audience is too dumb to get excited about real science. I guess the CMB, for which discovery 2 american scientists recieved Nobel Prize as recently as 2006, is just too boring for the dum-dums. Sarcasm aside, I don't believe so and that's my point. This should have been Oppenheimer level science storytelling and its not even Bill Nye .The Staircase project is about detonating atomic bomb just behind the sail in vicinity of the probe and attachment cables. Nice.Auggie is coming up with brilliant production-ready applications of the recently discovered nano-fibers but we barely see her solving science problems. She drinks a lot tho, not for a second ceasing to look hot af btw.There is this one time ETO tries to recruit couple of friends and then kill the one who refuses. They still expect other friend to be generally cool with it because it's the Lords plan lol.There is whole plot about dying dude who couldn't move on from the girl he secretly loves. Skip this one is just boring.Good things: Da Shi just as good as in the book.Retrospection scenes with Ye Wendje.Sophon, visualisation of it's deployment.The human computer scene (in the game).Panama Channel scene is fine.	yeah read book care alter story dumbe character trash western audience think sofiticate true case hollywood mainstream stylistic write feel superior everything else qualitatively however market strategy mainstream audience take priority story first show could waay chinease would fine really engage much part world especially come movie chinease book anyway historic political context difficult monouver make interest proper western cinematic style could become something admire china west waste opportunity cast weak character trash instagram model auggie aka nerdy scientist friend struggle morality difficult choice face alien invasion really give credible position subject take remind every time alien come guess trolley dillema lose bite steam introduce existance whole humanity forever one side story dumbe book get fluctuation cosmic microwave background radiation measure scientific aparature get blink star think audience dumb get excite real science guess cmb discovery american scientist recieve nobel prize recently bear dum dums sarcasm aside believe point oppenheimer level science storytelle even bill nye staircase project detonate atomic bomb behind sail vicinity probe attachment cable nice auggie come brilliant production ready application recently discover nano fiber barely see solve science problem drink lot tho second cease look hot af btw one time eto try recruit couple friend kill one refuse still expect friend generally cool lord plan lol whole plot die dude move girl secretly love skip one bore good thing da shi good book retrospection scene ye wendje sophon visualisation deployment human computer scene game panama channel scene fine
1	Up until Season-7, I've been really really enjoying the show. The stories were interesting and so were the medical cases. I learnt quite a few medical terms because of this show and that was a big added advantage. But, Season-8 onwards, really felt that the show went more inclined towards the characters' stories and less towards the medical cases and the thing that really put me off was the pace at which they were killing and making important characters exit from the show. After that, I left it in between. It feels that they should stop stretching it like a stretchy-band and end the show before more people downgrade the show's rating.	season really really enjoy show story interest medical case learn quite medical term show big add advantage season onwards really feel show go incline towards character story less towards medical case thing really put pace kill make important character exit show leave feel stop stretch like stretchy band end show people downgrade show rat
0	"This was a pretty good show initially. As many other reviewers said, seasons 1 and 2 were very good. There was a lot of story and depth with the characters....even characters you didn't really care for, you understood and saw value. The premise of the show was clear and unmolested. The cast was diverse and true to the geographical location the show is portrayed in (LA). There was a lot of ""ahhhh, now I get it"" moments with the characters. It was truly a joy to partake in.There were annoying gripes I typically have of these types of shows, but they were not as egregious as other shows. Magic guns that never run out of ammo, impossible conflicts where the hero wins, etc...those aren't quite as bad as with other shows. However, one gripe of mine is the bias shown for or against certain issues. For sake of not revealing spoilers, there is one episode where something which is perfectly legal was insinuated as not being legal...as there was a claim made someone was transporting something to the police. This kind of false statement shows a bias that ought not exist in this type of writing.Which leads me to season 3. We made it about halfway through it before we just stopped. It's nauseating. This particular trend in shows/movies needs to end. Every episode in the season was some kind of finger wag towards the main character because of his skin color and/or gender. Or, some kind of insinuation or outright claim about some kind of 'ism. It's a show about a middle aged construction worker who decides to become a cop in LA and is a trouble magnet, but has a knack for connecting with people and doing real police work. Don't get me wrong, there is a place for this type of issue...and it was handled pretty good in the earlier seasons when it came up....but this is just too far.Unfortunately we can't go back in time and fix season 3. I don't know if we will give the show another chance. It's a shame too because we really like the cast, characters, and the writing from seasons 1 and 2."	pretty good show initially many reviewer say season good lot story depth character even character really care understand see value premise show clear unmolested cast diverse true geographical location show portray la lot ahhhh get moment character truly joy partake annoy grip typically type show egregious show magic gun never run ammo impossible conflict hero win etc quite bad show however one gripe mine bias show certain issue sake reveal spoiler one episode something perfectly legal insinuate legal claim make someone transport something police kind false statement show bias ought exist type write lead season make halfway stop nauseate particular trend show movie need end every episode season kind finger wag towards main character skin color gender kind insinuation outright claim kind ism show middle age construction worker decide become cop la trouble magnet knack connect people real police work get wrong place type issue handle pretty good early season come far unfortunately go back time fix season know give show another chance shame really like cast character write season
1	So I've watched the first two episodes and it's pretty good. Lots of interesting stuff is happening and the story is building nicely.There is decent acting, lots of plotting (GOTesq) and I'm sure I will watch the whole series.BUT... what is going on with the sets/location? I know they are not real, it's 17th century Japan. But they look so fake. They have that over lit perfectness you see in video games. Plus stuff in the background of scenes is in focus, like whoever created them hadn't heard of depth of field.There is a scene towards the end of E2 with two characters in the foreground that are in focus and a building that must be several miles away is also in focus...weird.Then in other scenes they have purposefully blurred parts of the actors bodies, such as feet or hands, obviously done in post to add fake DOF.Anyway, if you can ignore all that, it's pretty decent.	watch first two episode pretty good lot interest stuff happen story build nicely decent act lot plot gotesq sure watch whole series go set location know real th century japan look fake light perfectness see video game plus stuff background scene focus like whoever create hear depth field scene towards end e two character foreground focus build must several mile away also focus weird scene purposefully blur part actor body foot hand obviously do post add fake dof anyway ignore pretty decent

1	"Shogun is a great production with good actors, costumes, scenery, music, etc. A strong point would be its multilingual and cultural aspect, as the Japanese and English have their languages respected. It is unbelievable that the dialogues between the supposed ""Portuguese"" people are all in English, which often makes a scene incomprehensible, for example in E2, in which a Portuguese priest and Mariki ""translate"" a conversation with Blachthorne (who claims to be fluent in Portuguese) to Toranaga, but their ""translation"" is entirely from English to Japanese. In another scene, the same Portuguese priest, alternating between Japanese and English languages (with maybe an exagereted ""Portuguese"" accent), compliments Mariki for her ""excellent Portuguese"". Nonsense! It is not enough to avoid ""yellow face"" and other prejudiced aberrations and remain with this ridiculous language segregation. A shame."	shogun great production good actor costume scenery music etc strong point would multilingual cultural aspect japanese english language respect unbelievable dialogue suppose portuguese people english often make scene incomprehensible example e portuguese priest mariki translate conversation blachthorne claim fluent portuguese toranaga translation entirely english japanese another scene portuguese priest alternate japanese english language maybe exagerete portuguese accent compliment mariki excellent portuguese nonsense enough avoid yellow face prejudice aberration remain ridiculous language segregation shame

1	"I wanted to give this series a much lower rating, but the overall production quality garners a few stars more. Walton Goggins helps the rating as well. However, you can tell this is a Bethesda take on the IP, and that's not a good thing. It's too clean, too playful. Fallout IS gritty and raw. The ""gory"" scenes in this even seem out of place, which is odd considering it's in the Fallout universe.Everyone seems to be praising the effects teams, and the majority of it is well done, but I'm a bit disappointed in the BoS power armor. For something that is not CGI, it looks like bad CGI. Not sure how that happens.If you only like Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, you'll probably like this. If you like Fallout 1, 2, and New Vegas, you'll probably just feel obligated to watch this. If you don't know what I'm talking about, well ignorance is bliss.

2	First of all I would like to highlight that I haven't play the game, I just knew for its existence. So my review is based clearly on the serie and nothing else.I'm a fan of the vintage vibe, I love everything of the 60'. I also love movies and series that refers to a post-apocalyptic world, so as you understand this serie it's the best combination for me and it didn't disappoint me at all. It's a very well made, the production is amazing. I loved the cinematography and the music of the 60', you get definitely to the mood which I believe is the half of the serie. The acting of the cast is also good, nothing special but yet not disappointed. As I know there will be another season and I'm glad for it because not all of your questions are get an answer. It's a kind of a serie that will make you play the game eventually and as I heard the sales of the game have been increased after the launch of the serie.I would definitely recommend to watch it either you played the game or not!!!	first would like highlight play game know existence review base clearly serie nothing else fan vintage vibe love everything also love movie series refer post apocalyptic world understand serie good combination disappoint well make production amaze love cinematography music get definitely mood believe half serie act cast also good nothing special yet disappoint know another season glad question get answer kind serie make play game eventually hear sale game increase launch serie would definitely recommend watch either play game

2	This is going to upset fans of the novel series, which I also read, begrudgingly. I kept reading because the story was so fascinating. I couldn't stop, but the way it was written was confusing as hell. Almost on purpose it felt like it was trying to convince the reader it should re-read the last three pages to try to understand what the hell is happening. I was so happy to hear this was going to Netflix because I knew that they could not make it the same way the books were because nobody would watch it. I was pleasantly surprised they are capturing the essence of the story, while the more confusing aspects nonexistent. Great show.	go upset fan novel series also read begrudgingly keep read story fascinate stop way write confuse hell almost purpose feel like try convince reader read last three page try understand hell happen happy hear go netflix know could make way book nobody would watch pleasantly surprise capture essence story confuse aspect nonexistent great show
2	I went to bed thinking about this show and finished it the next day as I couldn't think past.This type of show will stay with you for a long time. I saw a reviewer say how stalkers are glamourised in media, think Netflix's You. This raw and haunting story of comedian Richard Gadd's real life experience of being stalked by a woman he met in a pub and befriended, shows a dark and refreshingly honest portrayal of a terrible stalking experience.Not only do we see the reasons behind why he did what he did, why he didn't stop when all the signs where pointing to danger, but the background to Richard / Donny's life is so incredibly brave.Rarely do we see this story line in the media happening to men, although it happens very frequently to women in movies and tv, and for that I think it will strike a chord with many people. I won't elaborate on this more without giving too much away.To summarise, this show is a must watch, but be warned it is not an easy watch and should come with trigger warnings.	go bed think show finish next day think past type show stay long time see reviewer say stalker glamourise medium think netflix raw haunt story comedian richard gadd real life experience stalk woman meet pub befriend show dark refreshingly honest portrayal terrible stalk experience see reason behind stop sign point danger background richard donny life incredibly brave rarely see story line medium happen man although happen frequently woman movie tv think strike chord many people elaborate without give much away summarise show must watch warn easy watch come trigger warn
2	"Before discovering this mini-series, I recently revisited the previous version.I don't believe every remake should be compared, but it's in human nature to do so.I agree with the comments about the black and white; I don't think it was necessary, and it would have been better in color. But I got used to it along the way.I generally liked that most of the show was in Italian; I suppose it also made me watch more attentively as I needed to follow subtitles along the way.Although there were some key differences from the previous versions, mainly how Tom lived his ""Dickie"" life, I also enjoyed this version. Sometimes it stagnated, especially in the middle parts, and I think it got more exciting in the last 1-2 episodes. In the middle parts, I found myself asking how come he makes all these mistakes, which felt contradictory to his character and experience. Then in the last episodes, they pulled it off in a better way. Acting was well done, especially Andrew Scott as the lead, which was expected from my end. I am not going into the details, but I generally enjoyed it; still, I think it could've been better."	discover mini series recently revisit previous version believe every remake compare human nature agree comment black white think necessary would well color get use along way generally like show italian suppose also make watch attentively need follow subtitle along way although key difference previous version mainly tom live dickie life also enjoy version sometimes stagnate especially middle part think get excite last episode middle part find ask come make mistake feel contradictory character experience last episode pull well way act well do especially andrew scott lead expect end go detail generally enjoy still think could well

Pretty small font on a smartphone screen so numerous times I've had to pause and zoom to read them.

I'm about 3/4 the way through Season 3 and will try to stick it out because of Nathan Fillion, but I doubt I'll make it much farther.It pains me to give the show one star because I love Nathan Fillion, but this show is now terrible. I never watched Castle, but I know he was great in that because my mother used to watch it and I had seen scenes when I would visit her.Of course, he was amazing in Firefly and Serenity as well as his many cameos in various shows (Big Bang Theory, Modern Family, et al) and Cayde-6 in the Destiny series.

Today I clicked over to IMDb, wondering whether other people also started out really enjoying the series then became frustrated by the increasing preachy-ness. Yep.The show had so much going for it. Engaging characters, great action, just the right amount of humor, interesting and often unpredictable plots (both within an episode and multi-episode story arcs)...All that in addition to wrestling with complex issues faced by cops and society as a whole. That's great. That aspect gives the show heart and makes it more interesting.But then season 3 came. The writers got lazy, handing us lame dialogue, cardboard characters, and woke ideology served straight up. Remember, Rookie team, that most people watch a TV show to be entertained. If I want moralizing and preaching, I'll go to church or watch a Greta Thunberg clip.Please, get back to the season 1 vibe!"	little way season rookie today click imdb wonder whether people also start really enjoy series become frustrate increase preachy ness yep show much go engage character great action right amount humor interest often unpredictable plot within episode multi episode story arc addition wrestle complex issue face cop society whole great aspect give show heart make interest season come writer get lazy hand we lame dialogue cardboard character wake ideology serve straight remember rookie team people watch tv show entertain want moralize preach go church watch greta thunberg clip please get back season vibe

At times I wished it would burst into colour as I remember the film which was very colorful and Italy is best served in colour. But the subject also excellently fits black and white.

1	A bit disappointed.I sense this has been made with a touch of fear & a lack of respect for the original story. And as such it is simply based on the book & not an adaptation.But as a stand alone effort, it's okay.When I write, made with fear, this is what I mean:The brutality of the Samurai Japanese way of life has been powder-puffed over.But that way of life, the ying & yang of brutality & beauty is essential to the story & what makes feudal Japan so fascinating. The Book is packed with this juxtaposition as is the 1980 miniseries. It is so essential to the story.The casting of John Blackthorn is also disappointing. Blackthorn is a big/tall, 6ft+ northern European man. Packing power in all physical places.The casting of this sub 6ft, blue contact wearing actor, doing a Richard Burton impression, is also questionable. But he does okay.Shogun, is supposed to be the story of John Blackthorn, set in the world of feudal Japan. His journey through that world & his relationship with that world's puppet master as seen through both men's eyes.This miniseries almost makes Blackthorn irrelevant in his own story.This story, at times, is also unnecessary crass which undermines a pivot that Shogun revolves around. I repeat, unnecessarily crass & unauthentic. They have got Mariko wrong & the brush of girl power plays unauthentic & silly.I don't know if budget or bad choices led to important parts being cut, either way, it doesn't help.This miniseries as a stand alone, is not bad. It's just not an authentic, Shogun.	bite disappoint sense make touch fear lack respect original story simply base book adaptation stand alone effort okay write make fear mean brutality samurai japanese way life powder puff way life ying yang brutality beauty essential story make feudal japan fascinate book pack juxtaposition miniserie essential story cast john blackthorn also disappoint blackthorn big tall ft northern european man pack power physical place cast sub ft blue contact wear actor richard burton impression also questionable okay shogun suppose story john blackthorn set world feudal japan journey world relationship world puppet master see man eye miniserie almost make blackthorn irrelevant story story time also unnecessary crass undermine pivot shogun revolve around repeat unnecessarily crass unauthentic get mariko wrong brush girl power play unauthentic silly know budget bad choice lead important part cut either way help miniserie stand alone bad authentic shogun
2	Three Body Problem on Netflix has more DNA from Jonathan Nolan's HBO Westworld than any other series I know of. Even tho I loved Jonathan Nolan's Person of Interest series, I did not care for the Westworld series. Why? It seemed pretentious; and, its narrative was disjointed to no benefit for viewers. These are typical signs of a project which has some good ideas and a big bugget; and yet, no deeply held conviction nor point of view.1899 (2022) was an expensive Netflix flop. It basically repeated the same errors as Westworld.Three Body Problem on Netflix has learned from Westworld and 1899 and corrects these exact errors. Thanks to the author Cixin Liu, the seemingly separate, disjointed storylines of the original novel can and do come together into a coherent whole. Success. It's very watchable.2) A second big problem Netflix's Three Body Problem solves is the problem of Asian actors having insufficient emotional range and nuance to engage Western audiences. Have you noticed this? Many not all Japanese, Korean and especially Chinese movies and actors have no problem with anger, grief and sadness. However more nuanced emotions between and above these basic emotions often escape them. This review is not the place to compare-contrast the strengths and weaknesses of Eastern and Western European cultures.Suffice it to say, ALL the leads in Three Body Problem do express a range of emotional nuance Western which can and does engage Western audiences. We even have two actors playing against type. BD Wong a hero in Marvel's Dr. Strange, plays a shlubby detective. BD has always had good range; he fits into this part very well. John Bradley, who played the comical conspiracy theorist 1899 (2022) was an expensive Netflix flop. It basically repeated the same errors as Westworld.Three Body Problem on Netflix has learned from Westworld and 1899 and corrects these exact errors. Thanks to the author Cixin Liu, the seemingly separate, disjointed storylines of the original novel can and do come together into a coherent whole. Success. It's very watchable.Eiza González, a Mexican actress, Jess Hong, a New Zealand actress of Chinese descent; and, Rosalind Chao (born in California of Chinese descent) are all more than capable of expressing a depth of feeling and nuance Western audiences are used to and will engage with.3) The VFX for Three Body Problem display Netflix's usual high standards for both creativity and quality.	three body problem netflix dna jonathan nolan hbo westworld series know even tho love jonathan nolan person interest series care westworld series seem pretentious narrative disjoint benefit viewer typical sign project good idea big bugget yet deeply hold conviction point view expensive netflix flop basically repeat error westworld three body problem netflix learn westworld correct exact error thank author cixin liu seemingly separate disjoint storyline original novel come together coherent whole success watchable second big problem netflix three body problem solve problem asian actor insufficient emotional range nuance engage western audience notice many japanese korean especially chinese movie actor problem anger grief sadness however nuance emotion basic emotion often escape review place compare contrast strength weakness eastern western european culture suffice say lead three body problem express range emotional nuance western engage western audience even two actor play type bd wong hero marvel dr strange play shlubby detective bd always good range fit part well john bradley play comical conspiracy theorist expensive netflix flop basically repeat error westworld three body problem netflix learn westworld correct exact error thank author cixin liu seemingly separate disjoint storyline original novel come together coherent whole success watchable eiza gonz lez mexican actress jess hong new zealand actress chinese descent rosalind chao bear california chinese descent capable express depth feel nuance western audience use engage vfx three body problem display netflix usual high standard creativity quality

2	The effect when you watch such a finely detailed show as this is mesmerizing, it sucks you into the world and time ... and the culture.Before an actor utters a single word in any episode there is the fact and nature of the world building that has been done in order to give them a stage to perform on. In the case of Shogun what has been accomplished is astounding, but it really comes into its own when the camera is tight and the sets and shots are relatively tightly constrained. Up close this world is utterly convincing - the costuming extraordinary.The script is also exceptionally well written and manages to convey a deep sense of Japanese culture (primarily of the upper classes) - but also tells its story very economically - it provides ample opportunity for nuanced communication.This brings us to the actors and the director and cinematographer who captured these subtleties - not easy to do with a light touch, managed here very deftly. The result is a show not over burdened with dialogue that tells part of its story some of its most significant moments, with gesture and response, subtle character action, a glance here, a hand movement, a tilt of the body, or the sweeping swish of fabric before composure again. On this level the show and its actors are quite magnificent - but there is room for special mention.Anna Sawai as Mariko is as refined and elegant as you'd expect from a high born and well educated noblewoman of the era, she is thoroughly steeped in the culture, captured here in very fine detail - Sawai's minute control is truly something to behold - very special indeed. So also Hiroyuki Sanada as Lord Toranaga - another brilliant and subtle performance from this fine actor.I've read some nasty dismissal of Cosmo Jarvis' Blackthorne - they miss the point. Of course he is uncouth, brash, insensitive. Of course his energy clashes with everything around him and he seems clumsy and arrogant and a bit useless. That IS the point, and the reality. His character is completely out of time and place - culturally he may as well be on another planet. The way he walks and moves is an affront to centuries of careful aesthetic, the way he sits, the way he drinks, the way he looks at people - all a culture shock. English arrogance and insensitivity gets a turn in front of the mirror. Well done.This show is sensational and ticks all the boxes - brilliant work by all involved. Not to be missed.	effect watch finely detail show mesmerize suck world time culture actor utter single word episode fact nature world build do order give stage perform case shogun accomplish astound really come camera tight set shot relatively tightly constrain close world utterly convince costume extraordinary script also exceptionally well write manage convey deep sense japanese culture primarily upper class also tell story economically provide ample opportunity nuance communication bring we actor director cinematographer capture subtlety easy light touch manage deftly result show burden dialogue tell part story significant moment gesture response subtle character action glance hand movement tilt body sweep swish fabric composure level show actor quite magnificent room special mention anna sawai mariko refine elegant expect high bear well educate noblewoman era thoroughly steep culture capture fine detail sawai minute control truly something behold special indeed also hiroyuki sanada lord toranaga another brilliant subtle performance fine actor read nasty dismissal cosmo jarvis blackthorne miss point course uncouth brash insensitive course energy clash everything around seem clumsy arrogant bite useless point reality character completely time place culturally may well another planet way walk move affront century careful aesthetic way sit way drink way look people culture shock english arrogance insensitivity get turn front mirror well do show sensational tick box brilliant work involve miss
2	Everything about this series is done to perfection; the cinematography, the use of black and white, the costume design, the sound, the story, and of course the performances. Things not seemingly obvious are crafted with rigorous attention. The clomping of footsteps, heavy wooden doors closing, the clanging of typewriters, and heavy everyday objects add both to the overarching tension and to the nostalgia of a pre-computerized time. To add to this is the clean everyday formal wear adorning all of the characters in stark darks and bright whites, all set against the vertical architecture of Italy, and drenched in crisp black and white film stock. It's nothing short of brilliant.Andrew Scott shines as the most charismatic antagonist of today. Even though his character's actions are despicable, you're never rooting for his demise; in fact, you're secretly rooting for him to get away with his crimes.Dakota Fanning said that Steven Zaillian, the writer and director, had everything planned in meticulous detail, and it shows. I won't give away any of the plot, but do yourself a favor and start this series. Extremely bingeable and wholly engaging. A++.	everything series do perfection cinematography use black white costume design sound story course performance thing seemingly obvious craft rigorous attention clomp footstep heavy wooden door close clang typewriter heavy everyday object add overarch tension nostalgia pre computerize time add clean everyday formal wear adorn character stark dark bright white set vertical architecture italy drench crisp black white film stock nothing short brilliant andrew scott shin charismatic antagonist today even though character action despicable never root demise fact secretly root get away crime dakota fan say steven zaillian writer director everything plan meticulous detail show give away plot favor start series extremely bingeable wholly engage

0	I haven't watched a show in many months and tried this one after seeing it as #1 on Netflix. What a disgusting, pathetic show with a complete and total loser of a main character. This is a completely overrated show and is very horrible. The only good thing about it is that you may feel better about yourself after watching this mess. The main character is the probably more pathetic and a bigger loser than his stalker. I watched the first 3 episodes and didn't think it was that good and neither did my wife. But, episode 4 came on and it was a completely different show and it made us sick. Do not watch this, it will be stuck in your soul forever and that is not a good thing.	watch show many month try one see netflix disgust pathetic show complete total loser main character completely overrate show horrible good thing may feel well watch mess main character probably pathetic big loser stalker watch first episode think good neither wife episode come completely different show make we sick watch stick soul forever good thing
0	This series fails on two levels. First, it fails to live up to the novel on which it is based. Then, it fails simply on its own. The treatment of the characters is so shallow that it affects our ability to understand their actions or to find them sympathetic. The story is told in a choppy, highly compressed way with lots of cuts that create needless confusion. (If you are going to waste 8 hours on this, you should probably watch a few episodes at a time so the flashbacks and jumps make sense.) The original characters are changed to fit modern DEI requirements and the casting is so ridiculous it must have been done by the beta version of Google Gemini. Yes, sure, quantum physicists can pout and gaze vacantly and wear a lot of lip gloss, but this group of five are highly implausible as five Oxford physics geniuses. Tik Tok influencers? Sure. Reality show stars? Absolutely. But not five great scientists.I have never seen the Chinese TV version. Perhaps someday there will be a new attempt at a Western version. For now, the original trilogy, in print, may be the best bet.	series fail two level first fail live novel base fail simply treatment character shallow affect ability understand action find sympathetic story tell choppy highly compress way lot cut create needle confusion go waste hour probably watch episode time flashback jump make sense original character change fit modern dei requirement cast ridiculous must do beta version google gemini yes sure quantum physicist pout gaze vacantly wear lot lip gloss group five highly implausible five oxford physics geniuse tik tok influencer sure reality show star absolutely five great scientist never see chinese tv version perhaps someday new attempt western version original trilogy print may well bet

1	I really enjoy this show...up to a point. I've rewatched seasons 1-13ish many times. But after that it turned just unwatchable. Why they haven't stopped the show is baffling. But again, the beginning seasons were great, great storylines and great characters. Then they decide to kill off your favorite characters or give them awful reasons to leave the show and recycle story lines over and over. And apparently all of the writers of the show hate happy couples because no couple is safe on this show...NO couple. And then of course they had to add the stupid covid crap and political nonsense into a whole season and it was just the worst thing I've seen. So again...great show, but stop after season 13.	really enjoy show point rewatche season ish many time turn unwatchable stop show baffle begin season great great storyline great character decide kill favorite character give awful reason leave show recycle story line apparently writer show hate happy couple couple safe show couple course add stupid covid crap political nonsense whole season bad thing see great show stop season
1	This is an interesting story told reasonably well but let down by some poor scriptwriting and poor pacing. The characters are, by and large, acceptable but Liam Cunningham is alone in being head and shoulders above the rest of the cast. There's little tension at any point which doesn't engender any real commitment to the series. Scientifically it is typical tv sci-fi so nitpicking is pointless but some errors are unacceptable. My favourite is the scene when the plate on the spacecraft holding the cable attached to the sail comes loose. It is evidently held in place by screws (or, at best ,small bolts). It's a jerry-built spacecraft which so easily could have looked like it was built by people who knew what they were doing.	interest story tell reasonably well let poor scriptwrite poor pace character large acceptable liam cunningham alone head shoulder rest cast little tension point engender real commitment series scientifically typical tv sci fi nitpick pointless error unacceptable favourite scene plate spacecraft hold cable attach sail come loose evidently hold place screw good small bolt jerry build spacecraft easily could look like build people know
2	"Ripley is a captivating exploration of envy and fear, brought to life through stellar acting and a striking black-and-white cinematography. The contrast between the luminous beauty of Italy and the dark, brooding emotions of Tom Ripley is brilliantly portrayed, emphasizing the inner turmoil of Highsmith's complex character. Each scene is masterfully crafted to capture the essence of Ripley's psyche, thanks to the nuanced performances that breathe life into the characters. The serie pays homage to Highsmith's skill in character creation, delving deep into the intricate layers of human nature with a keen eye for detail. Overall, ""Ripley"" is a cinematic masterpiece that skillfully navigates the delicate balance between light and darkness, both visually and emotionally."	ripley captivate exploration envy fear bring life stellar act strike black white cinematography contrast luminous beauty italy dark brood emotion tom ripley brilliantly portray emphasize inner turmoil highsmith complex character scene masterfully craft capture essence ripley psyche thank nuance performance breathe life character serie pay homage highsmith skill character creation delve deep intricate layer human nature keen eye detail overall ripley cinematic masterpiece skillfully navigate delicate balance light darkness visually emotionally

1	So I've been watching this show for the past 4 months or so with my husband and it began pretty decent, with good laughs here and there. But after the main characters began to die or leave, it is not only boring, but the plot feels empty, like put together using the force, which is exactly what they are doing with their ridiculous situations where I find myself not laughing but wondering why I'm losing my time. So I stopped the first 4 ep of season 12.	watch show past month husband begin pretty decent good laugh main character begin die leave bore plot feel empty like put together use force exactly ridiculous situation find laugh wonder lose time stop first ep season
1	I had high hopes for this series, but it disappoints. The unrelenting monochrome is harsh and seems like a mannerism.Andrew Scott, a fine actor, is sadly too old for the role, and doesn't get the sinister aspects of the role. Dakota Fanning and (especially) Johnny Flynn are somewhat more successful.But the least good aspect of this series is the pace. It is glacially slow, and my mind wandered several times. I feel the director is over indulgent. The camera lingers painfully slowly over the mundane. This means the series is a couple of episodes too long, and the last few episodes are especially frustrating with a noticeable lack of tension.Basically this was a wasted opportunity.	high hop series disappoint unrelenting monochrome harsh seem like mannerism andrew scott fine actor sadly old role get sinister aspect role dakota fan especially johnny flynn somewhat successful least good aspect series pace glacially slow mind wander several time feel director indulgent camera linger painfully slowly mundane mean series couple episode long last episode especially frustrate noticeable lack tension basically waste opportunity
0	"I want to first state that I have not read the books, but have heard great things about them from others who have. Therefore, I was pretty excited to start this series. I am not sure how much was adapted from the book or how true the series is to the original. But I sincerely hope the books are a lot better than this.To start, this show is unpredictable, but not in the good way. More in like a ""there's no way this really stupid or random thing is going to happen, that would make no sense at all"" - but then it does happen, way. I will not spoil anything, but the ship scene comes to mind. This was an incredibly dumb and horrific event that had absolutely no reason to it. There are about 6000 other ways that the ship scenario could have been handled better and more realistically. Like I truly cannot put into to words how little sense went into that decision making. There are also various other scenes where characters make choices that are so random or outside of their ideals. This makes it hard to care about any of the characters, because none of them actually have true values or conflicts. There is only one character worth rooting for, but they are the one with the shortest amount of screen time.That's another issue I had, the characters and acting are just so bad. They add a bunch of forced scenes where the characters sit and have ""deep"" talks with each other, but it ends up being so boring and forced. In reality we learn so little about each of the main characters. The most I can say about them is: there's one who knows absolutely everything about physics, there's one who is pessimistic and just wants the world to die off, the rich finance one, and there's the Mexican one (I say that because that is literally the only information the show constantly throws at us about her).Overall the show follows no logic, is extremely underwhelming, and very rushed."	want first state read book hear great thing other therefore pretty excite start series sure much adapt book true series original sincerely hope book lot well start show unpredictable good way like way really stupid random thing go happen would make sense happen way spoil anything ship scene come mind incredibly dumb horrific event absolutely reason way ship scenario could handle well realistically like truly put word little sense go decision make also various scene character make choice random outside ideal make hard care character none actually true value conflict one character worth root one short amount screen time another issue character act bad add bunch force scene character sit deep talk end bore force reality learn little main character say one know absolutely everything physic one pessimistic want world die rich finance one mexican one say literally information show constantly throw we overall show follow logic extremely underwhelme rush

Highly irritating female characters , especially those portrayed by Melissa O'Neill and Jasmine Mathews . Also , rather poor acting by these two .

2	There's a reason this TV adaptation is titled Ripley and not The Talented Mr Ripley. Or even, as another producer might have styled it: Patricia Highsmith's Mr Ripley. And that's because - although plot-wise this TV version stays much closer to the book than the 1999 movie - this is not Patricia Highsmith's Ripley. It is very much Steven Zaillian's Ripley. And, as such, it is first and foremost a director's exercise in film noir. So far as that goes, it is an exceptioinally stylish and moody recreation of noir. But while Highsmith's characters and story certainly lend themselves to a more broody treatment, Zaillian hasn't necessarily done Highsmith any favours in the scripting. The three main characters all become somewhat flat, and often more arch than real. Casting Tom with an older actor renders the character something of a seedy and desperate loser; it's not so easy to admire is ingenuity, or forgive his avarice. By contrast, the movie version is sexy and glamorous, and positively bursting with energy and passion. You instantly get why Marge loves Jude Law's Dicky, and why Tom wants to be him. Johnny Flynn? Not so much. Also, whjile Zaillian is all about maintaining the tension and the suspense, he also makes some choices that seriously undermine any plot credibility. It's bad enough that the police apparently fail to ever obtain a phot of the real Richard Greenleaf. But Zaillian has Marge sell her story to TWO Italian publications, who both choose to run stories about the Greenleaf disappearance with a selection of Marge's photographs - but not a single one of Richard. As if. Ultimately, Zaillian's focus on the intense press coverage of the case proves his undoing. Are we really supposed to believe that none of Italy's newspapers ever thought to obtain a photo of Richard Greenleaf from his parents, or his Princeton friends, or a college year book? Overall, while I enjoyed Andrew Scott's Ripley, Matt Damon's movie version is more engaging, more complex and more moving. Damon's Mr Ripley is genuinely *talented* and you're ultimately touched by his yearning and his despair. Scott's Ripley is, in fact, not talented at all; he mostly outsmarts himself, he's creepy as hell, and you mostly think he deserves to be caught. Which makes him not half as much fun as Highsmith intended.	reason tv adaptation title ripley talente mr ripley even another producer might style patricia highsmith mr ripley although plot wise tv version stay much close book movie patricia highsmith ripley much steven zaillian ripley first foremost director exercise film noir far go exceptioinally stylish moody recreation noir highsmith character story certainly lend broody treatment zaillian necessarily do highsmith favour script three main character become somewhat flat often arch real cast tom old actor render character something seedy desperate loser easy admire ingenuity forgive avarice contrast movie version sexy glamorous positively burst energy passion instantly get marge love jude law dicky tom want johnny flynn much also whjile zaillian maintain tension suspense also make choice seriously undermine plot credibility bad enough police apparently fail ever obtain phot real richard greenleaf zaillian marge sell story two italian publication choose run story greenleaf disappearance selection marge photograph single one richard ultimately zaillian focus intense press coverage case prove undo really suppose believe none italy newspaper ever think obtain photo richard greenleaf parent princeton friends college year book overall enjoy andrew scott ripley matt damon movie version engage complex move damon mr ripley genuinely talente ultimately touch yearn despair scott ripley fact talente mostly outsmart creepy hell mostly think deserve catch make half much fun highsmith intend

1	The early seasons were silly, but plausible. After Derek died, the storyline's got more and more ridiculous. It's hilariously stupid now.As far as a TV medical show, it's fairly predictable: fans of medical dramas will diagnose a patient half an hour before these doctors do, lots of crazy patients, and inoperable tumours which miraculously explain outrageous behaviours and come out easily with no downtime.Some episodes cover several months, which is annoying. Others gloss over incidents which should have been given more attention.Great guest stars though.	early season silly plausible derek die storyline get ridiculous hilariously stupid far tv medical show fairly predictable fan medical drama diagnose patient half hour doctor lot crazy patient inoperable tumour miraculously explain outrageous behaviour come easily downtime episode cover several month annoy other gloss incident give attention great guest star though
1	I think Merideth should be spending more time with her kids, and at her job. She hasn't showed the dedication she usually does for her job and her kids. I think Amelia spend more time with her kids than she does. Her new boyfriend is not working, he doesn't seem to care about her job (either one) or her kids. He wants To be her #1. And that goes to her kids. I would love to see her dedication to both her jobs and her kids. Much is selfish. Amelia and the other woman seem to do more than Meredith. If she isn't working she needs to be the mom she wanted to be. I really think Nick is bad for the show.	think merideth spend time kid job show dedication usually job kid think amelia spend time kid new boyfriend work seem care job either one kid want go kid would love see dedication job kid much selfish amelia woman seem meredith work need mom want really think nick bad show
1	I read the original so obviously they bias my opinion. In the case of Avatar: The Last Airbender, I thought their choices where good. But, in the case of 3 Body Problem I'm not quite feeling it.For the first 5 episodes I was loving it. I had no issues with the changes in characters nor how they squeezed things to fit into the shorter time. But, from episode 5 on it just went downhill for me. The changes didn't seem like they added to the story or add to it. Rather they seemed like poor writing and bad ideas being jammed into the story with cliched scenes and responces. It started turning into a soap opera instead of hard scifiI wanted to reach through the screen and punch the nanotech scientist who couldn't understand the stakes. I didn't buy for a second someone that smart could be that stupid. Bad writing.The lead physics expert's scenes trying to convince her dying friend to, instead of do something amazing and meaningful with his last few days should instead sit in bed suffering. Probably the single worst writing ever. How they changed what actually happens to him also seems like it's going to turn into a new fiasco since it seems unsalvageable in any believable way to its importants later.Of course I'll keep watching, but it just goes to show how in the same way the producers ruined Game of Thrones it appears likely they're going to ruin 3 Body Problem as well. I don't mind if they change it. I mind that that changes are bad.	read original obviously bias opinion case avatar last airbender think choice good case body problem quite feel first episode love issue change character squeeze thing fit short time episode go downhill change seem like add story add rather seem like poor write bad idea jam story cliche scene responce start turn soap opera instead hard scifii want reach screen punch nanotech scientist understand stake buy second someone smart could stupid bad write lead physics expert scene try convince die friend instead something amaze meaningful last day instead sit bed suffer probably single bad write ever change actually happen also seem like go turn new fiasco since seem unsalvageable believable way important later course keep watch go show way producer ruin game throne appear likely go ruin body problem well mind change mind change bad

All scenes seem fake, that voiceover annoys the hell out of me and on top of that it is really really boring.Honestly I do not understand the good rating. It is an absolute shame on Colin Farrels talent.I have a pretty high tolerance for not too good tv, can look beyond ridiculousness in a lot of series as long as there is a compelling story. This just does not bring that to the table.

0	Andrew scott is too old to play this role, Matt damon was the perfect choice, the right age plus the slight resemblance with Judd low, that served the plot. Dacota fanning is so depressing and showed no emotions whatsoever she acted the same as she did in The mentalist. Too long unnecessary seens. I surely respect the black and white shooting , it created an atmosphere of the 60's but it deprived me from watching Italy and it's beauty. Couldn't understand how naive was the police inspector to be easily deceived by the funny disguise of Tom ripley on their last encounter and of course missing on the ashtray on which he commented earlier , for me it wasn't fun to watch.	andrew scott old play role matt damon perfect choice right age plus slight resemblance judd low serve plot dacota fan depress show emotion whatsoever act mentalist long unnecessary seen surely respect black white shoot create atmosphere deprive watch italy beauty understand naive police inspector easily deceive funny disguise tom ripley last encounter course miss ashtray comment early fun watch
1	Just finishing watching episode 1-5, and to be honest, the characters are fine, the pace of story telling is fine, and I really enjoyed how it put the story of the past into the story of current.However, WHY SO MANY ROMANTIC STRUGGLES? Dose Netflix have to shape characters by putting them into so many romantic relationships? They deleted so many important clues in the game and the deductions about how Jin realized that the problem in the game is three body problems. It's not that hard style sci-fic, more like a sci-fic soap opera.And, WHY PUT KIDS ON THE SHIP? There was no kid on the ship in original story so WHY BE SO CRUEL?	finish watch episode honest character fine pace story tell fine really enjoy put story past story current however many romantic struggle dose netflix shape character put many romantic relationship delete many important clue game deduction jin realize problem game three body problem hard style sci fic like sci fic soap opera put kid ship kid ship original story cruel

However I do have to mention that over the last seasons I can say that the storyline isn't great as if the original cast was still here that would've been amazing.

1	Unfortunately this good show has deteriorated over the years with the current season hitting an all ever low... If identity politics is what you are after or the propaganda of racial issues is your jam you will like it, if not you should skip. Real sad because the actors are still great and it feels like their story is betrayed... alas all is ruined by the agenda, since everything it touches in entertainment is then focused on hitting its marks instead of producing good entertainment, nothing is spared, not even classics of cinema, let alone a 'modern' series like Grey.edit: By episode 5 (S17) it truly became unbearable to watch so I guess all things that used to be good must come to an end too. I am speechless... this is so sad and it used to be good. Now a flimsy soap opera with an overpowering serving of Black lives matter every other scene, not to mention how out of character that behaviour is for all cast but one. So off-putting! I'm out.

But, it looked intriguing so my family and I decided to check it out. I'm so glad we did. The storyline is compelling and unique and the graphics are nothing short of amazing. We love science fiction and this show does a good job of blending sci-fi with human drama and intimate personal relationships. The acting is solid. The only critique I have is that physicists who look like supermodels is not that believable but this is TV so it's to be expected. The international cast is nice to see and we can't wait to see what the next season brings.	never read book even hear story come netflix even watch trailer confuse story look intrigue family decide check glad storyline compel unique graphic nothing short amaze love science fiction show good job blend sci fi human drama intimate personal relationship act solid critique physicist look like supermodel believable tv expect international cast nice see wait see next season bring

Obviously faster than a military jet according to the time line in Season 7.Season 7 reminds me of Guy Ricchi's King Arthur movie - you can't believe what you are seeing, checking if you are not in some alternate reality.I hope the people writing the GOT script take some pointers from my review and rethink the future last season.	start watch get season hook daenery astapor scene become fan series thrill wait season stupid plot mindless decision main character stupidity capital tyrion know previous season wonder daenery follow idiotic plan advise even qarth act erratic huge plot hole like fast raven fly north south obviously fast military jet accord time line season season remind guy ricchi king arthur movie believe see check alternate reality hope people write get script take pointer review rethink future last season

1	This reboot is not as good as the original which is one of my favorite tv shows of all time. Despite enjoying the Japanese spoken (I speak it), the characters are not as compelling as the original. They seem to be one dimensional in comparison. Also, the script and storyline is much more haphazard. I can only assume the producers and writers thought this would be a more interesting and complex format. Instead, I feel the actors lack direction and often seem to just be reading the lines as best they can. My main concern though is the lack of character exploration which I feel the original series did in a much better fashion. Seeing Blackthorne become Anjin was a much more fulfilling experience in the original series for example. Still, compared to the typical dribble out there, it's decent.	reboot good original one favorite tv show time despite enjoy japanese speak speak character compel original seem one dimensional comparison also script storyline much haphazard assume producer writer think would interest complex format instead feel actor lack direction often seem read line good main concern though lack character exploration feel original series much well fashion see blackthorne become anjin much fulfil experience original series example still compare typical dribble decent

The locations are great, the VFX is decent, there is a respect for source material which is good. It is nice that the Japanese actually speak Japanese ... Overall I would suggest watching ""Age of Samurai"" documentary before this as it perfectly sets the scene to understand which period this story covers. The only thing that this show is inferior to the original is the main actor can not replace Richard Chamberlain, nor anybody can replace John Rhys-Davies well enough , those actors were legendary, that is why 1980's version is totally worth a rewatch..."	fan old shogun richard chamberlain enjoy retell original story big time far story follow quite precisely good thing location great vfx decent respect source material good nice japanese actually speak japanese overall would suggest watch age samurai documentary perfectly set scene understand period story cover thing show inferior original main actor replace richard chamberlain anybody replace john rhys davie well enough actor legendary version totally worth rewatch
1	First off, I have played the games, NewVegas being my favorite.I like the the very start when the bombs dropped... but I'm having problems with the rest.. Goggins as 'the ghoul' is 🔥. Lucy is OK.I hate everything with the Brotherhood. The whole operation isn't lore accurate and the whole storyline could (and should) be eliminated from the show... make them an outlying force with very limited interaction... what's been written here is junk.The pacing is garbage and some editorial choices are baffling.I basically liked the wasteland roadtrip vibe and the vault story.The show looks great, the soundtrack is great, though a tad overused.Overall. Tolerable... I won't rewatch and I won't beg for Season 2 (I might watch season 2, but I can take it or leave it.)	first play game newvegas favorite like start bomb drop problem rest goggins ghoul lucy ok hate everything brotherhood whole operation lore accurate whole storyline could eliminate show make outlying force limit interaction write junk pace garbage editorial choice baffle basically like wasteland roadtrip vibe vault story show look great soundtrack great though tad overuse overall tolerable rewatch beg season might watch season take leave
2	"The show was great, as a sci-fi fan, I absolutely loved it. Probably one of the best sci-fi shows I've seen in a while. Casting could've been a bit better but the story was interesting and thought provoking enough to keep me binge-watching. Don't mind the haters who rated 1/10 just 'cause they think it wasn't ""loyal"" to the books. If it's based on a book not every movie/show has to be loyal to the books, it just could be a different or altered version of it or there'll be some changes or some deficiencies because books are way too detailed and they need to get rid of some things to simplify and fit it into 8 episodes. So, stop with your obsessions with the adaptations and try enjoying the show instead of whining like a 9 yr old. Try to be a little open-minded, if not then maybe you should just stick to your books 'cause I've rarely seen where the audience actually liked an adaptation of a show or a movie that's based on a book."	show great sci fi fan absolutely love probably one good sci fi show see cast could bite well story interest think provoke enough keep binge watch mind hater rat cause think loyal book base book every movie show loyal book could different alter version change deficiency book way detail need get rid thing simplify fit episode stop obsession adaptation try enjoy show instead whine like yr old try little open mind maybe stick book cause rarely see audience actually like adaptation show movie base book
2	Intellectually stimulating a great premise and wonderfully depicted. Made by the creators of Game of Thrones. Based on a book by Cixin Liu. A fresh take on the alien invasion story. All characters their own persona. Not very complicated like mostly suspense thrillers are. The story unwinds nicely. A good watch for someone who fancies being a scientist and likes space , mathematics. Friendship among them is depicted well. Good take on how villains are born after the experience injustice done to them in their own lives . Perfect series to binge watch overnight. Cannot wait for the next season to be released.	intellectually stimulate great premise wonderfully depict make creator game throne base book cixin liu fresh take alien invasion story character persona complicate like mostly suspense thriller story unwind nicely good watch someone fancy scientist like space mathematic friendship among depict well good take villain bear experience injustice do live perfect series binge watch overnight wait next season release
1	"Its a New view on the Fallout universe and in my opinion its good. If you love Bethesda latest releases ( FO4 and FO76) you will love, watch and rewatch this series....if you're more a Obsidian / Originals you'll surely have a more critical view but try to watch it for what it is - a New aproach on a beloved Universe and if you dont like the games and just want a post nuclear world like Mad Max or something with a more serious Tone, just avoid it at all costs - isnt for you, its for the Bethesda/Fallout game Fans.Its entertaining,fun to watch but with some debatable choices like choosing a more humorous aproach instead of the lore friendly one or the depiction of some characters( ghouls) or "" monsters/ creatutes"". It's generally filled with solid and sometimes good acting moments, what makes it good but Not great."	new view fallout universe opinion good love bethesda late release fo fo love watch rewatch series obsidian original surely critical view try watch new aproach beloved universe do not like game want post nuclear world like mad max something serious tone avoid cost be not bethesda fallout game fan entertain fun watch debatable choice like choose humorous aproach instead lore friendly one depiction character ghoul monster creatute generally fill solid sometimes good act moment make good great
0	This show is very slow and the narration is a little annoying, the characters aren't very interesting and it seems to always be based on the relationships. The whole 'choosing' gets really irritating....This is supposed to show how surgeons operate in the work place but seems to be a rip of an 'teenn soap'/ER.... The actors have no real talent, they seem to be playing themselves and the story lines are weak...the only positive thing is that the hype will probably see that this show has at least six or seven seasons on the air.Overall it is slow and dreary......	show slow narration little annoy character interest seem always base relationship whole choose get really irritate suppose show surgeon operate work place seem rip teenn soap er actor real talent seem play story line weak positive thing hype probably see show least six seven season air overall slow dreary
0	I was happy to invest time in this despite many concerns about implausible characters and settings, and for the first few episodes it kept my interest.But as time went on, the characters and settings just became more and more cartoon-like, and completely implausible situations and settings started to become the norm.The killer for me came when a room of 'supposed' scientists completely failed to spot a gigantic hole in one of the main scientific tenets (I won't spoil it for you, but just to say it's to do with accelerating masses and completely overlooking that the larger masses in question would also have to be accelerated way beyond our capability). This isn't a debate, it's just plain impossible. And therefore, none of what ensues in the supposed resolution is possible.And then there's the ridiculous scene in the hospital with the signing of the contract. What on earth (literally!) is the point of this? If the guy reneges on his contact it is too late and therefore has no value.And then there's the frequent telegraphing of what is going to happen, sometimes multiple episodes ahead.I'm really annoyed I invested time in this trash.	happy inv time despite many concern implausible character setting first episode keep interest time go character setting become cartoon like completely implausible situation setting start become norm killer come room suppose scientist completely fail spot gigantic hole one main scientific tenet spoil say accelerate mass completely overlook large mass question would also accelerate way beyond capability debate plain impossible therefore none ensue suppose resolution possible ridiculous scene hospital sign contract earth literally point guy renege contact late therefore value frequent telegraph go happen sometimes multiple episode ahead really annoy invest time trash
2	I just finished watching it from beginning to end. I played the PC game Fallout 4 but never finished it. The series at the other hand was very compelling for me at least. Only problem I can find as far as I can see is First Act introducing the world of Fallout although great , is a little bit long and tedious and might be turn over for casual viewer. Fallout starts with a nostalgic jittery aura of an alternate future with 1950'ies aesthatics when bombs begin to fall but then after centuries later we are introduced with a very naive and insular isolated society of vault dwellers living their lived not interracting with any surviving human communities at all ( or so ity seems) From then the story and conspiracy involving it unfolds with flashbacks to pre nuclear war era step by step.The writer Jonathan Nolan's reluctance and deep suspicion of corporate culture and wild free for all capitalism is all plain to see in it. ( there was something similar in his previous tv series Person of Interest and even Michael Emerson from that show guest starring in one episode here in Fallout)Ella Purnell as main heroine Lucy , Vault 33 dweller searching her father is quite a find for me and Aaron Muten as her co star Maximus Brother of Steel squire holds own his own. ( the building romance has a macabre humour in it) But as far as I concerned best performance was from Walton Goggins as Ghoul the Bounty Hunter and his previous Western Actor character before the nuclear war , Cooper Howard. Goggins was great in his dual role especially as badass and snarky Ghoul but I bet he had fun with pre war 1950'ies aestetics driving car or wearing fashion of that era.	finish watch begin end play pc game fallout never finish series hand compel least problem find far see first act introduce world fallout although great little bite long tedious might turn casual viewer fallout start nostalgic jittery aura alternate future ie aesthatic bomb begin fall century later introduce naive insular isolate society vault dweller live live interracting survive human community ity seem story conspiracy involve unfold flashback pre nuclear war era step step writer jonathan nolan reluctance deep suspicion corporate culture wild free capitalism plain see something similar previous tv series person interest even michael emerson show guest star one episode fallout ella purnell main heroine lucy vault dweller search father quite find aaron muten co star maximus brother steel squire hold build romance macabre humour far concern good performance walton goggin ghoul bounty hunter previous western actor character nuclear war cooper howard goggin great dual role especially badass snarky ghoul bet fun pre war ies aestetic drive car wear fashion era
1	"What the 1980 Version has the 2024 doesn't: * actually filmed in Japan * actual love story in the book * better themed music (tho action music wonky) * follows the book * has contrast of great sunlight vs rain * more screen time for crew & Christian enemies * paced, immersive bc it takes its timeBoth have many Japanese actors, nothing new in 2024 version. The 2024 guts the boom, ignores strong side arcs, some main characters don't have screen charisma. Being shot in British Columbia, it's almost always overcast, foggy, rainy. Very unlike Japan. They pushed ""authenticity"" and blew it with location, not following the boom, making up scenes not in the book like they knew better, it's a decent watch but overall total failure to bring passion, adventure, variety of entertainment the 1980 version slays at.The book is best of course.

0	The main problem with this rehash of the 2 Ripley classics is not the odd black and white decision (in colorful Italy!) It is the casting. Tom presents as a man in his 40s to 50s, much older than the part needs. He looks worn and weary with eye bags and receeding hairline. He huffs and puffs up those the stairs. There is little that is glamorous or sexy about him. This throws all of his relationships into disbelief -- especially with Dickie, his (supposed) contemporary and object of his desire.Homoeroticism is a core component of the vastly better first 2 films and novel. Alain Delon is perhaps the sexiest actor of his generation, with his icy blue eyes and criminal undercurrent. Matt Damon brought the perfect blend of preppy golden boy with master manipulator. Jude Law is the best Dickie, and Gwyneth Paltrow the best Marge. Both nail the breezy, upper class marks critical to the story. The rest of the cast in the Damon classic is equally superlative.The question then is, what were they thinking with this latest cast? Almost everyone is miscast. The casting decisions make this version dull and drab, without any of the spark of the two classics. The actors are all fine, they are just wrong for this rehash. It's like remaking Cat On A Hot Tin Roof without actors that can match the beauty and talent of Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman.Anyway, why even try to attempt a remake of a classic? The audience is better served by watching the 2 outstanding originals. (And they're shorter!) Don't waste your precious time.	main problem rehash ripley classic odd black white decision colorful italy cast tom present man much old part need look wear weary eye bag receeding hairline huff puff stair little glamorous sexy throw relationship disbelief especially dickie suppose contemporary object desire homoeroticism core component vastly well first film novel alain delon perhaps sexy actor generation icy blue eye criminal undercurrent matt damon bring perfect blend preppy golden boy master manipulator jude law good dickie gwyneth paltrow good marge nail breezy upper class mark critical story rest cast damon classic equally superlative question think late cast almost everyone miscast cast decision make version dull drab without spark two classic actor fine wrong rehash like remake cat hot tin roof without actor match beauty talent elizabeth taylor paul newman anyway even try attempt remake classic audience well serve watch outstanding original short waste precious time
2	This excellent period piece is set mostly in Italy over a six month period beginning in late 1960. About 10 minutes into part 6 there appears a receipt dated 11 January, 1961 for a one week car rental until 18 January, and in the very next scene is featured a Jaguar E-type, a.k.a the famous XKE, parked on the street.There are two temporal problems here. The Jaguar E-type didn't debut until March, 1961 at the Geneva Auto Show, after which very few cars were released for public sale. So, there can be no way for it to have appeared in Italy two months earlier. Still more problematic, the featured car is clearly from the 1970 model year.But for the temporal disconnect I would rate this series at 10/10. Incredible cinematography, writing, acting, directing ...	excellent period piece set mostly italy six month period begin late minute part appear receipt date january one week car rental january next scene feature jaguar e type k famous xke park street two temporal problem jaguar e type debut march geneva auto show car release public sale way appear italy two month early still problematic feature car clearly model year temporal disconnect would rate series incredible cinematography write act direct

They've got all kinds of nice stuff going on, beautiful delicious soft serve vanilla bean ice cream, some hot fudge, freshly cracked up peanuts, woah what is that?? A brownie? Some delicious house made whipped cream... Man this sundae is gonna be spectacular. Wow what more could you ask for? Cherry on top? Bring it on!!And then all of a sudden they put an anchovy on top, and then another, and then a couple more, and then squirt some Dijon mustard on for good measure.You don't even want the sundae anymore, in fact, you can't even look back on how nice that sundae used to be without thinking about all the stupid s*** they did at the very end just when it was going so well.That's essentially Game of Thrones. I tried to rewatch it, but as I got through the first season I began looking at where all the pieces land at the end it's literally impossible to go back to. There are just so many ruined character arcs, so much pointlessness, and every time I come back here I drop it one more star it seems like.

2	Really enjoying this show! It achieves a good balance of portraying both serious and everyday issues. I appreciate that the characters develop with the experiences they encounter--they grow and change and learn about themselves. The acting is excellent across the board. The presentation is engaging without being unnecessarily dark or twisted. There is an appropriate level of action, and a realistic interaction amongst the characters. The show keeps your attention, challenges the viewer to reflect on the greyness of policing, and delivers comic moments naturally.An area of improvement would be long-term continuity. For instance, a romantic relationship at the series beginning is tossed away as if the writers had second thoughts about that line. Ok, fine, but the characters then go on as if nothing ever happened. Another example is the role of the Captain. At first she is actively engaged with the team. After a dramatic development, the team no longer interacts with a Captain. To be entertaining, the show doesn't have to be realistic in regard to the actual LAPD procedures, but it should be consistent within its own fictitious world.	really enjoy show achieve good balance portray serious everyday issue appreciate character develop experience encounter grow change learn act excellent across board presentation engage without unnecessarily dark twist appropriate level action realistic interaction amongst character show keep attention challenge viewer reflect greyness police deliver comic moment naturally area improvement would long term continuity instance romantic relationship series begin toss away writer second thought line ok fine character go nothing ever happen another example role captain first actively engage team dramatic development team long interact captain entertain show realistic regard actual lapd procedure consistent within fictitious world
1	"A series with lots of strengths a solid performances. Sticks reasonably close to the source material, not too significantly dumbed diwn. It is however utterly let down by some simply shocking casting choices. Most damagingly, Eiza González does not appear in a scene without acting as tho in a photoshoot for a fashion magazine cover. In every shot, even ones where she is portrayed as just waking up after a night binge drinking, she has supermodel, 2 hours worth of make up. The other characters continually comment ""you are beautiful"" to her, and she strikes another pose.This shatters any willing suspicion of disbelief and spoils what otherwise would have been a decent series.Watch the Chinese version instead. Sorry."	series lot strength solid performance stick reasonably close source material significantly dumbe diwn however utterly let simply shock cast choice damagingly eiza gonz lez appear scene without act tho photoshoot fashion magazine cover every shoot even one portray wake night binge drink supermodel hour worth make character continually comment beautiful strike another pose shatter will suspicion disbelief spoil otherwise would decent series watch chinese version instead sorry
2	Well cast and written. Stellar performances from the core cast. Gets the tone and art style of the games almost perfect. Very good and watchable for fans and casuals alike. Some potential (but fixable with a season 2 or future game) game continuity problems, weird choice of arm rockets over the game beloved jet pack and slightly rough de-aging in one scene are the minor points that JUST hold the show back from perfection. Really does put almost all other video game adaptations to shame. If this level of quality is maintained, I really hope they make a season 2. 9/10 from both me (game fan) and my partner. (New to the franchise.)	well cast write stellar performance core cast get tone art style game almost perfect good watchable fan casual alike potential fixable season future game game continuity problem weird choice arm rocket game belove jet pack slightly rough de age one scene minor point hold show back perfection really put almost video game adaptation shame level quality maintain really hope make season game fan partner new franchise

I can barely watch Grey's, which I've invested over a decade in. I'm definitely not starting another show considering how awful this season is.Second, what happened to Miranda? This is a show that called Miranda ""The Nazi""! Now, it's trying so hard to act like America's social conscience that it turned an intelligent, strong, capable woman of color into a sniveling mess, who is practically incapable of performing in any leadership capacity? Also, have we milked the Meredith storyline enough yet? Apparently, Link & Amelia don't really even work at all anymore. They just stay home and watch Meredith's children.I tried fast forwarding through the overblown social preaching, but this week's episode left me with about 3 minutes.

And like its famous ""I don't give a da*&"" line, episode 2, will create the long lasting ""He was screwing my chickens"", which I'm sure will go down in movie history. Why no mention of Demolition Man in the other reviews. The female character is S. Bullock, ditzy, naive but has the chutzpah underneath. And the exosuits have been used 10 times b4.

0	"It's intrinsically a gripping story and in this version this kicks in after a long, long time, when Scott and Flynn finally go on the boat trip. After that, the plot kept me watching. However - and it's a big however - the script is flat and the acting flatter. Andrew Scott barely moves a facial muscle throughout. Whatever makes Ripley of any interest to Greenleaf? He's a total bore. There is no sign even so much as lively conversation between them. Johnny Flynn is equally bland. He affects a semi-growling monotone. Playboy glamour? Next to none. As has been noted elsewhere, they are both far, far too old for their parts - in Scott's case by about 20 years! A 27-year-old actor might have prsented us with a ""hungrier"" and at least livelier Ripley. A very strange feature of the plot near the end is that the American detective correctly works out (guesses?) what's what and asks the key question (which I won't give away here) but promptly drops it. Why? It's not the only puzzling and convenient feature of the plot, but I won't say more."	intrinsically grip story version kick long long time scott flynn finally go boat trip plot keep watch however big however script flat act flatter andrew scott barely move facial muscle throughout whatever make ripley interest greenleaf total bore sign even much lively conversation johnny flynn equally bland affect semi growl monotone playboy glamour next none note elsewhere far far old part scott case year year old actor might prsente we hungrier least lively ripley strange feature plot near end american detective correctly work guess ask key question give away promptly drop puzzle convenient feature plot say
2	"Remembrance of Earth's Past might be, if not my favorite book series, on the top three. When I've heard they were adapting it for Netflix, I was scared. When I've heard who was behind the project, I was even more scared. But, on the same time, I was... kind of hopeful? Sure, we had the Tecent adaptation... The news about the cast and and the teasers left me even more fearful.I did get hopeful from time to time, like when I heard they were calling the others ""San-Ti"" and now ""Treesolarians"", showing they went back to the original language books.I was right to be scared, and I was right to be hopeful.The adaptation if good, but good in a very different way the books are good.It is the same story (mostly), and they are being faithful to it (mostly). It can't compete with the books regarding the science, but it is good where the books are weak (character development).The casting works. Liam Cunningham is going a great job. Marlo Kelly is perfectly cast. Benedict Wong is spot on. Everyone else is going a competent job at the very least.The pacing is faster than the books but, then again, how could it not be. But not so fast that they don't take their time to show us the characters.Even having had the books and knowing the story, it is worth the watch.

0	As a woman and a non game fan I wouldn't recommend this show. It is made well but has nothing in it I want to see. It is essentially the game turned into a tv show... but that doesn't mean I will want to see any of it. Some examples from the first two shows... the main character, alleged to be a spoiled girl, essentially has sex with a raider (criminal) under false pretenses, has her father kidnapped, and her response... go out into the very scary world to get him back. Um... that is what a character in a game does... no girl has those reactions. Soon we are introduced to a character that has his foot taken clear off and dies from the bleeding and what does this girl do? Removes his head as he asked. Right, as you do? There is no humanity in this show, just game characters and thus no one to root for.	woman non game fan recommend show make well nothing want see essentially game turn tv show mean want see example first two show main character allege spoil girl essentially sex raider criminal false pretense father kidnap response go scary world get back um character game girl reaction soon introduce character foot take clear die bleed girl remove head ask right humanity show game character thus one root
2	What's great about Fallout is that you can go completely blind into it, not having played the video games, and you'll still understand everything and be immersed in the world and story being told. For those who've played the games, it's real treat seeing the world and all the lore-related things come to life on the tv screen. The set designs are impressive, the CGI is solid and the attention to detail is on point. This is a show that does justice to the games while also telling it's own unique story. If you've played the games, you can tell they did their research and really tried to emulate the style and feel of the world. The aesthetic, the look, the feel, the tone - they nailed it all. It felt very surreal to watch a video game world come to life in live action so seamlessly. The cinematography and lighting is top notch and definitely elevates the whole experience. The music, done by the same guy who did the music for Game of Thrones (Ramin Djawadi), did a great job with the score.Walton Goggins is iconic and amazing as The Ghoul. His character's arc was really interesting to watch. Ella Purnell did a fantastic job playing Lucy. Lucy is the definition of how you write a strong female character. Woke Hollywood can learn a few things from this show. Her charm, her humor and those big pretty eyes really sell it. Lucy's character development was one of the best. Seeing her go through her tough journey, growing as a person and character, while also discovering the truth, was insanely satisfying to watch. It's not only how you write an interesting and compelling female character lead, but it's also how you write any great character arc. Everyone's a beautifully flawed character and it works especially in the world of Fallout. We get to see how far someone is willing to go in order to get what they want.The storytelling is probably one of the most compelling and amazing things about the show. It reminded me a lot of the way Pulp Fiction is told. The way it jumps around to different characters' stories and the way it goes back and forth from the present to the past and back again. Really great storytelling going here. The acting is top notch, never once did it feel corny, lame or phony. The one thing that can be a bit over the top at times is the blood and violence. It can be quite brutal. But you gotta remember, this show is based on a game where getting a perfectly placed headshot on an enemy makes their head explode into a million fleshy pieces. And you also gotta remember the post apocalyptic messed up world in which it takes place in. A lot of times they use these super violent moments as a way of injecting a bit of dark humor - and it works. The humor in this show reflects the dark humor in the game.Overall, I was unexpectedly impressed and satisfied by Fallout. I went into it with no expectations hoping that it would be great and it turned out to be something amazing. It's an incredibly well-made and put together show that's worth watching regardless if you've played the games or not. Highly highly recommend it.	great fallout go completely blind play video game still understand everything immerse world story tell play game real treat see world lore relate thing come life tv screen set design impressive cgi solid attention detail point show justice game also tell unique story play game tell research really try emulate style feel world aesthetic look feel tone nail feel surreal watch video game world come life live action seamlessly cinematography light top notch definitely elevate whole experience music do guy music game throne ramin djawadi great job score walton goggin iconic amaze ghoul character arc really interest watch ella purnell fantastic job play lucy lucy definition write strong female character wake hollywood learn thing show charm humor big pretty eye really sell lucy character development one good see go tough journey grow person character also discover truth insanely satisfy watch write interest compel female character lead also write great character arc everyone beautifully flaw character work especially world fallout get see far someone will go order get want storytelle probably one compel amaze thing show remind lot way pulp fiction tell way jump around different character story way go back forth present past back really great storytelle go act top notch never feel corny lame phony one thing bite top time blood violence quite brutal get ta remember show base game get perfectly place headshot enemy make head explode million fleshy piece also get ta remember post apocalyptic mess world take place lot time use super violent moment way inject bite dark humor work humor show reflect dark humor game overall unexpectedly impress satisfy fallout go expectation hop would great turn something amaze incredibly well make put together show worth watch regardless play game highly highly recommend
1	"The pilot way heavy on the cliches & stereotypes (""he's old"" joke every 2 minutes, sometimes less). It's a recurring motif throw out the series. ABC played it safe casting Fillion as lead, if you are a Fillion fan you will most likely be watching. I was never a fan of his, so his presents it somewhat distracting, it would have been more entertaining to see a fresh face, an unknown actor in 40-50's for this. But here is the weird part: Fillion fans don't like it because he ""deserved better"" (come on people, he can't play the 35-ish charmer anymore) and as far as I concern- it's a decent casting for his age (being playful with the age issue). BUT- Fillion looks bloated. Too much nip and tucked, yes, Fillion is skinny again (he got fatter as Castle progressed) but looks bad.The show itself has decent action scenes but many plot holes or unbelievable things in it. There isn't much currently on TV that I like (The rookie comes on ABC's Forever time slot- now that was an unjustified cancellation!), this show is O.K-ish. Will I be watching an episode every week? no.

I don't know what to think or feel after watching this, mainly some sadness and empathy for him or others going through similar things, I can't imagine how much something like that can take over your life but this shows it fairly well... and the process on how to get help, if you can from like police, or how to mentally deal with it, is complicated to say the least."	wow literally binge one sit sure expect many thing go theme topic feel intense show likely hit hard base true story tell person experience many other say main character make bad decision watch cause human we human know think feel watch mainly sadness empathy other go similar thing imagine much something like take life show fairly well process get help like police mentally deal complicate say least
2	If you thought this was about reindeer, you will be sorely mistaken. It's just a nickname given by the stalker to our protagonist. It will make sense, eventually. Although nothing else does.This was powerful. I found myself, as a woman who has had abusers and stalkers, very triggered in some parts. It flips the script on what is usually spoken about and shows us another side which doesn't get the same attention. Men can be victims too. Women can be harmful. Men are not automatically protected from other men.It rattled me to the core with familiarity; The way his friends joked about it, and encouraged it The way the police blew him off The way he was accused of leading her on The way his kindness was misread as attraction The way she managed to physically overcome him to cop a feel The way he was ignored while clearly expressing 'no' The way someone you trust can turn on you in an instant if they have a chance at you with lowered inhibitions, You'll not find a woman who has not had at least one of these things happen to her. I love that it's in the spotlight as happening to men, I don't wish to take away from that, let's just hear that same outrage for women.If you can get past that angst, it's pretty cooked. Worth the watch, but be prepared to be uncomfortable.	think reindeer sorely mistake nickname give stalker protagonist make sense eventually although nothing else powerful find woman abuser stalker trigger part flip script usually speak show we another side get attention man victim woman harmful man automatically protect man rattle core familiarity way friend joke encourage way police blow way accuse lead way kindness misread attraction way manage physically overcome cop feel way ignore clearly express way someone trust turn instant chance low inhibition find woman least one thing happen love spotlight happen man wish take away let hear outrage woman get past angst pretty cook worth watch prepare uncomfortable

1	After third episode Ive become very disappointed they cut out so much Blackthrone saving Toranaga was given small shift they didn't ever go into Blackthorne visiting the black ship and getting saved by the other pilot Why did they cut these out or charge the story. The 1989 Broadcast version followed the book better then this. I guess for a new generation but I would suggest watching the original tv showBy the same I mean its staying pretty clear to the 80's mini-series. You have to understand at the time this was not a normal tv thing. And the amount of sex and violence was big for the time at Primetime network. I like this version ok except for two main things. The music....is awful everyone should be fired from the music department. And whoever graded the color of the film and look its to dark to much at beginning I wish spend more time at the first couple days and how important his time in prison was especially as they have time to add this stuff bug guessing there keeping it for the big battles at the end.	third episode I ve become disappoint cut much blackthrone save toranaga give small shift ever go blackthorne visit black ship get save pilot cut charge story broadcast version follow book well guess new generation would suggest watch original tv showby mean stay pretty clear mini series understand time normal tv thing amount sex violence big time primetime network like version ok except two main thing music awful everyone fire music department whoever grade color film look dark much begin wish spend time first couple day important time prison especially time add stuff bug guess keep big battle end

I went back to it during lockdown because I felt like i had watched every tv show ever made. Nothing had changed really, still the same ridiculous storylines but now with added new characters that made me want to punch myself in the face. This sister house story is creepy and so unbelievable that the writers and producers must be wetting themselves that people are still wanting to watch it and for it to continue. It's about time they put the world and show out of its misery and end it.	stop watch year ago storyline beyond ridiculous feel like force world go back lockdown feel like watch every tv show ever make nothing change really still ridiculous storyline add new character make want punch face sister house story creepy unbelievable writer producer must wet people still want watch continue time put world show misery end

The story of the series continued beautifully and the characters were in their right place. The only point I had until this moment was why there was no more news about the crew of the ship and what fate has been decided for them until this moment?Using the Japanese language and showing the Japanese people with their own language and culture was another positive point that I was interested in.I hope that we will witness an attractive and stunning ending.	think face first two bore episode finish two episode realize nail grind long time go watch attractive shock series story series continue beautifully character right place point moment news crew ship fate decide moment use japanese language show japanese people language culture another positive point interest hope witness attractive stun end

The whole story is noir so contrasting with fabulous colours of Italy would have been good counterpoint. The B&W made it all rather drab.I thought the characterisations could have been more engaging.I thought the best player was the Postmaster. He actually seemed more sinister than Ripley.Dickie is living the most wonderful life in Italy with a beautiful woman in his bed and yet he seems so disengaged from everything.If you don't mind spending 8 hours of your life watching a slow B&W movie where you already know the plot..go ahead. I wish I could give it more stars.	love episode sure want revisit remain hour summary like black white whole story noir contrast fabulous colour italy would good counterpoint b w make rather drab think characterisation could engage think good player postmaster actually seem sinister ripley dickie live wonderful life italy beautiful woman bed yet seem disengage everything mind spend hour life watch slow b w movie already know plot go ahead wish could give star

Stop trying to revive the first Grey's residents. Let the newbies have their own personalities instead of trying to be like the OGs. You have written them to be so self absorbed and whiny. Trying way too hard. So unbelievable. Who is writing these scripts. Also, what happened to Amelia's love interest? Altman? Let Winston move on and find a better love interest who is smart, compassionate, and a Dan good surgeon who accepts him for who he is...And April and Jackson...bring them back.	either write maggie strong less self absorb character write self absorb whiny year also new resident script stop try revive first grey resident let newbie personality instead try like og write self absorb whiny try way hard unbelievable write script also happen amelia love interest altman let winston move find well love interest smart compassionate dan good surgeon accept april jackson bring back
0	I've just had it with poor renditions of Sci-fi. Fallout is no different. It starts with promise, but unlike Silo it gets bogged down in constant technological and relationship distraction designed to keep your attention, much like The Walking Dead. It even borrows the mysterious Ed Harris character played by Walt Goggins from Westworld. But ultimately it's a story about a young woman's quest to rescue her father and the trials and tribulations she encounters along the way. The characters are uninteresting and contribute little to furthering the narrative with the exception of Walt Goggins. The sweet melodies of yesteryear soundtrack, a la Nat King Cole, The Ink Spots and Bing Crosby make little sense played to the vicious war scenes with Real Steel like robots and a ghoul. It's just so unsatisfying. But what do you expect when a production is based on a video game?Further: it checks all the Hollywood PC demands that are now standard policy or productions will not get made. This is the world we now live it. The actors' ethnicities and so on take precedent over writing, acting ability, and story telling. Meritocracy criteria for character choice is a thing of the past...	poor rendition sci fi fallout different start promise unlike silo get bogge constant technological relationship distraction design keep attention much like walk dead even borrow mysterious ed harris character play walt goggin westworld ultimately story young woman quest rescue father trial tribulation encounter along way character uninteresting contribute little further narrative exception walt goggin sweet melody yesteryear soundtrack la nat king cole ink spot bing crosby make little sense play vicious war scene real steel like robot ghoul unsatisfying expect production base video game check hollywood pc demand standard policy production get make world live actor ethnicity take precedent write act ability story tell meritocracy criterion character choice thing past
1	You have to know it would be an adaptation and not entirely faithful to the book. After all, it has to have contemporary woke elements, like gender and race-swapped characters, millennials pretending to be experts, and diverse casting for a story that originally has almost all Chinese characters. And since there aren't enough key characters for Benioff and Weis, a bunch has to be created to weave more complicated character arcs.Once you choke down the initial nausea and stick with it for a couple of episodes, the main story straightens out and stays mostly on track. The China-based flashbacks that tell Ye Wenjie's story that triggers the course of events are reasonably true to source and done well, even as the London-based invented mess meanders, while Benedict Wong's character and performance is initially buried and wasted.The VR simulated world of Three Body is very well done, high budget, and it shows. By the third episode, the show begins to take better shape and redeems itself, and, at least for me, allowed me to assimilate the changes that were made to the source, and becomes watchable. I might even be able to start a drinking game to call out actors brought over from GoT.Having previously watched Tencent's 30-episode adaptation (that's far more faithful to the book), I almost would have wished that version had the same budget and treatment. But for what it is, this appears to be a quality production worth watching.	know would adaptation entirely faithful book contemporary wake element like gender race swap character millennial pretend expert diverse cast story originally almost chinese character since enough key character benioff weis bunch create weave complicate character arc choke initial nausea stick couple episode main story straighten stay mostly track china base flashback tell ye wenjie story trigger course event reasonably true source do well even london base invent mess meand benedict wong character performance initially bury waste vr simulate world three body well do high budget show third episode show begin take well shape redeem least allow assimilate change make source become watchable might even able start drink game call actor bring get previously watch tencent episode adaptation far faithful book almost would wish version budget treatment appear quality production worth watch

I wanted to shake Donny. Why would anyone allow this to go on. Then I saw episode 4. This show is not for the faint hearted. It will make you feel very Uneasy. The story being told is written and happened to the main actor. Real bravery to put this out there in a series like this. Great acting.( character limit filler here) I watched episode 4 as a download on a plane and I didn't notice we had landed for a good 5 minutes was my shock about what I had just watched.	quit show watch episode get annoy donny allow martha get away much call police tell f want shake donny would anyone allow go see episode show faint hearted make feel uneasy story tell write happen main actor real bravery put series like great act character limit filler watch episode download plane notice land good minute shock watch
0	"The first two episodes were promising but then it starts to fall apart. Too many unnecessary subplots, graphic violence and sex. Might as well be another Game of Thrones.For example in episode 6, there is war on the horizon between Lord Toranaga (Sanada) and the council led primarily by Lord Ishido (Hira) but the focus here is on the negotiation of the price for the courtesan Kiku (Kouri) to spend a night with Blackthorne (Jarvis) in what is supposedly a seductive scene hence the title of the episode ""Ladies of the Willow World."" This happens after a major earthquake; Mariko's (Sawai) flashbacks; Lady Ochiba No Kata (Nikaido) plotting war - which are all glazed over subplots. The Noh theatre scene even has more screen time than the major storyline.If it's not for Sanada, I would have stopped watching, even he seems bored. Another critic who read the book and watched the original 80's series commented that the writers must have skimped over the pages or didn't bother reading it altogether. This lack of research shows in the way the characters behave and talk as if they're in the 20th Century, not feudal Japan.The characters are under developed, no chemistry between Mariko and Blackthorne. The Portuguese priests are sidelined when they are crucial to the story. Half way through, we're now learning of the link between Mariko and Ochiba and the latter's vengeance for Toranaga. The editing slices and dice up the scenes which makes the story confusing to follow. With four episodes to go, I'm not having high hopes. Such a wasted opportunity, could have been a standout series based on a best selling book or the Japanese history which should have provided a lot of material to get inspiration from. But alas, it's the 21st Century and it's all about instant gratification, lazy writing where truth doesn't matter anymore."	first two episode promise start fall apart many unnecessary subplot graphic violence sex might well another game throne example episode war horizon lord toranaga sanada council lead primarily lord ishido hira focus negotiation price courtesan kiku kouri spend night blackthorne jarvis supposedly seductive scene hence title episode lady willow world happen major earthquake mariko sawai flashback lady ochiba kata nikaido plot war glaze subplot noh theatre scene even screen time major storyline sanada would stop watch even seem bore another critic read book watch original series comment writer must skimp page bother read altogether lack research show way character behave talk th century feudal japan character develop chemistry mariko blackthorne portuguese priest sideline crucial story half way learn link mariko ochiba latter vengeance toranaga edit slice dice scene make story confuse follow four episode go high hop waste opportunity could standout series base good sell book japanese history provide lot material get inspiration alas st century instant gratification lazy write truth matter anymore

That episode was more like Eastenders than a cop show. And looking at the next episode, predictably, it's more of the same.I'm used to these topic shows eventually turning into soaps but the writing and story here is so bad it's criminal itself.5 mins of a very poor cop show at the end and 40 mins of slapstick poorly scripted clowning around. A bad mix of very predictable concepts with the unbelievable.This show is done, bin it. It's lost it's way, to many poor relationship side stories which now domination and repeat time and again. And why does this firefighter girlfriend have be in every episode not doing every job of the medical to chemical spills.

1	I did watch this in one day and I was thinking throughout that it was a differerent and interesting story but many things did not make sense. I don't want to believe that this was based on a true story because of these disturbing things like, why didn't Donn talk to a therapist? Why didn't the police take more action given the fact they had a convicted person who had started doing the same actions for the ones she was convicted for? Why didn't Donn report his rapist? Why didn't Teri herself go to the police and report her beating from Martha? Why didn't Donn or his parents get the advise of a lawyer on how to act? And what was with the ending, him going to his rapist and accepting a job by him? I mean, it's a story out of the ordinary but it still doesn't make any sense. No person in 2024 should act like this. Or I hope that to be the case...	watch one day think throughout differerent interest story many thing make sense want believe base true story disturb thing like donn talk therapist police take action give fact convict person start action one convict donn report rapist teri go police report beat martha donn parent get advise lawyer act end go rapist accept job mean story ordinary still make sense person act like hope case

2	"At first I was skeptical of ""Grey's Anatomy"" and was hesitant to start watching the series. After all, the show had originally aired a full eleven seasons ago so why should I just pick it up now? This question was quickly answered the moment I clicked play. It is no wonder why the series continues to be such a hit well into its years of its original air-date. ""Grey's Anatomy"" pilots its series with a group of medical interns who befriend each other at Seattle Grace Hospital in Washington. The main character, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), seems to have some inner-confliction and constantly trying to please her mother, who is an acclaimed ex-doctor and the equivalent to Beyoncé in the medicine world. Meredith immediately clicks with hard-core, overachieving, aspiring surgeon Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh). Soon after, lovable George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) and optimistic Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) move into Meredith's childhood home as her roommates. The formulating group also includes Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), who doesn't seem all too happy to be there but somehow always sticks around. All the while, relationships begin to take shape amongst the interns and attendees, the first being between Meredith and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), who is also known as ""McSteamy"" throughout the hospital.The acting is great and proves to have very little to complain about. Oh hits the nail right on the head as she portrays Cristina as perfectly unpleasant at times but somehow you still want to be her best friend. Knight as George O'Malley depicts the character's struggle with his vulnerability exceptionally and Chambers makes you love and hate him all at the same time, which is precisely what makes Alex such a stick-out character. While the vast majority of acting is phenomenal, sometimes the story lines and characters are not up to par. Pompeo is charming and adorable but Meredith is increasingly frustrating, it seems the writers are constantly hitting her character with waves of bad luck (I'll refrain from spoiling anything). Consequently, every time Pompeo's lip quivers and tears begin to well up you can't help but think, ""Again?"" Since the series focuses on different patients and different cases every episode, it is easy just to jump to a random episode and have a general understanding of what is going on. This is convenient for a viewer who may not want to start from the beginning but over time, it becomes impersonal. While the sexual relations and friendships carry through from episode to episode, the constantly changing dynamics within Seattle Grace makes for an inconsistent flow throughout. This may not bother someone who is watching one episode a week. Their thoughts and feelings that were aroused during the last episode are separated from this week's episode by a full seven days. While for the most recent flood of ""Grey's"" junkies, this variation in tone is somewhat aggravating while watching episodes back-to-back. For instance, one episode may focus on a patient that is fighting a tragic terminal illness and the next episode focuses more on the personal lives of the doctors, making it more light hearted. Though the touches of comic relief and knowing the characters' personal lives like the back of our hands adds cushion to some sensitive subjects, ""Grey's Anatomy"" is a true drama. As the episodes pile up, so does the tension. There may be some technical flaws here and there. Being an intern in a hospital is not that glamorous or as eventful as many doctors to attest to. Most interns barely get to scrub in on surgeries while Meredith and her colleagues cut someone's chest open practically every other day. ""Grey's Anatomy"" actually made me consider being a surgeon is not all that bad, only for a split-second though. Another minor flaw, it seems unlikely that that many good looking people would all be in acquaintance and work within the same establishment. But hey, it's television. Despite its minor faults, ""Grey's Anatomy"" was not worth my skepticism but definitely worth my time, no matter how many hours I spend binge watching on Netflix. It's a perfect guilty- pleasure show due to its outstanding addictive abilities and its lack of realistic situations, plus its unfathomably attractive cast. From any perspective, the series is a sure crowd-pleaser with just the right amount surgery and sex."	first skeptical grey anatomy hesitant start watch series show originally air full eleven season ago pick question quickly answer moment click play wonder series continue hit well year original air date grey anatomy pilot series group medical intern befriend seattle grace hospital washington main character meredith grey ellen pompeo seem inner confliction constantly try please mother acclaim ex doctor equivalent beyonc medicine world meredith immediately click hard core overachieve aspire surgeon cristina yang sandra oh soon lovable george malley r knight optimistic izzie stevens katherine heigl move meredith childhood home roommate formulate group also include alex karev justin chamber seem happy somehow always stick around relationship begin take shape amongst intern attendee first meredith derek shepherd patrick dempsey also know mcsteamy throughout hospital act great prove little complain oh hit nail right head portray cristina perfectly unpleasant time somehow still want good friend knight george malley depict character struggle vulnerability exceptionally chamber make love hate time precisely make alex stick character vast majority act phenomenal sometimes story line character par pompeo charm adorable meredith increasingly frustrate seem writer constantly hit character wave bad luck refrain spoil anything consequently every time pompeo lip quiver tear begin well help think since series focus different patient different case every episode easy jump random episode general understand go convenient viewer may want start begin time become impersonal sexual relation friendship carry episode episode constantly change dynamic within seattle grace make inconsistent flow throughout may bother someone watch one episode week thought feel arouse last episode separate week episode full seven day recent flood grey junkie variation tone somewhat aggravate watch episode back back instance one episode may focus patient fight tragic terminal illness next episode focus personal live doctor make light hearted though touch comic relief know character personal live like back hand add cushion sensitive subject grey anatomy true drama episode pile tension may technical flaw intern hospital glamorous eventful many doctor attest intern barely get scrub surgery meredith colleague cut someone chest open practically every day grey anatomy actually make consider surgeon bad split second though another minor flaw seem unlikely many good look people would acquaintance work within establishment hey television despite minor fault grey anatomy worth skepticism definitely worth time matter many hour spend binge watch netflix perfect guilty pleasure show due outstanding addictive ability lack realistic situation plus unfathomably attractive cast perspective series sure crowd pleaser right amount surgery sex

1	"Netflix's adaptation has turned into a quintessential American TV series. Tired of the typical ""bookish"" genre, I was initially delighted by the change, only to find it to be just another mediocre American show. In this series, the character Zhi Zi resembles a supercomputer, capable of enveloping the entire Earth. However, in reality, Zhi Zi disrupts astronomical/physical observational phenomena, instilling a deeper fear in scientists-the fear of the unknown energy rather than the fear of established scientific prowess.This portrayal not only showcases the fear of the unknown but also highlights the unsettling notion that our understanding of the universe may be fragile in the face of such disruptive forces. It challenges the very fabric of our scientific certainty, plunging characters and viewers alike into a realm of existential dread."	netflix adaptation turn quintessential american tv series tire typical bookish genre initially delight change find another mediocre american show series character zhi zi resemble supercomputer capable envelop entire earth however reality zhi zi disrupt astronomical physical observational phenomena instill deep fear scientist fear unknown energy rather fear establish scientific prowess portrayal showcase fear unknown also highlight unsettle notion understand universe may fragile face disruptive force challenge fabric scientific certainty plunge character viewer alike realm existential dread

I rewatched all of it and finally having watched the latest episodes I've got to say that I'm surprised. Yes, there are a lot of new characters but it seems like a new beginning since Meredith is gone now. I love that Owen, Teddy, Link, Bailey and Webber are still there. I live for that drama and this show is a good example of good story telling. It's got it all. Not to mention the music. The choice of songs is incredible. And I'm rooting for Dr. Skywalker.

1	The entire series is very well written, casted , acted and produced , BUT .....I'm afraid virtually everything that happens to this guy throughout the entire series he pretty much bought on himself.Any normal sensible person could see what was going to happen from the very beginning and would have run a mile.Both sick abnormal individuals that he got involved with were clearly red lighted at the very start of his meeting them ..... but he still chose to continue on multiple occasions.I still sympathise with what ultimately happened to him, but how stupid was he?!?Silly .... SILLY man 😔 😟The entire series would have been so much more effective if he was a totally innocent person who did nothing wrong and yet this had all still happened to him.With 100% sympathy for the victim this would have been an awesome series.	entire series well write cast act produce afraid virtually everything happen guy throughout entire series pretty much buy normal sensible person could see go happen begin would run mile sick abnormal individual get involve clearly red light start meet still choose continue multiple occasion still sympathise ultimately happen stupid silly silly man entire series would much effective totally innocent person nothing wrong yet still happen sympathy victim would awesome series
2	I enjoyed this tremendously and look forward to the next season. I have read the book and loved it, and have been concerned that it would be very hard to put on screen, especially in 8 episodes. But they did a great job. There are many changes from the book. The show is centered in London. Some characters have been westernized and there is more relationship drama. Some plot points have been dropped and others added. These changes are reasonable, though some worked and some didn't. Overall though excellent job. I do think it will be hard to understand a lot of things without reading the book but not impossible if you pay attention.Benedict Wong is excellent as are John Bradley, Zine Tseng, Liam Cunningham, Alex Sharp and Jess HongMy criticisms are: the Auggie character is poorly written. Eiza Gonzalez is very bad in the role and grating. She almost ruins the show. The motivations of the cult people are not well explained.

2	I love Grey, I really do, Grey has been through my whole teenage life, this show is part of me. But i have to say that after season 12, everything seems so messy. I don't know why, maybe it's because they tried to get Meredith into a new relationship or they kicked off great characters like Calie, Arizona and April, this show is just not the same now. The latest episode that I really love is Mama Tried and that's season 12. Season 13 is a total mess and has no storyline. Season 14 focuses on Owen and Amelia. (The only episode I loved from that season is Personal Jesus) And now season 15 is all about Jo. I guess I just miss the old school Grey.	love grey really grey whole teenage life show part say season everything seem messy know maybe try get meredith new relationship kick great character like calie arizona april show late episode really love mama try season season total mess storyline season focus owen amelia episode love season personal jesus season jo guess miss old school grey
2	"Earlier today I finished watching an eight-episode series Ripley (Netflix, 2024). Did it in just two sittings. All eight hours of it. A testament to one of two things: (1) an engrossing storyline; or (2) I don't get out much. In fairness, it's probably a bit of both.On a personal note, all three screen adaptations of the 1955 crime thriller novel by Patricia Highsmith, The Talented Mr. Ripley, involved the actors I simply adore; hence my interest in the piece:1. Plein soleil (Purple Moon), filmed in 1960, starring Alain Delon (his big-screen debut);2. The Talented Mr. Ripley, released in 1999, starring Jude Law alongside Matt Damon; and3. Ripley, dropped by Netflix several days ago, starring Dakota Fanning in what seems like her first adult role (although she was more impactful as a child actor).In all three ""incarnations"" the set-up is quite similar. The victim - Dickie - a rich 20-something American expat has lost any zest for life and is trying to rediscover himself by getting immersed in the Italian culture, painting, architecture, language, etc., as stimuli of sorts. The villain - Tom - does not come from money and clearly does not belong in Dickie's circles. But his persistence, cunning, and staunch desire to attain this craved class transition make him more of a protagonist, rather than the villain.The 2024 version was filmed entirely in Italy (including Naples, Rome, Palermo, San Remo, and Venice) and features some of the greatest songs of the era, including the classic Il Cielo In Una Stanza by Mina (when in a couple of hundred years they introduce a university course on the anthology of European 20th-century pop ballads, this would be the reference song. It would also appear that the producers working on this recording had just discovered the reverb effect and clearly went to town with it. But the song is still lovely).8 out of 10 (9, if you like Caravaggio; 9.5, if you like both Caravaggio and Mina)."	early today finish watch eight episode series ripley netflix two sitting eight hour testament one two thing engross storyline get much fairness probably bite personal note three screen adaptation crime thriller novel patricia highsmith talented mr ripley involve actor simply adore hence interest piece plein soleil purple moon film star alain delon big screen debut talente mr ripley release star jude law alongside matt damon ripley drop netflix several day ago star dakota fan seem like first adult role although impactful child actor three incarnation set quite similar victim dickie rich something american expat lose zest life try rediscover get immerse italian culture paint architecture language etc stimulus sort villain tom come money clearly belong dickie circle persistence cunne staunch desire attain crave class transition make protagonist rather villain version film entirely italy include naples rome palermo san remo venice feature great song era include classic il cielo una stanza mina couple hundred year introduce university course anthology european th century pop ballad would reference song would also appear producer work record discover reverb effect clearly go town song still lovely like caravaggio like caravaggio mina

2	I simply love this show. I love the fact that it takes place in my hometown of Seattle, Washington. Beautiful city with lots of places to see and do. I love the drama and all the actors and actresses as well as the writers. They keep me begging for more and more insight into their personal lifes. If i were only 30 years younger this show would inspire me to go into being a surgeon. There are plenty of role models on here and I hope the writer keeps up the good work with developing the characters. From Meredith to Derek; to Bailey and Chief and Owen and Christina; and now the drama with April and Jackson weddings galore and Callie and Arizona are my favorite couple on the show. You just can't help but tune in to see what happens every Thursday night. There is plenty of wrecking balls for everyone. You'll just have to tune in to see it for yourself. Warning though this show Grey's Anatomy does have a tendency to become addicting -- you'll love every minute of it. Here's to Shonda Rhimes and her pick of wonderful, colorful, and dynamic acting from a diverse group of stars!	simply love show love fact take place hometown seattle washington beautiful city lot place see love drama actor actress well writer keep beg insight personal life year young show would inspire go surgeon plenty role model hope writer keep good work develop character meredith derek bailey chief owen christina drama april jackson weddings galore callie arizona favorite couple show help tune see happen every thursday night plenty wreck ball everyone tune see warn though show grey anatomy tendency become addict love every minute shonda rhime pick wonderful colorful dynamic act diverse group star

1	"...before watching this series. I admit, I have read the book and therefore have a preconcieved opinion. The parts that is about the chinese in the 60s is pretty accurate and follows the heart of the book, but the other things is heavily massacred with so called ""inclusion"" (that usually is written in the contracts before anyone can make anything) that pretty much always breaks immersion on everything where it appears.I think I could live with that sign of the times if I hadnt read the book since that policy is implemented in everything nowadays. The book concentrates on the story, not to please people on what once was twitter.Thank god Benidoff and Weiss didnt have to bow for that ""propaganda"" when they created Game of Thrones.

1	This show started slow, but it grew on you. Throughout the series you get invested in the story, and have some explosive (literally) moments that are thrilling! These big moments were unexpected so it was a treat every time they occurred. As the show headed towards season 7, you can tell the directing got a tad lazy, but it was still fun to watch. Then season 8 happened. Cinematography? Great. Story? Meh. There are some moments that have you confused. For example: Dany forgot about Euron's fleet? Grey worm teleports to where Dany is? The castle falls on Jamie and Cersei, which kills them, yet Tyrion can walk to their bodies? The lighting of the long night? Ultimately, Game of Thrones is still a fantastic show. It is a shame that the final season only had six episodes, and was rushed.	show start slow grow throughout series get invest story explosive literally moment thrill big moment unexpected treat every time occur show head towards season tell direct get tad lazy still fun watch season happen cinematography great story meh moment confuse example dany forget euron fleet grey worm teleport dany castle fall jamie cersei kill yet tyrion walk body light long night ultimately game throne still fantastic show shame final season six episode rush
1	"The Three-Body Problem is one of my favorite sci-fi novels. I first read the trilogy 11 years ago during middle school, and it left me so shocked that I couldn't sleep at night. Over the years, there have been many adaptations of this novel, all of which have been controversial and somewhat disappointing in various aspects. Because of this, I had high hopes for Netflix's adaptation. Unfortunately, after watching the series this weekend on a trip, I can only say that my feelings are mixed, but I still recommend it.It's difficult to regard Netflix's ""3 Body Problem"" as the same entity as the novel, just as it's hard to consider Apple's version of ""Foundation"" as ""The Foundation Series."" If you're expecting something on the level of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, you're likely to find that it feels more like ""The Rings of Power"" instead. With a shell and some settings from the book, it drastically simplifies technology, logic, characters, and even the sociology and anthropology of power, individuals, and societies, opting instead for a timeless love story.From the perspective of the original work, I am greatly disappointed. However, when I think about it, it is, after all, a Netflix sci-fi series with good visual effects (in some parts), a tight plot, and innovative settings from ""The Three-Body Problem."" It's accessible for the average viewer and not bad by any means. If you haven't read the original book, this series will definitely be very interesting, and I hope it might inspire some interest in reading the original.I'm not a purist for the original work and I believe that adaptations should differ from the novel, but how to make these choices and how to present the essence of the novel in a different form is a question Denis Villeneuve answered in a unique way through what he left unsaid, but not what Benioff and Weiss has done in oversimplifying the plots and relationships."	three body problem one favorite sci fi novel first read trilogy year ago middle school leave shock sleep night year many adaptation novel controversial somewhat disappoint various aspect high hop netflix adaptation unfortunately watch series weekend trip say feel mix still recommend difficult regard netflix body problem entity novel hard consider apple version foundation foundation series expect something level lord ring trilogy likely find feel like ring power instead shell setting book drastically simplify technology logic character even sociology anthropology power individual society opt instead timeless love story perspective original work greatly disappoint however think netflix sci fi series good visual effect part tight plot innovative setting three body problem accessible average view bad mean read original book series definitely interest hope might inspire interest read original purist original work believe adaptation differ novel make choice present essence novel different form question denis villeneuve answer unique way leave unsay benioff weiss do oversimplify plot relationship
0	My advice: first read the books and we'll see if you give it more than 4 stars. I don't think so... This is one of the best fantasy saga I've ever read. Can't say that about series - sorry. It's shallow and boring with no attention to the details, plain and simple. Nudity & gore is not enough to keep mature audience entertained. It's good for teenagers though. If you're true fan of the books - stay out of it! If you haven't read the books yet - do it now and learn the difference. I truly wanted this to be a great series, but it's not. Period. Saying it's true masterpiece and the best series of all times is just ludicrous and immature, unless you have no expectations at all.	advice first read book see give star think one good fantasy saga ever read say series sorry shallow bore attention detail plain simple nudity gore enough keep mature audience entertain good teenager though true fan book stay read book yet learn difference truly want great series period say true masterpiece good series time ludicrous immature unless expectation

2	"Don't listen to the fanboy gatekeepers. This show wasn't perfect but it was awesome, and i expected far worse.Anybody with a brain knows it takes more than 1-2 episodes to have character development. Main character was likable, without being overpowered. Her luck stats were just high.She wasn't a Mary sue. She was the main character, the ""player character."" She starts off in basically a brainwashing cult, of course she's going to be naive. She grows and becomes more real. And remember it's only the first season, it takes time for people to change and break old habits.And god forbid a female actually have a sexual side without being criticized for it. I don't think it was necessary, but it was hardly interfering with the plot. I wasn't a fan of the romance aspect. But that's fine.That being said, max was awful. I kept rooting for him to die. I don't want redemption. They started his characters development far too late, and he's a psychopath.And of course everybody's favorite, Cooper. I could watch a whole show that just follows him around. He was such a fun morally gray character who was an over the top badass in the best ways. And I can't wait to see what they have in store for him. Give me the 200 years of backstory in a spinoff please.Lots of fun little Easter eggs and nods to the show, and actually having Matt berry show up was amazing."	listen fanboy gatekeeper show perfect awesome expect far bad anybody brain know take episode character development main character likable without overpower luck stat high mary sue main character player character start basically brainwash cult course go naive grow become real remember first season take time people change break old habit god forbid female actually sexual side without criticize think necessary hardly interfere plot fan romance aspect fine say max awful keep root die want redemption start character development far late psychopath course everybody favorite cooper could watch whole show follow around fun morally gray character top badass good way wait see store give year backstory spinoff please lot fun little easter egg nod show actually matt berry show amaze
1	I think this version of the Ripley story is more faithful to the book, but there is a lot in this series that simply copies the Anthony Minghella film from 1999. The way some of the scenes are shot are direct copies from the earlier film. The stairway view during the murder of Freddie, for example.Before I started watching the series, I had some major reservations about it from the trailer. I thought Tom and Dickie were too old for their characters, and I thought the black and white seemed too film school affectation. Black & White equals deep and thoughtful. Got it. I more or less was able to put both of these doubts behind me as I started watching, but I can't help but think that the series could have been better in color and with young lead actors.Why would Dickie's father care what his middle-aged son was up to? That ship has sailed, to put it politely.What is with the director and stairs? For a good portion of the series, we're forced to watch people walk up and down stairs. Elevators aren't working, porters can't be found, and so we go up and down and up and down. I'm sure there is symbolism in all this, but I don't care to figure it out as I'm too exhausted. As far as the photography, it mostly gets in the way instead of telling the story. It's too much like being forced to watch your neighbor's vacation slides.And how much of this series was spent showing Tom walking around? Walking up and down stairs? Being scrutinized by a hotel clerk? Answer: way too much.The sparse use of story made eight episodes unnecessary.Tom and the inspector were good, but none of the other actors took command of their roles. Freddie? What was that? For one thing, he-she-it wasn't in it long enough for us to care one way or other about the character where Philip Seymor Hoffman stole the show in the 1999 film. Marge? Ugh. Dickie? Weak, at best and he couldn't be murdered out of the movie fast enough for me.	think version ripley story faithful book lot series simply copy anthony minghella film way scene shoot direct copy early film stairway view murder freddie example start watch series major reservation trailer think tom dickie old character think black white seem film school affectation black white equal deep thoughtful get less able put doubt behind start watch help think series could better color young lead actor would dickie father care middle age son ship sail put politely director stair good portion series force watch people walk stair elevator work porter find go sure symbolism care figure exhaust far photography mostly get way instead tell story much like force watch neighbor vacation slide much series spend show tom walk around walk stair scrutinize hotel clerk answer way much sparse use story make eight episode unnecessary tom inspector good none actor take command role freddie one thing long enough we care one way character philip seymor hoffman steal show film marge ugh dickie weak good murder movie fast enough

(I realize they do this for drama, people, just being funny!!)Great show, good writing, Nathan Fillion does a wonderful job allowing his genuine & warm self thru into this character.It's not your typical police procedural, and that's what's great about it.It's as much a subtle & witty comedy as it is a drama.It can get a little cheesy & predictable, but it's fun. They aren't serving us caviar, they are serving us grilled cheeses with nice warm soup on a snowy, raw day. Makes ya feel all warm & fuzzy inside.There is sexual, professional & personal tensions so the subplots keep the show from being stale & they aren't overused - well, most aren't - & they keep the show's gaps filled so we can care about our heroes in blue - and it works (but I am over the ""boot"" hazing at this point...even though I know it's a big part of it, especially in the fabled LAPD & I assume it will last the entirety of season 1, w/ exception of maybe last episode or 2).Now, go enjoy this fantastic show."	good freshman season show base true event although doubt real guy face many bullet whole career much less boot time realize drama people funny great show good write nathan fillion wonderful job allow genuine warm self thru character typical police procedural great much subtle witty comedy drama get little cheesy predictable fun serve we caviar serve we grill cheese nice warm soup snowy raw day make ya feel warm fuzzy inside sexual professional personal tension subplot keep show stale overuse well keep show gap fill care hero blue work boot haze point even though know big part especially fable lapd assume last entirety season w exception maybe last episode go enjoy fantastic show

1	So I am almost through season 10 and I have to say that up till season 9 it was pretty great but due to the events in season 8 where some characters died. The new cast that is introduced in season 9 is no where near as interesting and neither is the actors. But the show is still watchable just not as enjoyable.	almost season say till season pretty great due event season character die new cast introduce season near interest neither actor show still watchable enjoyable
0	This is one show which would've benefited by being shot on location. The unmistakable evergreen forests of Canada immediately breaks a sense of immersion.The story feels low stakes, with boring subplots and meandering political machinations. Two ridiculous scenes in the pilot would give Tarantino an orgasm. A group of Japanese soldiers are almost overcome by a starving, weak pirate and in the same scene one of the said soldier has his sword taken from him by one of the weakened pirates. They had diversity behind the camera but still played the Western fantasy of overcoming Eastern might with ease.The show will probably do gangbuster numbers for the first few episodes but interest will fall if they don't pick up the slack. The characters at this stage are too thin, especially the Japanese who come across as one-dimensional and, in some cases, caricatures.	one show would benefit shoot location unmistakable evergreen forest canada immediately break sense immersion story feel low stake bore subplot meand political machination two ridiculous scene pilot would give tarantino orgasm group japanese soldier almost overcome starve weak pirate scene one say soldier sword take one weaken pirate diversity behind camera still play western fantasy overcome eastern might ease show probably gangbuster number first episode interest fall pick slack character stage thin especially japanese come across one dimensional case caricature
1	After I finished the first 4 episodes, I wanted to rate this show 9/10. As a fan of the books, I don't mind all the crazy changes, and I appreciated simplicity which makes it easy to understand.BUT, after episode 5, the pacing has changed. Episode 6, 7 and 8 are mostly dialogues and many of them are insignificant, boring and bad written! It feels like I'm watching a different show.I just don't understand why they have to cut off so many important info and many of the characters became boring and flat. Why can't they spend more time on Dr. Ye and Detective. Da Shi? Da Shi is so boring and useless in this show with no personality.	finish first episode want rate show fan book mind crazy change appreciate simplicity make easy understand episode pace change episode mostly dialogue many insignificant bore bad write feel like watch different show understand cut many important info many character become bore flat spend time dr ye detective da shi da shi bear useless show personality
1	I have enjoyed this show since the beginning, and was sad to see some of the actors had to leave the show but that's TV. However in the beginning in my opinion the stories were crisp and well written and believeable. I really like the relationships between the characters and that tackled serious issues with a just a touch of humor. I enjoyed this show so much that i would always watch on the following day after the firts broadcast so i can watch it on streaming because i get to skip commercials. Lately though i have been skipping episodes, because I find the stories lacking. One of my pet peeves is the relationship between Chen and Bradford I don't see it, there is no chemistry and they don't gell. And Nolans relationship, nada!! In Castle it was better!!! And the stories are just not as compelliing.	enjoy show since begin sad see actor leave show tv however begin opinion story crisp well write believeable really like relationship character tackle serious issue touch humor enjoy show much would always watch follow day firt broadcast watch stream get skip commercial lately though skip episode find story lack one pet peeve relationship chen bradford see chemistry gell nolans relationship nada castle well story compellie

0	As a longtime fan of the books, my expectations for this adaptation were high. However, I found that Saul and Auggie's portrayals significantly detracted from the series. Their characters seemed unnecessary and were particularly grating, which often pulled me out of the story. For example, Saul's constant pessimism didn't seem to add to the plot and could have been moderated for a more balanced character. Auggie's overly sarcastic tone and constant emotional instability felt out of place compared to the source material. If these characters had been either omitted or written with more depth and less annoyance, in a more realistic manner, the series could have been an 8 out of 10. Despite this, the adaptation did have its strengths, such as following the overall events of the series. By refining these characters, or just sticking to the source material, the series could better capture the essence of the beloved books.	longtime fan book expectation adaptation high however find saul auggie portrayal significantly detract series character seem unnecessary particularly grate often pull story example saul constant pessimism seem add plot could moderate balance character auggie overly sarcastic tone constant emotional instability feel place compare source material character either omit write depth less annoyance realistic manner series could despite adaptation strength follow overall event series refine character stick source material series could well capture essence beloved book
1	After two very interesting episodes, this series completely derailed imo. Too rushed, big holes in the script. This was a big letdown in the end. Examples of what annoyed me (spoilers here!): With such advanced technology, the San-Ti could've disrupted much more than they did;The Panama canal scene: they really thought shredding the whole ship was the best solution? The shredding should have caused explosions and they couldn't have known it would prevent destroying the harddiscs with information;How on earth could 300 nuclear bombs be put in space in 2024 the way they did? There was no explanation at all and that felt rushed and not credible since humanity only has a couple of worthy spacecrafts in 2024;The nuclear explosions were very close to the vessel and sail. Another thing that you should take for granted as a viewer, although it was again implausible.I could go on and on. The acting was good, visually it was great, but what promised to be a fantastic tale, ended up being a bad representation of that tale.	two interest episode series completely derail imo rush big hole script big letdown end example annoy spoiler advance technology san ti could disrupt much panama canal scene really think shred whole ship good solution shre cause explosion know would prevent destroy harddiscs information earth could nuclear bomb put space way explanation feel rush credible since humanity couple worthy spacecraft nuclear explosion close vessel sail another thing take grant viewer although implausible could go act good visually great promise fantastic tale end bad representation tale

0	Season 3 is trash with all it's woke messages dominating the show. Why cant we just be entertained anymore with good stories and acting??? Why does everything have to send a social message anymore? When September 11th occurred, most of Hollywood TV/Movies ignored it like it never happened...very few even touched it with a ten foot pole. However, George Floyd/BLM must dominate every police show now??? Both are tragic events, but I dont believe it must be the messaging in every cop show forever and ever. Another example is the covid pandemic...very few shows right now even acknowledge being shot during it, like it hasn't happened, no masks/no mention of it. I really dont understand why one storyline must dominate our entertainment??? I am for shows OCCASIONALLY exploring social issues (an episode here or there). I hoped season 4 would start fresh, but I had to turn it off as this show apparently has reached the ridiculous point already. It's such as shame as I love Nathan Fillion. His work, especially Castle is typically top notch. But I dont think even he can salvage this show.	season trash wake message dominate show can not entertain anymore good story act everything send social message anymore september th occur hollywood tv movie ignore like never happen even touch ten foot pole however george floyd blm must dominate every police show tragic event do not believe must message every cop show forever ever another example covid pandemic show right even acknowledge shoot like happen mask mention really do not understand one storyline must dominate entertainment show occasionally explore social issue episode hop season would start fresh turn show apparently reach ridiculous point already shame love nathan fillion work especially castle typically top notch do not think even salvage show
1	The show has become a victim of its own premise. When Fillion's character was a rookie in seasons one and two, it worked as he was fish out of water. Now he's no longer a rookie he is a very bland cop with a smug charm with little of dramatic interest in his character. The other characters who surround him - Bradford, Chen, Grey, Lopez - have far more interesting back stories and are potentially much more interesting in terms of their ongoing conflicts between their upbringing/beliefs and their roles as cops . But the show's premise now sidelines them as they revolve around the jolly Nolan whose story arc has run it's course.	show become victim premise fillion character rookie season one two work fish water long rookie bland cop smug charm little dramatic interest character character surround bradford chen grey lopez far interest back story potentially much interest term ongoing conflict upbringing belief role cop show premise sideline revolve around jolly nolan whose story arc run course
2	"This is a police drama that has a sprinkling of humour to keep a semi light tone through most of the episodes.This makes it quite an easy watch, the characters are well done and the plots are normally pretty good.However, it has some episodes that are so bad I feel they are unwatchable.To date we have: two terrible ""documentary"" episodes and last weeks was some nonsense about hacking in an episode that started with a significantly better tone.I don't think it would be harsh to say the bad episodes feel like they were part of someone's school project. Why did the producers make a second documentary episode when the first one received by far the lowest rating of any episode?"	police drama sprinkle humour keep semi light tone episode make quite easy watch character well do plot normally pretty good however episode bad feel unwatchable date two terrible documentary episode last week nonsense hack episode start significantly well tone think would harsh say bad episode feel like part someone school project producer make second documentary episode first one receive far low rat episode
1	I enjoy this show. It's a fairly light-hearted police dramedy that is believable, but doesn't take itself as seriously as other cop drama's like Chicago PD, SVU or Blue Bloods, which I kind of appreciate. The acting is overall pretty good and the characters are likeable. Last season was the strongest season and had the strongest storyline with the serial killer so I wish they would have dragged that out to more episodes. Not as strong as Castle, but still a win for Nathan Fillion.	enjoy show fairly light hearted police dramedy believable take seriously cop drama like chicago pd svu blue blood kind appreciate act overall pretty good character likeable last season strong season strong storyline serial killer wish would drag episode strong castle still win nathan fillion
2	Baby Reindeer is one of the most compelling, thought provoking and genuinely insightful pieces of TV I have seen. But it's also really entertaining.Creator and actor Richard Gadd pulls no punches in dissecting his own autobiographical story, going warts and all into some very dark and challenging places. But he also tells it in a way that remains upbeat, often funny and consistently engaging.It's rare that a male character is allowed to be as psychologically stripped bare as Donny is. But it's unique to see a man dealing with abuse, sexuality, masculinity and self-doubt in a way that is not preachy, depressing, patronising or fake.The cast are all excellent. Jessica Gunning, who plays Martha, is a complete revelation. I hope we get to see a lot more of her in future shows. Nava Mau really glows in her role, and her contribution to the story is so well done.This is a series that will stay with me for a long time. So happy to have seen it.I am amused by those reviewers asking for a second season though. What more do you want this poor guy to go through?	baby reindeer one compel think provoke genuinely insightful piece tv see also really entertain creator actor richard gadd pull punch dissect autobiographical story go wart dark challenge place also tell way remain upbeat often funny consistently engage rare male character allow psychologically strip bare donny unique see man deal abuse sexuality masculinity self doubt way preachy depress patronise fake cast excellent jessica gun play martha complete revelation hope get see lot future show nava mau really glow role contribution story well do series stay long time happy see amuse reviewer ask second season though want poor guy go

2	A Great remake of The Talented Mr Ripley movie but you can't beat the original. Matt Damon is exceptional and makes the movie what it is. Jude Law was great eye candy lolI think Gywenth Paltrow also does a much better job of Character Margo and I dont understand why they made Freddie's character a female actress playing a male? I must've missed the reason why coz she was clearly female lol the hair & suits didn't fool anyone lolHowever, Andrew Scott does a phenomenal job too, great actor. Thoroughly enjoyed this Netflix mini series!! Anyone who hasn't yet seen the original movie, it is an absolute MUST!! 9/10.	great remake talente mr ripley movie beat original matt damon exceptional make movie jude law great eye candy loli think gywenth paltrow also much well job character margo do not understand make freddie character female actress play male must miss reason coz clearly female lol hair suit fool anyone lolhowever andrew scott phenomenal job great actor thoroughly enjoy netflix mini series anyone yet see original movie absolute must

0	I was looking forward to this, something that promised to be an interesting take on hard-science what iffery. Not having read the books, I don't have any axe to grind with how good or not the adaption is - I just want to be entertained with compelling characters, interesting ideas, and just maybe a Netflix show that delivers on its promise.What we have here is a failure to communicate anything of substance. Catwalk pretty scientists allude to wikisearch results with all the depth of a Mr Men episode - simply referencing the existence of hard science does not make it that kind of show. Good looking young people ramp their expositional acting all the way up to 3 by way of first-take it'll-do directing. It really does not help with the dialogue has everyone talk with the same voice; there is no nuance between any of the characters, except Liam Cunningham who drops the C bomb every so often because he's Irish and that worked well for him in GoT.Anyway: somewhere out there, there are God like beings far more advanced than we can imagine. They are coming. They may get here sooner than Jesus, they may not. Hopefully both arrive at the same time and there's a proper religion V science kick-off. Neither can come soon enough if this show is any barometer of the smarts humanity allegedly possesses.Rich people want to be best positioned to take advantage, and will do whatever it takes to make that happen while creating more plot-holes per minute than any other show in living memory.The special effects are Dr Whovian, circa 2005.That's pretty much it.Enjoy.	look forward something promise interest take hard science iffery read book axe grind good adaption want entertain compel character interest idea maybe netflix show deliver promise failure communicate anything substance catwalk pretty scientist allude wikisearch result depth mr man episode simply reference existence hard science make kind show good look young people ramp expositional act way way first take direct really help dialogue everyone talk voice nuance character except liam cunningham drop c bomb every often irish work well get anyway somewhere god like be far advance imagine come may get soon jesus may hopefully arrive time proper religion v science kick neither come soon enough show barometer smart humanity allegedly possess rich people want good position take advantage whatever take make happen create plot hole per minute show live memory special effect dr whovian circa pretty much enjoy
0	A tedious, stretched out remake no one asked for, with baffling production choices. I don't know how 'true' to the source material this version of Ripley is, but it is certainly different from the film version and not for the better. This is shot in black & white for no reason at all. Why this digital, CRISPY looking black & white? This does absolutely NOTHING to enhance the story. This is a solid F on all levels: Failure of casting (the entire ensemble feel so disjointed and out of place) failure of directing, poorly paced. Just rewatch the Matt Damon version and call it a day.

He is cringeworthy every time he opens his mouth. It's an embarrassment how Americans feel they have to portray English. I promise you- no one sounds like that.The characters are OK'ish- it's not like Game of Thrones were some of the characters are absolutely vile- it's all a bit tepid.The fighting scenes are predictably fake. You know the type- can you 30 bad guys form an orderly queue to kill the one lady with a stick please?It reminds me of a family friendly Disney programme- wait. What?

2	"As a Chinese audience who has read the novel ""Three Body Problem"" more than three times during high school, I must applaud Netflix's efforts. It's not because it restores the magnificent imagination in the novel, nor because its special effects and performances are amazing, but because it uses a sufficiently simplified form to allow every ordinary foreigner who has not read the Three Body Problem novel to understand the charm of this masterpiece, even if it is only a small part.In China, criticism of Netflix's ""Three Body Problem"" series focuses on its highly simplified and adapted character relationships and images. For audiences who are familiar with the original work (such as myself), this is indeed somewhat difficult to accept, not because of insufficient performance, but because of the deviation between the character image and the expression in the book. When Dune 2 was released, I also heard fans of Dune novels expressing dissatisfaction with Villeneuve's adaptation in the movie, but this did not prevent me from enjoying the Dune series and buying back the novel to read - this is the most important role that an IP series should play, allowing the IP audience to continuously spread to the outside world and attract more viewers. The Chinese TV series ""The Three Body Problem"" undoubtedly excels in restoring characters and scenery much better than Netflix, but its extensive efforts in restoring novels - I cannot bear to criticize - have made the series very long and sluggish. Apart from fans, no one likes to watch a few people chatting in the same room for thirty minutes. My parents persisted for ten minutes, and I persisted for eight episodes. The data does not lie. The Chinese TV series ""Three Body Problem"", which was launched on China Central Television and mainstream streaming media networks, saw a drop in viewership to only hover around 1% in the middle stage. Considering the great efforts of the creators, this cannot be said to be a huge failure. That's also why I have such a high tolerance for Netflix's ""Three Body Problem"" series - it's shallow, simple, and even somewhat flattering, but it makes ordinary audiences watch it, and that's its victory, that's the cruel mass media.In Journey to the West, Sun Wukong did not worship a turtle as his teacher, nor did he have a divine dragon and seven dragon balls that could fulfill human wishes. However, this did not prevent Mr. Akira Toriyama from creating the great Dragon Ball comic, and more people searched for ancient Chinese classics because of it. I hope Netflix's ""Three Body Problem"" can have the same effect and attract more foreign friends to appreciate our excellent science fiction works in China. ""Three Body Problem"" contains Eastern people's thoughts on human destiny and nature, which may not be correct, but in a certain direction.Love comes from China for you."	chinese audience read novel three body problem three time high school must applaud netflix effort restore magnificent imagination novel special effect performance amaze use sufficiently simplify form allow every ordinary foreigner read three body problem novel understand charm masterpiece even small part china criticism netflix three body problem series focus highly simplify adapt character relationship image audience familiar original work indeed somewhat difficult accept insufficient performance deviation character image expression book dune release also hear fan dune novel express dissatisfaction villeneuve adaptation movie prevent enjoy dune series buy back novel read important role ip series play allow ip audience continuously spread outside world attract viewer chinese tv series three body problem undoubtedly excel restore character scenery much well netflix extensive effort restore novel bear criticize make series long sluggish apart fan one like watch people chat room thirty minute parent persist ten minute persist eight episode datum lie chinese tv series three body problem launch china central television mainstream stream medium network see drop viewership hover around middle stage consider great effort creator say huge failure also high tolerance netflix three body problem series shallow simple even somewhat flatter make ordinary audience watch victory cruel mass medium journey west sun wukong worship turtle teacher divine dragon seven dragon ball could fulfill human wish however prevent mr akira toriyama create great dragon ball comic people search ancient chinese classic hope netflix three body problem effect attract foreign friend appreciate excellent science fiction work china three body problem contain eastern people thought human destiny nature may correct certain direction love come china

2	I really wanted to rate GOT a 10 but the last season was such a disappointment i couldn't. The problem with the last season is the writing there are lots of plots that either get ignored or a unsatisfying conclusion. Also some of the character arch's just seem stupid in the last season. However the first 7 seasons are contain some of the best writing and visuals that TV has to offer. No character on this show is safe and main characters get killed off all the time. I would defiantly recommend watching the first 7 seasons of this show and then maybe make up your own ending because it will almost definitely be better than the actual ending.	really want rate get last season disappointment problem last season write lot plot either get ignore unsatisfying conclusion also character arch seem stupid last season however first season contain good write visual tv offer character show safe main character get kill time would defiantly recommend watch first season show maybe make end almost definitely well actual end

0	The actor who plays Blackthorne in Shogun is terrible. Also, poor writing lets down the show. Once the naval crew is captured, they can't act like bosses. The most logical thing should have been to be respectful and stay calm. Since that time, Japan was trading with Europeans its highly unlikely that they wanted to kill the crew without validating their cause.Additionally, the writing struggles to maintain momentum after the initial capture, with the plot lacking depth and the characters falling into predictable archetypes.Also lack of respect to Portuguese language is a major concern. In positive note, costumes and inertial design are up to the standard. Also they use Japanese as primary language which is obvious thing to do.	actor play blackthorne shogun terrible also poor write let show naval crew capture act like boss logical thing respectful stay calm since time japan trade europeans highly unlikely want kill crew without validate cause additionally write struggle maintain momentum initial capture plot lack depth character fall predictable archetype also lack respect portuguese language major concern positive note costume inertial design standard also use japanese primary language obvious thing

1	It started out great in season 1, became a bit over the top in season 2 with rookies being involved in major crimes every day, then season 3 became a social lecture in race relations, gender issues, socio economic concerns, and other touchy feely stuff.I'm not against having these issues as center pieces in TV shows. Honestly, it's the only way American adults are educated these days, but c'mon.

2	Every single scene and thing serves a purpose here. You may argue that sometimes it feels too deliberate, but compared to many other films which simply put things together, thoughtlessly, this deliberateness is a plus.For some reason, the English-speaking characters, apart from Ripley - the real Greenleaf, Marge and Freddie - are less savory compared to the Italian ones? I'm not sure why (passivity - sensing Ripley is crooked but not doing anything? Hypocrisy? Nepo babies?), maybe it's intended that way, maybe it's the aura of self-importance.And the Italian cast, like Inspector Ravini (Maurizio Lombardi) left as big an imprint, if not more, as characters like the real Greenleaf, so in my opinion they should be given equal credit and accolades... even though, historically speaking, I know only the anglophones will be properly mentioned and remembered.	every single scene thing serve purpose may argue sometimes feel deliberate compare many film simply put thing together thoughtlessly deliberateness plus reason english speak character apart ripley real greenleaf marge freddie less savory compare italian one sure passivity sense ripley crook anything hypocrisy nepo baby maybe intend way maybe aura self importance italian cast like inspector ravini maurizio lombardi leave big imprint character like real greenleaf opinion give equal credit accolade even though historically speak know anglophone properly mention remember
2	"If you're a fan of Liu Cixin's book, you'd appreciate the accurate thrill and fear of aliens, not only their plight, issues and the familiarity of another life form's struggle. But also lays bare the threat of the ""Dark Forest"" theory which outlines the potential danger of a highly advanced species finding out about a less primitive species.Much like how European colonizers treated less advanced people's they came across by oppressing and wiping them out. This point is also brought out by how we treat bugs or less intelligent species on our own planet, we never bat and eye about killing cockroaches or flies everyday, which is a perfect metaphor for how the aliens view us.Lastly not to reveal too much, I'm glad they tried to follow real science as much as possible."	fan liu cixin book appreciate accurate thrill fear alien plight issue familiarity another life form struggle also lie bare threat dark forest theory outline potential danger highly advance specie find less primitive specie much like european colonizer treat less advance people come across oppress wipe point also bring treat bug less intelligent specie planet never bat eye kill cockroach fly everyday perfect metaphor alien view we lastly reveal much glad try follow real science much possible
2	I have to say I've really enjoyed The Rookie even more than I though I would. I've been a Nathan Fillan fan since Castle and he really shines here. He stars as John Nolan, a 40-something year rookie for the LAPD. After a life altering incident he chooses to pursue his dream of becoming a police officer. As the oldest rookie he has to persuade skeptics that he's cut out for the job and that this isn't some mid life crisis. These are several supporting characters in this and they all bring a sense of entertainment to the show. It's a really easy show to sit back and watch and even have on as background viewing. It's one of the better cop shows of the last few years.	say really enjoy rookie even though would nathan fillan fan since castle really shin star john nolan something year rookie lapd life alter incident choose pursue dream become police officer old rookie persuade skeptic cut job mid life crisis several support character bring sense entertainment show really easy show sit back watch even background view one well cop show last year

0	It started interesting but the plot deteriorated quickly. To name a few, 1. An entire high intelligence specie is invading earth because one in 7 billion people send them an invitation? I mean, what if no one answered, they would just die?2. We know for a fact and based on our basic technology that there is 40 billion planet like earth. Why a high intelligent species would choose a very problematic planet like earth.3. Since they monitor everything, they should know, by the time they arrive, we would have destroyed earth either by war, global warming ... etc. We are a self destructive specie, just give us time and we will do it for you.4. There is five known extinction on earth that wiped out life completely, how earth is still a viable option?5. A specie evolved in planet of three stars would definitely perish in a different environment. Humans are already struggling with few degrees increase of temperature due to global warming.6. If they were a high intelligence specie, they would have incited wars by recruiting agents and rest assure we will wipe ourselves out and earth will be ready for them when they arrive. By sending us warning, they actually united the human race against them and accelerated our development.7. Dont start with the lying thing. Even animals lies to hunt their preys. They claim to have studied our history, they should know better that our history was based on deception and lies since the beginning of time but they were shocked when they learn we lie from the red hood girl children story .. lol.8. The part where they refused to send swat team to infiltrate the oil tanker fearing a bloodbath but decide to use an unstable nano fiber technology to cut through the tanker killing everyone and destroying everything including the hard drives. The oil tanker was going to some harbor to fuel, it literally moves at a maximum speed of 30km per hour and it is in god damn canal !!! It is not going anywhere anytime soon. They had all the time in the world to plan their infiltration.9. The stupidest plan ever to send a spacecraft and accelerate it using 1000 explosives !!!!. Couldn't they just use planets gravity like voyager 1 and 2 to reach high speeds. And what was the purpose of it all ? They are already in communication with the alien race.

Unfortunately I feel compelled to continue watching since I've been with the show for all this time, but it serves more as background noise than anything else.

If you took a few classes on photography, you'd soon find it's largely considered amateurish. The music is louder than the dialogue making it difficult to understand anything. Seriously, it's not that hard to balance the audio levels. Complete fail. It's a mish mash of history & fantasy, sorry but that's what it is. Lots of sub titles, why? When Europeans speak, it's modern English so why bother with Japanese. So pretentious. Pick a language & stick with it. It's either a Japanese film or an English film... NEVER both!The costumes etc are great. I'd prefer consistency to nice costumes & sets but who cares about that these days. Better to be pretentious and pseudo multicultural.So, if you are looking for some pretentious crap, this is the one for you.	bore pretentious lot light flare lense guess suppose atmospheric take class photography soon find largely consider amateurish music loud dialogue make difficult understand anything seriously hard balance audio level complete fail mish mash history fantasy sorry lot sub title europeans speak modern english bother japanese pretentious pick language stick either japanese film english film never costume etc great prefer consistency nice costume set care day well pretentious pseudo multicultural look pretentious crap one

Unfortunately, towards the end, the show's quality dropped in so many unexpected and unforgivable ways. It is easily the Best Tv Show ever, if not for the the last two seasons. If you are new, and can't decide whether to watch it or not, I'd suggest give it a try. GOT has got his moments. You'll totally love it but yes, the last couple of seasons will disappoint you.

This is one review that I don't want even a hint of a spoiler in, so I'm going to do my best to review without giving any of the story away because it's that good. I started this completely blind, because it's a rainy Saturday at home, and it was new on Netflix. I'm so happy I did because it was a great series. So good that I not only binged it but watched it without ever checking my phone or getting distracted by anything else. The pace is great, keeps you not only interested but just as you think you know what's happening, you're surprised again and again. Sometimes heartbreaking surprises, sometimes heartwarming surprises.This is not a typical ""stalker"" movie, it's so much more, that it is a disservice calling it that. It has so much depth from all the characters. Yet all the fat is trimmed, so it just makes the characters more complex but keeps the plot going.I really wasn't prepared for the diverse emotions from utter loneliness all the way to unconditional love and anything in between like anger, trauma etc. People are created by our experiences and where we take those experiences and what we choose to do with them. Maybe because I now know it's based on a true story that these people are so well developed and multifaceted. The acting is superb! It's a richly rewarding watch.

I really like it but there were some things in the last episodes that made me gave it a 7.Spoilers!!!!!What I didn't like: the fact that Greenleaf's girlfriend was too stupidthe inspector who at first seemed very intelligent it ends being a moroon. For example the scene where Ripley was disguised very poorly, the fact that he never asked for a picture of Greenleaf, the fact that the witness told him practically that Ripley carried an unconscious Freddie to the car exactly at the time of his death and didn't arrest him immediately. He didn't even asked the owner of the place what happened that night she could have told him that she heard a big noise on the stairs like someone carrying something heavy lol.and most importantly why they didn't informed USA embassy that 2 Americans are missing and one is dead.if the inspector would have checked Ripley prints he would have found out he was seek by the police in USA which again I think even in that period when prints system was quite ok and Interpol existed since 1920 WTH? They could at least have called NYPD.Yep there are many dumb things but overall was enjoyable.	first read book review see without care difference book really like thing last episode make give spoiler like fact greenleaf girlfriend stupidthe inspector first seem intelligent end moroon example scene ripley disguise poorly fact never ask picture greenleaf fact witness tell practically ripley carry unconscious freddie car exactly time death arrest immediately even ask owner place happen night could tell hear big noise stair like someone carry something heavy lol importantly inform usa embassy americans miss one dead inspector would check ripley print would find seek police usa think even period print system quite ok interpol exist since wth could least call nypd yep many dumb thing overall enjoyable
0	I happened upon this series in season 1 Episode 1 and was hooked from S1-S4. This is a fantastic show rich with character growth and unforgettable world building. The introduction of magic & prophecies had me skeptical but the rich story and top notch acting kept me engaged.As the show grew, as did production values - yet still, even in seasons 5 & 6, the roots of the original 4 seasons showed through and still delivered good character interaction.However by season 5, the source material has dried up and the 'showrunners' must produce by cliffnotes. This is when dialogue turns to ash in your mouth and great leaps are made in storytelling to get characters where they need to be for the next plot point.By seasons 7 & 8 the show is clearly leapfrogging its way to the end game - making major plot compromises to create the conflict and storyline they are looking for.While the books remain to be published and redeem this storyline, perhaps providing some sensible storytelling - this show is amongst one of the most poorly concluded series of all time.	happen upon series season episode hook fantastic show rich character growth unforgettable world build introduction magic prophecy skeptical rich story top notch act keep engage show grow production value yet still even season root original season show still deliver good character interaction however season source material dry showrunner must produce cliffnote dialogue turn ash mouth great leap make storytelling get character need next plot point season show clearly leapfrog way end game make major plot compromise create conflict storyline look book remain publish redeem storyline perhaps provide sensible storytelle show amongst one poorly conclude series time

This serie had my full attention, something not many series seem to achieve since I have my mobile phone to distract me. I love how the world is built I love how the characters don't play the cliche ""ohhh you lied to me now we can't be friends lines."" It was a journey, a great one and I long for more.

2	Visually brilliant. Excellent acting. And of course, James Clavell's fabulous story as a basis. The acting is top notch across the board, but particular praise needs to be given to Hiroyuki Sanada.BUT....As an old man born in the Far East, of course I've read most of James Clavell's books. I also watched the 1980 version with Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune. And whilst as a spectacle this version is better (21st century production standards and technology, of course), at the point of writing (episode 3) this production falls short of true greatness. Why? Simply because they have rushed the story. The promotion of Blackthorn to Hatamoto, for example, appears out of nowhere. Blackthorn's respect for Toranaga seems to appear out of nowhere.	visually brilliant excellent act course jam clavell fabulous story basis act top notch across board particular praise need give hiroyuki sanada old man bear far east course read jam clavell book also watch version richard chamberlain toshiro mifune whilst spectacle version well st century production standard technology course point write episode production fall short true greatness simply rush story promotion blackthorn hatamoto example appear nowhere blackthorn respect toranaga seem appear nowhere
0	This show hasn't been that great since they killed off Barristan Selmy.It kind of exemplifies how the writers care more about satisfying the 'shock value crowd' with surprise character deaths, than maintaining character consistency or interesting dialogue. Whether it be a close up of a penis with warts, the half dead Mountain raping a nun, or an Ed Sheeran cameo, the show is just kinda 'meh' now.	show great since kill barristan selmy kind exemplify writer care satisfy shock value crowd surprise character death maintain character consistency interest dialogue whether close penis wart half dead mountain rap nun ed sheeran cameo show kinda meh
1	The previews of this tell an autobiographical story of how an unsuspecting bar tender named Donny (Richard Gadd) fells somewhat sorry for an overweight, older woman who comes into his bar crying. He's nice to her and she instantly bonds to him in an unhealthy way. Ito goes on for quite some time before he reports it. The lag in time for his reporting is explained in the series so I won't go into it here.The things I liked about it.1. The acting of the leads. Richard Gadd was ok, but Jessica Gunning carried the movie.2. The first 4 episodes were good, then it sort of went from a dark comedy to just dark.3. I haven't seen someting quite like this before 4. The ending and not in a sarcastic way, it ended kind of nicely for me.The things I didn't like.1. The character of Donny. He makes stupid decisions and then when whines about why his life sucks. Hello!2. The actress who played Teri wasn't a very good actress.3. This didn't need to be a mini-series. The whole story could have been told in an hour and a half movie.If you're a member of the LGBTQ+ or a woman or identify as a woman, you may like this story better than those not in any of those communities. It's definitely not a family series so don't invite the kids.	preview tell autobiographical story unsuspecte bar tender name donny richard gadd fall somewhat sorry overweight old woman come bar cry nice instantly bond unhealthy way ito go quite time report lag time report explain series go thing like act lead richard gadd ok jessica gun carry movie first episode good sort go dark comedy dark see somete quite like end sarcastic way end kind nicely thing like character donny make stupid decision whine life suck hello actress play teri good actress need mini series whole story could tell hour half movie member lgbtq woman identify woman may like story well community definitely family series invite kid

1	This is my Favourite show ever, it makes the person forget every single thing in his life and makes him think all the time about what will happen in the next episode .I'm kind of people that hate medical shows whatever it was, it makes me hate everything in my body believe me or not ,but this show change every single thing in my life ,before this show comes out I never set against the T.V screen to watch a Drama series more 15 minutes ,because I thought it's so boring and useless.This show is really change my ideas about the drama series.Most of the times you think that nothing can change what you believe in ,I know it's so hard to do it and it makes you sometimes confuse ,but for the people around you and the people who you like Give It A Shot. Excellent acting from the cast with a beautiful stories and drama makes this show remembered by a lot of people.Love relationships with Shock endings like what happened in the end of season 1 between Patrick Dempsey and Ellen Pompeo,Justin Chambers and Katherine Heigl in the beginning of season 2 ,and between Sandra Oh and Isaiah Washington in season 3,and others happened in the 4 seasons.In my opinion, Grey's Anatomy is the best show in the century,so make a change and watch it ,because it worth it !Overall Score: 9.6/10	favourite show ever make person forget every single thing life make think time happen next episode kind people hate medical show whatever make hate everything body believe show change every single thing life show come never set v screen watch drama series minute think bore useless show really change idea drama series time think nothing change believe know hard make sometimes confuse people around people like give shoot excellent act cast beautiful story drama make show remember lot people love relationship shock end like happen end season patrick dempsey ellen pompeo justin chamber katherine heigl begin season sandra oh isaiah washington season other happen season opinion grey anatomy well show century make change watch worth overall score

Nothing is realistic. Everything is bland. Tasteless. This a serie created with the name fallout and fallout character, but not in the philosophy of a real fallout world. Not think for the old fans who made fallout known in the world.only references to fallout 4. As if bethesda wants to send a message (fallout 1, 2, new vegas do not exist).

1	It goes without saying I suppose that the series is beautiful to watch. The acting is solid but the story and some characters are badly flawed. The largest gaping hole it seems to me is the San-Ti travel time vs Human's progress. The San-Ti are apparently much more advanced than humans but somehow, now that they have escaped their destructive world, their progress will go into stasis. Wut? Also, despite the fact that our entire world has looming extermination in our sights a few scientists have trouble disposing of the San-Ti's cohort here on Earth. Wut? There are other holes too that are irritating but you get the idea. If you want to watch a good movie (only an hour and a half long!) about quantum mechanics check out Coherence. It's far more advanced in science than 3 Body Problem.	go without say suppose series beautiful watch act solid story character badly flaw large gap hole seem san ti travel time vs human progress san ti apparently much advance human somehow escape destructive world progress go stasis wut also despite fact entire world loom extermination sight scientist trouble dispose san ti cohort earth wut hole irritate get idea want watch good movie hour half long quantum mechanic check coherence far advance science body problem
2	Fallout was one of my first games ever and played every single one of them, i'm huge fanboy too and i can't believe those fanatics giving low ratings lol. I was expecting something worse to be honest but other than some minor setbacks that can surely be ignored, even newcomers can really enjoy this fun show. Yes for the newcomers this universe has a lot to take in and in the first glance it can be really really overwhelming and the show does not make a good job to ease you in, it does it later on but they should have just start with 'war, war never changes' and explain the state of the world for the viewers to digest it in. After a few episodes it really explains a lot expecially about the vault tec and the political, social, ethical spects about the universe but for an 8 episode series they should have done the explaining in 15 minutes and jump into the action. It's so goofy and cheesy and it doesnt take itself seriously like the games, acting is great even though i was prepared to hate Lucy but i didn't lol. Goggins is delight to watch as always, Maximus is an amazing character with a plenty of room to grow. Music is unbelievable, designs are Oscar worthy, great production really captures the life in the vaults but it comes a little bit short when it comes to westlands but it will become better in S2 i hope. Screw the fanatic fanboys really just enjoy this beauty..	fallout one first game ever play every single one huge fanboy believe fanatic give low rat lol expect something bad honest minor setback surely ignore even newcomer really enjoy fun show yes newcomer universe lot take first glance really really overwhelm show make good job ease later start war war never change explain state world viewer digest episode really explain lot expecially vault tec political social ethical spect universe episode series do explain minute jump action goofy cheesy do not take seriously like game act great even though prepare hate lucy lol goggin delight watch always maximus amaze character plenty room grow music unbelievable design oscar worthy great production really capture life vault come little bite short come westland become well hope screw fanatic fanboy really enjoy beauty
1	This series is based on the game of the same name. I didn't play the game and the series was exciting and fun for me. The series shows the future when the world has been destroyed due to nuclear wars and the majority of its population has been destroyed and only a part of the earth's population who were previously in special shelters have been saved. The story starts with a certain excitement and this excitement continues throughout the story. The characterization of the main actors is done well. The struggle between the survivors for survival is well and excitingly shown. The future of the earth with these people will be very terrible.	series base game name play game series excite fun series show future world destroy due nuclear war majority population destroy part earth population previously special shelter save story start certain excitement excitement continue throughout story characterization main actor do well struggle survivor survival well excitingly show future earth people terrible

1	"Season 1 of The Rookie was some of the best police procedural of all time, both in terms of technical details and as entertainment. Since then it has been going downhill.The show used to be about -+ Struggles of a 40-year-old who had a midlife crisis and became a cop.+ The sharp contrast in attitude of a person who has attained maturity outside of the system compared to regular cops.+ Authentic (by TV show standards) nitty-gritty of police work and training, both good and bad.+ The massive impact on a newly minted cop of killing someone in the line of duty.+ Flawed relatable characters trying to do their best.+ Impact of a cop's job on their personal life.Now it is about -X Insufferable Mary Sue characters that have replaced many of the more complex and relatable original roster. Even characters originally worth rooting for like Lopez and Harper, have become insufferable and a distraction from the core subject matter.X Cops mowing down bad guys like 90s action heroes or video game characters. Completely bonkers off the rails nonsense like shootout in the desert, patrol cops (including a rookie) practically conducting CIA black ops on foreign soil.X Family drama and romantic comedy.X Detectives Cagney and Lacey having babies every few episodes. I mean, I am fine with them having babies, but does it have to involve a major story event every time?X The Fire Department, which apparently has only one insufferable employee assigned to every 911 call. From Sarah Shahi to Ali Larter to this one. What a downgrade, for Nolan and for the viewers.X Psychics.X The ""Dim and Juicy"" stuff.... It genuinely feels like a parody of the police procedural that this show used to be.The show is in danger of going from The Wire to Police Academy. My request to showrunners (not that anyone will care) is to cut down the rom-com family drama and go back to what made the first season so incredible. I understand and appreciate the need for characters to grow, but the show itself should maintains its original spirit and scope. Otherwise, it is bait and switch. Like, if Nolan has another epiphany and decided to join beauty school like he once joked, is that going to be new subject of the show?"	season rookie good police procedural time term technical detail entertainment since go downhill show use struggle year old midlife crisis become cop sharp contrast attitude person attain maturity outside system compare regular cop authentic tv show standard nitty gritty police work train good bad massive impact newly mint cop kill someone line duty flaw relatable character try good impact cop job personal life x insufferable mary sue character replace many complex relatable original roster even character originally worth root like lopez harper become insufferable distraction core subject matter x cop mow bad guy like action hero video game character completely bonker rail nonsense like shootout desert patrol cop include rookie practically conduct cia black op foreign soil x family drama romantic comedy x detective cagney lacey baby every episode mean fine baby involve major story event every time x fire department apparently one insufferable employee assign every call sarah shahi ali larter one downgrade nolan viewer x psychic x dim juicy stuff genuinely feel like parody police procedural show use show danger go wire police academy request showrunner anyone care cut rom com family drama go back make first season incredible understand appreciate need character grow show maintain original spirit scope otherwise bait switch like nolan another epiphany decide join beauty school like joke go new subject show
0	Disgusting use of extreme graphic violence that does not necessarily serve the plot. Hard to watch, I felt nauseous in the middle of the first episode and stopped watching it.It's like ruining a good restaurant dish with copious amounts of hot pepper and salt, a reasonable person wouldn't be able to enjoy it unless their senses are so dulled by past exposure to a great deal of violent content. In my opinion, it would have been possible to convey the same plot even without injecting quantities of fake blood at the very beginning. If you have a sensitive stomach, save yourself from watching this series.	disgust use extreme graphic violence necessarily serve plot hard watch feel nauseous middle first episode stop watch like ruin good restaurant dish copious amount hot pepper salt reasonable person able enjoy unless sense dull past exposure great deal violent content opinion would possible convey plot even without inject quantities fake blood begin sensitive stomach save watch series

1	I never thought another show could replace Lord of the Rings or Breaking Bad as my favorite shows ever. However, GoT quickly replaced them and has been my greatest addiction ever since. And it is because I love(d)this show so much that it literally pains me to see how catastrophically they have botched and butchered its final season. It began with the Battle of Winterfell, and the show has been in a tailspin ever since. Others have already elaborated the reasons for why that is. I just think it very sad to so poorly end what had been such a great show for 7 seasons. I will not degrade my Seasons 1 through 7 Blu-Rays collection with those from this final season. They're not something I'd enjoy rewatching as I have the others...	never think another show could replace lord ring break bad favorite show ever however get quickly replace great addiction ever since love show much literally pain see catastrophically botch butcher final season begin battle winterfell show tailspin ever since other already elaborate reason think sad poorly end great show season degrade season blu ray collection final season something enjoy rewatche other

I can't remember the last time I was so moved, fascinated, horrified and uncomfortable watching a series. It was hard to watch and yet I couldn't look away. I turned it off at one point... but half an hour later went back to finish it. The events were presented in a way that made you question your own biases, choices, and preconceived beliefs about what you think constitutes a stalker, a victim, about the confusion and shame of people struggling with their sexual identity, as well as the dynamics of sexual coercion and men's mental health which is so often ridiculed and minimized. When it came time to rate it I couldn't decide between ""not for me"" and ""loved it."" As soon as I finished the series I had to get out of my head for a while and went for a hike but literally couldn't stop thinking about the show.

2	The series is quite good, it perfectly conveys the atmosphere. For those who played the game should like it. I love the post-apocalypse theme. There are not many films on this topic. What disappointed me was the casting for the role of Maximus. Where did they even find this actor? He's pretty uninteresting and uncharismatic, and he's mad throughout the series. The rest of the actors are well chosen. The soundtrack is cool. It's a pity that there are not many episodes, I would like more. Hopefully there will be many seasons and not many years to wait. Nuclear Coca-Cola to all. After the series, you will want to play the game again.	series quite good perfectly convey atmosphere play game like love post apocalypse theme many film topic disappoint cast role maximus even find actor pretty uninteresting uncharismatic mad throughout series rest actor well choose soundtrack cool pity many episode would like hopefully many season many year wait nuclear coca cola series want play game
1	The sets and the vibe do a great job at capturing the essence of Fallout. The ghoul and Norm are carrying the show on their back in my opinion. The show has some great scenes. But there is room for improvement with writing, directing, acting and actor choices.A major gripe of mine is the pacing in many scenes. For example (one of many), the scene in episode eight between Lucy and her dad where he is asking her to go home with him, lasted way too long. We get it, she's devastated and isn't sure what to do. But the scene didn't need to be dragged out to get that point across. These awkwardly long scenes can cost the dramatic effect they are trying to achieve. Also timing between dialog and characters were bungled from time to time. For instance; all of Thaddeus's dialog felt awkward and it seemed as if the actor hasn't performed a day in his life. It was immersion breaking.Another immersion breaking constant was Aaron Moten (Maximus). This main character is given the least amount of backstory in this season and his character comes off childish and inept, in turn his scenes with Lucy and other character's are off putting. As if the actor is deciding scene to scene how he's going to play his character and it comes across as lacking consistency. I was unable to tell if Aaron is just a bad actor or the show needs better directors.Fight scenes were clunky at times, The injected humor in scenes didn't come across the way I think the show intended. But I can let that slide.However, overall I feel they did a good job and would like to see where they go in Season 2.	set vibe great job capture essence fallout ghoul norm carry show back opinion show great scene room improvement write direct act actor choice major gripe mine pace many scene example one many scene episode eight lucy dad ask go home last way long get devastate sure scene need drag get point across awkwardly long scene cost dramatic effect try achieve also time dialog character bungle time time instance thaddeus dialog feel awkward seem actor perform day life immersion break another immersion break constant aaron moten maximus main character give least amount backstory season character come childish inept turn scene lucy character put actor decide scene scene go play character come across lack consistency unable tell aaron bad actor show need well director fight scene clunky time inject humor scene come across way think show intend let slide however overall feel good job would like see go season
2	Having seen all the screen versions of the Ripley saga I think this was outstanding. Not many films or series work in black and white these days but the camera work and production result in an absolutely authentic work that shows Italy in a very different way.An excellent series based on the original gripping story which is more atmospheric than the earlier versions imo. Andrew Scott and Dakota Fanning are brilliant and the casting throughout is very good. It's one episode too long I think as it can drag in places but overall I'd highly recommend it and will watch it again at some point.A nice little nod to the past in having John Malkovich appear in the final episode.	see screen version ripley saga think outstanding many film series work black white day camera work production result absolutely authentic work show italy different way excellent series base original grip story atmospheric early version imo andrew scott dakota fan brilliant cast throughout good one episode long think drag place overall highly recommend watch point nice little nod past john malkovich appear final episode
0	"The concept of a mature, successful, blue-collar man reinventing himself as an urban police officer is an interesting concept for a movie, or even a miniseries. But, when he makes it past being a ""boot"", it becomes just another by-the-numbers cop show. And that's where ""The Rookie"" has stagnated since it's first season. So it's writers and producers have had to resort to improbable situations and romances to pad the script. And there are, of course, lots of thinly-veiled but profound messages regarding ""equity"", ""diversity"", and ""inclusion"". And then they tied it in to a show about an overweight, black, female FBI agent...!

2	If you're a fan of the Fallout video game series, you'll likely enjoy this series and eagerly anticipate its continuation after watching. However, for those unfamiliar with the Fallout games, their reaction might be uncertain, as certain aspects may not be fully understood. It's recommended they approach it as a sci-fi or cyberpunk series. Despite being episodic, the first episode captivated me, leading to a binge-watch of the entire series. The storyline progressively improves, and the main characters are very engaging. Fans of conspiracy theories may find this series particularly appealing as I did.	fan fallout video game series likely enjoy series eagerly anticipate continuation watch however unfamiliar fallout game reaction might uncertain certain aspect may fully understand recommend approach sci fi cyberpunk series despite episodic first episode captivate lead binge watch entire series storyline progressively improve main character engage fan conspiracy theory may find series particularly appeal

0	"***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***I'm reading the first book and I'm about 200 pages in, so all of this plot is still very fresh in my mind for what I just saw on Episode 1. I don't understand why this show has such high reviews...perhaps the obscene amounts of gore and nudity? I only watched Episode 1 of Season 1 and that is all I will watch, for reasons I will make known below. Before that, I would like to state that this series may reflect the book, but it taints the reputation of the book and the reflection is not accurate in the least bit.Characters: First of all, the ages of all the children are older than in the books...which I'm assuming will make nudity of the girls...more acceptable to the audience??? Jon Snow is not at ALL what I pictured him to be...I mean it gives a physical description of him in the book...so there's no excuse for that. However, most other characters do look a lot like I would have imagined (esp. Arya and Ned), just not Jon.When the show began it completely butchered the scene of the Night Watch men who encountered the Others. The wildlings on the ground were not butchered and the man who deserted after the encounter only survived because he climbed up a tree. I know that seems like a small deviation, but for a series that claims to be so close to the book, the opening scene was screwed up. The execution of the deserter was handled well, but what about Bran's big question? Following the execution, the dire wolves scene was mishandled as well. The actor playing Jon did not look as though he was caught off guard by finding the runt. Speaking of that, all of the plot was rushed much too much. The actors failed at capturing the nuances, pauses, and facial expressions that these characters make. I was frustrated throughout the whole episode because it seemed to rush to the nudity, which is FAR LESS IMPORTANT than, say, the scene where Ned and Robert were underground paying respects to the dead. That scene deserved more than it was given. They didn't bring Robert and Ned's relationship to life, instead they make Robert look like a man-whore and they made him look soft (as in fat is whole life). The king should be hardened, but with a softness that only Ned can bring out in him...Mark Addy is NOT Robert Baratheon. No, no, no. I'm so mad at myself for watching this because now all of the faces of the characters will be associated with the actors...Boo!The sex scene with the Imp and all of the whores was completely fabricated...I mean that was just completely unnecessary. So many people are stating that this series handles sex maturely, but it takes something sacred and makes it absolutely disgusting. The book did not handle sex this way at all! Also, Daenerys is supposed to be a 13 year old virgin and the show had the actress who played her take part in two obscenely long nude scenes. I'm sorry (not really), but that actress does not act very innocent or afraid and I don't think she can because she is too willing to pull her drawers down. The sex scene between her and Drogo was not handled well either because it made Drogo seem way more barbaric than he actually is in the book (according to that specific scene in the book). They didn't have time to throw in the fact that he tenderly asked her for permission? I mean, really? That scene in the book ended in mutual agreement...(well as much as possible considering the circumstances). Now, the sex scene of Cersai and her brother was pretty much dead on for the book...I will admit that much. Pros: The costumes, props, and scenery are somewhat nice. That's it. You can't build up a show on nice backdrops and cool clothing though. Overall impression:-The necessary scenes were rushed. -Important details were completely neglected. -Some characters are all wrong and the ages of the children are fudged. -Sex has devolved into a barbaric act of overpowering women. -Most of the nudity is unnecessary and is OVERWHELMINGLY uneven (all full-on naked women) -Props and scenery are nice. -Whorehouse scene completely fabricated.PLEASE READ THE BOOK. You'll understand why so many of the people who read the book are angry. Now I'm off to read the book some more, but I think I've made it quite obvious that this show has dragged down my overall ""A Game of Thrones"" experience. I don't even know if I'll finish it now, but I definitely won't be back to watch this ridiculous adaptation of it.Last words: The actress playing Daenerys is so beyond wrong. I actually feel bad for the made-up character in the book!BLEH! >:("	spoiler alert spoiler alert spoiler alert spoiler alert read first book page plot still fresh mind see episode understand show high review perhaps obscene amount gore nudity watch episode season watch reason make know would like state series may reflect book taint reputation book reflection accurate least bite character first age child old book assume make nudity girl acceptable audience jon snow picture mean give physical description book excuse however character look lot like would imagine esp arya ned jon show begin completely butcher scene night watch man encounter other wildling grind butcher man desert encounter survive climb tree know seem like small deviation series claim close book open scene screw execution deserter handle well bran big question follow execution dire wolf scene mishandle well actor play jon look though catch guard find runt speak plot rush much much actor fail capture nuance pause facial expression character make frustrate throughout whole episode seem rush nudity far less important say scene ned robert underground pay respect dead scene deserve give bring robert ned relationship life instead make robert look like man whore make look soft fat whole life king harden softness ned bring mark addy robert baratheon mad watch face character associate actor boo sex scene imp whore completely fabricate mean completely unnecessary many people state series handle sex maturely take something sacred make absolutely disgust book handle sex way also daenery suppose year old virgin show actress play take part two obscenely long nude scene sorry really actress act innocent afraid think will pull drawer sex scene drogo handle well either make drogo seem way barbaric actually book accord specific scene book time throw fact tenderly ask permission mean really scene book end mutual agreement well much possible consider circumstance sex scene cersai brother pretty much dead book admit much pro costume prop scenery somewhat nice build show nice backdrop cool clothe though overall impression necessary scene rush important detail completely neglect character wrong age child fudge sex devolve barbaric act overpower woman nudity unnecessary overwhelmingly uneven full naked woman prop scenery nice whorehouse scene completely fabricate please read book understand many people read book angry read book think make quite obvious show drag overall game throne experience even know finish definitely back watch ridiculous adaptation last word actress play daenery beyond wrong actually feel bad make character book bleh

2	I'll be the first to admit that I was expecting a let down. Especially with Hollywood's recent track record of going ballistic on any IP they get their hands on.This then being a video-game adaptation, which are usually ranging from utter failure to let downs, the stage was set to this being just another one of the bunch.But apparently someone's been doing their homework, because they actually managed to create a pretty decent story in the Fallout lore, and also deliver a visually authentic experience to go hand in hand with the writing.Now this isn't the greatest show ever conceived by all means, but what it set out to deliver, it delivered it well.All the actors had done great job with their roles, special shout out to Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins as the stand-outs.The music was absolutely spot on, simply due to them being literally ripped out of the games, so the nostalgia hits any fan instantly.And last but not least, to avoid spoilers, the show full of a vault worth easter eggs for the fans to find.If they can keep this momentum and attention to detail for a few more seasons, this could actually go down as the best video-game adaptation to date.	first admit expect let especially hollywood recent track record go ballistic ip get hand video game adaptation usually range utter failure let down stage set another one bunch apparently someone homework actually manage create pretty decent story fallout lore also deliver visually authentic experience go hand hand write great show ever conceive mean set deliver deliver well actor do great job role special shout ella purnell walton goggin stand out music absolutely spot simply due literally rip game nostalgia hit fan instantly last least avoid spoiler show full vault worth easter egg fan find keep momentum attention detail season could actually go good video game adaptation date
2	Game of Thrones Where should one start? I can basically say that the series is well done. Great acting and casting.However, I must say that it can seem a bit long-winded. But if you keep watching the series, you will feel joy, and pain, and frustration.1 good thing about Game of Thrones is that the series goes almost like the real world, except for Dragons, which makes you mysteriously love dragons like that after a while.I'm a big fan of the characters, the way all the younger actors and older actors grow with age.I am especially a fan of the execution of effects and the music that is played together.I definitely also thought that the history and execution of the forged weapons, such as swords, daggers and axes/hammers, plus also has a great effect on the story and the character.The series is a must see, if you are a fan of fantasy and magical creatures.	game throne one start basically say series well do great act cast however must say seem bite long wind keep watch series feel joy pain frustration good thing game throne series go almost like real world except dragon make mysteriously love dragon like big fan character way young actor old actor grow age especially fan execution effect music play together definitely also think history execution forge weapon sword dagger ax hammer plus also great effect story character series must see fan fantasy magical creature
0	It starts OK, quite interesting at the beginning, degrades to bad, uninteresting, even banal very fast. At some point it doesn't even make sense anymore, it's just jiberis and clichés and special effects.I'm sure they could have done a better job out of the base material.It gets 4 stars only because I think some of the actors play their roles very well.I guess that unexpectedly killing some of your main characters doesn't always lead to a good show.And, BTW, I don't think it's OK to brutally kill children, or anyone for that matter, just because they happen to believe in aliens, as the creators of this show seem to believe.	start ok quite interest begin degrade bad uninteresting even banal fast point even make sense anymore jiberis clich special effect sure could do well job base material get star think actor play role well guess unexpectedly kill main character always lead good show btw think ok brutally kill child anyone matter happen believe alien creator show seem believe

He might have the excuse of past trauma, but even that was partially his fault for getting high and getting himself into a situation to be abused.I still have two episodes left to watch and I'm only going to watch them because I dislike leaving things unfinished, but this was a complete waste of my time and I really hope that no one else gets tricked into investing their precious time in watching this absolute abomination of a series.	rarely take time write review bad despite positive review get present different point view main character victim true pretty much come indulge someone obviously derange might excuse past trauma even partially fault get high get situation abuse still two episode leave watch go watch dislike leave thing unfinished complete waste time really hope one else get trick inv precious time watch absolute abomination series
0	One is a bad person who relies on betrayal, theft, and gambling in life, and the other is a lucky girl whose brain is controlled by hormones. The excessively disgusting male and female protagonists make people indifferent to their future development, and thus the entire drama is not worth caring about. To put it bluntly, that dog is more charming than the male and female protagonists. Not to mention the disgusting plot and setting, abandoning the plot of Fallout New Vegas and declaring Fallout 4 as the victory of the Brotherhood, a militaristic organization. But it has to be said that B's fans are really loyal, halo is fiercely criticized, radiation is praised, humorous.	one bad person rely betrayal theft gamble life lucky girl whose brain control hormone excessively disgust male female protagonist make people indifferent future development thus entire drama worth care put bluntly dog charm male female protagonist mention disgust plot set abandon plot fallout new vegas declare fallout victory brotherhood militaristic organization say b fan really loyal halo fiercely criticize radiation praise humorous

2	"I think the producers made a mistake in going monochrome with this series. I often like black and white films and shows from the early years of TV and cinema. Those were lit with that in mind. It does not work for this show.Italy of the era was meant to be beautiful and had a reputation for magical light. The characters talk about the beauty compared to New York. So why miss it out. This is not a radio show.The pace is very slow at first. Almost travelogue speed. The dialogue would have done a lot of cutting. Too many silences in the conversations as if they are meant to mean something. I kept wanting to shout ""get on with it""That said.... Silence... Once it gets going this a thrilling ride. Scott is great as Ripley. For such an unlikable character, I was rooting for him. Dakota Fanning was OK.Moritzo Lombardi as the Inspector in Rome was stunning to watch.

0	"The sci-fi elements are not primary, not secondary, not tertiary but quaternary to the plot.The primary element of the show is melodrama, poorly acted ESG-friendly melodrama. The vast majority of actors are rigid and diverse, except in China. In the Chinese settings they are portrayed to be Chinese and convey some emotions, but in the British settings they are portrayed to be ""diverse"" with the applicable current-day tropes.What else is there: rigid acting, long stares, nihilism and magic thinking.The story in itself makes no sense, no civilization would have flourished to reach the stage of interstellar travel on an unstable planet subject to pseudo-random cataclysms.If such a civilization could achieve interstellar travel, which requires them to travel 400 years, they should be able to seed the universe with a myriad of ships. The same myriad we were showed they would invade earth with.As for a chinese traitor being able to move freely on her own without repercussion on a top secret base in communist china and doom a whole planet on a few words... then recruiting followers to create a doomsday cult. Well, it's just fantasy.If the aliens are capable of some elements of mind control and control cameras on land but not satellites, then it makes no sense they would not have probed the minds of the population. So the reaction of the ""lord"" makes no sense.Let's also pass on the concept of the VR headset, ridiculous. There's more garbage in there like the converted tanker with an unprotected satellite dish, or the magical nanofibers that can cut anything without sustaining any damage. The scenes following the chopping of the ship are ridiculous on so many levels, better not think about it if you intend to like this type of production.This show is really tedious to watch."	sci fi element primary secondary tertiary quaternary plot primary element show melodrama poorly act esg friendly melodrama vast majority actor rigid diverse except china chinese setting portray chinese convey emotion british setting portray diverse applicable current day trope else rigid act long star nihilism magic think story make sense civilization would flourish reach stage interstellar travel unstable planet subject pseudo random cataclysm civilization could achieve interstellar travel require travel year able seed universe myriad ship myriad show would invade earth chinese traitor able move freely without repercussion top secret base communist china doom whole planet word recruit follower create doomsday cult well fantasy alien capable element mind control control cameras land satellite make sense would probe mind population reaction lord make sense let also pass concept vr headset ridiculous garbage like convert tanker unprotected satellite dish magical nanofiber cut anything without sustain damage scene follow chop ship ridiculous many level well think intend like type production show really tedious watch

And yet, once again, Amazon Studios continues their onslaught of cultural re-engineering instead of producing quality, independent entertainment. This is another mighty-woman first series that will appeal to 5% of a cry-baby population and turn-off the 95% that should be enjoying it. The first episode was just so ridiculously stupid in too many ways to count including the stupid '50s musical soundtrack that was so displaced I thought I was imagining it. So I thought, alright, that's a throwaway episode, maybe the second will be better. No. Now add to all that crud, racial retribution, and even more incongruent 50s musicalia.

2	Game of Thrones is undoubtly the biggest TV show project to it's date. It has the quality of a blockbuster movie FX, CGI and acting-wise, and even a better scenario and story telling because it's based on a very well-written books series, A Song of Ice and Fire.But everything changed after the show catched up to the book series it's based on, and producers started to write their own scenario. The quality of writing gradually declined after season 5 when this happened and hit rock bottom at the and of the show. The ending was terrificily dissapointing for most of the fans, and made literally no sense in my own opinion.It could be a show worth of 9 or even 10. But last seasons made the show a cliche-hub and even ridicilous sometimes. I'm sorry for the wasted opportunity.	game throne undoubtly big tv show project date quality blockbuster movie fx cgi act wise even well scenario story tell base well write book series song ice fire everything change show catch book series base producer start write scenario quality write gradually decline season happen hit rock bottom show end terrificily dissapointe fan make literally sense opinion could show worth even last season make show cliche hub even ridicilous sometimes sorry waste opportunity

The explanation of scientific ideas and concepts is easy to digest even to the audience not familiar with them.The scientist bunch, however... Dear scriptwriters, it's 2024. The general consensus today is that the scientists and nerds are not all insecure super geniuses who insert the F-word in every sentence to sound cool. (Thanks for not calling them ""boffins"" though.) The cast is OK but there is not much for them to play with.The cast that is given less cardboard characters like Rosalind Chao, Liam Cunningham, and in particular, Benedict Wong really shine.

2	Although the series starts with a very good tempo at the beginning, it connects a lot after a certain time, and the change of the cast reduces the interest in looking at the screen. Still, I don't know how much it would be right to criticize the series, which has watched countless seasons and so many episodes. DETAIL: Since the tempo of relationship triangles is very supportive to a certain extent in the functioning of the series, a great deficiency begins when the squad changes. Then I think the biggest problem is that mass injuries, adrenaline in the hospital is missing, and the biggest shortcomings and worst intrigues do not suit the series so well that they drive people away and cause the series to end after all these seasons.	although series start good tempo begin connect lot certain time change cast reduce interest look screen still know much would right criticize series watch countless season many episode detail since tempo relationship triangle supportive certain extent function series great deficiency begin squad change think big problem mass injury adrenaline hospital miss big shortcoming bad intrigue suit series well drive people away cause series end season
1	The build up through the first 4-5 episodes lines this series up for a great tale that leaves one expecting more than it delivers.The story relies on flashbacks and jumps to present to build a very good narrative. This narrative builds to a few interesting twists and flashpoints that becomes slower towards the ending episodes.Some epic and stunning scenes however make this a worthwhile watch. Casting is very good, performances are believable and the entire story leaves one hoping to see more of this story to be made by the end.Definitely a great Sci Fi offering mixed with mystery and fantasy with a dose of factual and even historical context. *(referencing the WOW! Signal, and starting during the cultural revolution in China).Obviously targeted towards nerds and sci fi geeks with heavy references to Nano tech, particle physics and astronomical science fields interwoven with dimensional theoretic research and Virtual reality gaming. Well made and at times intensely interesting, while having long moments of slow dialogue. Overall worth a 7/10.	build first episode line series great tale leave one expect deliver story rely flashback jump present build good narrative narrative build interest twist flashpoint become slow towards end episode epic stun scene however make worthwhile watch cast good performance believable entire story leave one hop see story make end definitely great sci fi offer mix mystery fantasy dose factual even historical context reference wow signal start cultural revolution china obviously target towards nerd sci fi geek heavy reference nano tech particle physics astronomical science field interweave dimensional theoretic research virtual reality game well make time intensely interest long moment slow dialogue overall worth
1	This is supposed to be a medical show like House, St Elsewhere, Trapper John , Etc. But it is really a soap opera based on the intertwined love affairs of all the resident and intern doctors who just are so horny they love each other long time.They constantly compromise each others lives by having unprofessional and unwise relationships that would make most alley cats jealous. The very first show starts the viewer down the path of unholy sex romps with our lovely starlet the harlot hooking up with a total stranger who quickly becomes her main fixation and unshakable love drug. The other cast members quickly fall in to the bed'em don't wed'em routine and this becomes a little too much of the focus.That being said, the show is still riveting with tremendous periods of intense drama that leaves you needing more, just like the sex starved cast members. The shoot from the hips diagnosis, and exploratory surgeries, are often a little under researched and casual compared to House and his crew's 58 minute workups. Still in many ways the show is more believable than House, and Merideth Grey is much easier to take in large doses than Greg House.The first two seasons are on DVD and I would recommend anyone wanting to give the show an honest chance, rent or buy them and start in order. There is a tremendous amount of character development that should not be missed.Despite my feelings about the loose sex and love interest, I think the show is a hit well worthy of all the accolades it has received. I also think the cast is about as talented as any show ever put together when you examine them as a whole.	suppose medical show like house st elsewhere trapper john etc really soap opera base intertwine love affair resident intern doctor horny love long time constantly compromise other live unprofessional unwise relationship would make alley cat jealous first show start view path unholy sex romp lovely starlet harlot hook total stranger quickly become main fixation unshakable love drug cast member quickly fall bed em we d em routine become little much focus say show still rivet tremendous period intense drama leave need like sex starve cast member shoot hip diagnosis exploratory surgery often little research casual compare house crew minute workup still many way show believable house merideth grey much easy take large dose greg house first two season dvd would recommend anyone want give show honest chance rent buy start order tremendous amount character development miss despite feel loose sex love interest think show hit well worthy accolade receive also think cast talented show ever put together examine whole

I came with mixed expectations. After all, Netflix did a fairly good job with Altered Carbon, right? Ok NOOOOO... I am sorely dissapointed, to put it politely. Just no respect with the source material, it is not enough to keep some plot points, it is the overall concept, the beauty of the narration, the science, everything!. To convert it to a soap opear is just a capita sin. In a previous review I read ""Just enough changes to make it more digestible for a TV audience"". Translation: ""just dumbed down for a stupider audience"", like it is a good thing. Since when a TV audience is less intelligent than book readers? You are making a TV series, you have all the time in the world to explain everything! And of course, the mandatory changes in genders and races, so the appropiate equality quota is fulfilled.

1	Excellent acting, very good story lines, almost as good as E.R.. Not as hyper nor hectic as theirs, which is why I thought I would like it. I've always liked medical dramas.However, these good story lines are muddled with so much sex I can't remember who slept with whom. If I thought for a minute that anyone carving me up was that distracted by their sex life, I'd find another surgeon. Thank goodness this is just TV and not reality.Add to that the director's decision to incorporate the most inane, distracting, really loud muzak in almost every scene and you have a show that really isn't worth watching. I can't hear the dialog for the muzak.Note to director: CUT THE MUZAK. If you'll just do that one thing I'll keep watching.	excellent act good story line almost good e r hyper hectic think would like always like medical drama however good story line muddle much sex remember sleep think minute anyone carve distract sex life find another surgeon thank goodness tv reality add director decision incorporate inane distract really loud muzak almost every scene show really worth watch hear dialog muzak note director cut muzak one thing keep watch

It could've been legendary if they stopped at the right moment of time.	stop watch th season get bore repetitive many good character leave show though keep go elien pompeo leave find something new pursue career could legendary stop right moment time
2	Some Americans are complaining about the use of English to describe discussions in Portuguese. This is the norm for many period shows. English in an English accent is typically used.The show obviously needs to skip parts, but the tension is really described in both books much better, , Clavels Shogun and the original Pilot's Samurai William (a must read). Almost 500,000 Japanese had converted to Christianity and the Portuguese had been wrecking homogeneity of Japanese culture. Almost 30% of the Daimiyos had converted and had dual loyalties. They were causing havoc in Japan.In Samurai William the politics were even better described even between Spanish and Portuguese. The pope had given Japan to Portugal but the Spanish using the earlier Tordesilas treaty onsidered Japan theirs too.Lastly the show does miss the mastery of languages William/ John is described as knowing in the book. Fluent in English, Dutch, Portuguese and later mastery of Japanese.The acting of the Japanese characters is top notch , the European characters well seems to be a bit over the top.	americans complain use english describe discussion portuguese norm many period show english english accent typically use show obviously need skip part tension really describe book much well clavel shogun original pilot samurai william must read almost japanese convert christianity portuguese wreck homogeneity japanese culture almost daimiyos convert dual loyalty cause havoc japan samurai william politics even well describe even spanish portuguese pope give japan portugal spanish use early tordesilas treaty onsidere japan lastly show miss mastery language william john describe know book fluent english dutch portuguese later mastery japanese act japanese character top notch european character well seem bite top
2	The environment, characters, music - everything is there.It's hard to complain about the show, because it is essentially a fallout game moved to a Tv-show.Having said that, in a game I can have more patience with some parts of the storytelling not matching up to others. There is so much more to a game than the script that plays in.But in a Tv-show, it doesn't work to have part of the show feel unengaging or questionable at times. Every minute counts.The truth is that most of the time I am loving the show. Others I cringe, or want to skip, because frankly they aren't keeping my interest, or I'm not feeling the writing.So far it also lacks moments that are truly inspiring that will stay with me for years to come.It is a great addition to the latest trend of games turned shows being good. But it doesn't belong with the greats so far.A solid 8.	environment character music everything hard complain show essentially fallout game move tv show say game patience part storytelling match other much game script play tv show work part show feel unengage questionable time every minute count truth time love show other cringe want skip frankly keep interest feel write far also lack moment truly inspire stay year come great addition late trend game turn show good belong great far solid

2	Created by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner and its cast includes Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Walton Goggins, Kyle MacLachlan and Moises Arias.SynopsisBased on one of the most important video game sagas of all time, it is the story of the haves and the have-nots in a world where there is practically nothing left to have. 200 years after the apocalypse, the peaceful inhabitants of the luxury lodges are forced to return to the irradiated hell left behind by their ancestors and are shocked to discover that an incredibly complex, joyfully strange and very violent universe awaits them.If The Last Us gave us some hope that video game adaptations would finally manage to be faithful to their origin, today Amazon Studios is present with its spectacular adaptation of the popular game Fallout. The studio takes all the laurels under the eaves of its two creators, Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner, who faithfully and satisfactorily adapt this entire post-apocalyptic world that represents the complexity in which the entire story takes place after Fallout.A careful and well-thought-out work so as not to lose any of the blood that made the video game so popular, but also without forgetting that it is a television adaptation and that it must also capture a neutral audience. That work is done correctly where both fans of the game and viewers who connect with the story for the first time can enjoy a forceful, concise and well-written series, which makes you glued to the screen chapter after chapter without never lose the emotion of what we are seeing and the sensations that everything is increasing in satisfaction.The affection with which its creators take the series is essential for us to have a result that lives up to the satisfaction it generates. The dose with which they offer us humor, drama, war, survival and many more details in which the series surprises is a perfect cocktail to have a result that at times comes to surprise with its own ability to end up conquering known and unknown alike.Each chapter generates a successful journey through the action, social reflections and constant plot twists that in the hands of its inspired directors we obtain refined and notable entertainment from Amazon. The series is very intelligent when it comes to measuring each substance to be delivered so as not to exceed the formulas that end up turning the series into something meaningless. It is a series well measured in every detail and in each new option to be delivered, which means that it always remains even and never falters in pace, entertainment and emotion.A perfectly chosen cast where no one clashes and each one gives their stamp to their already popular characters. Having Walton Goggins with his Western attitude is the greatest possible pleasure, but also having a charming Ella Purnell as the great protagonist is also a delight, reflecting that her casting was totally a success in each of her performers.A series that clearly becomes one of the best so far in 2024 and without a doubt earns its place in the royalty of great video game adaptations to the small screen. Both the most fanatical and those looking for novelty will be totally pleased with a powerful proposal that makes use of their entire budget and their creative minds behind it. It is a series that you should see even if you do not know the game or are not a fan, because the series works from beginning to end with a forcefulness that does not give you room to doubt it at any moment and that is being faced with a great job that deserves to be appreciated by everyone.The Fallout universe is welcome to adaptation royalty.	create geneva robertson dworet graham wagner cast include ella purnell aaron moten walton goggin kyle maclachlan moises arias synopsisbase one important video game sagas time story have not world practically nothing leave year apocalypse peaceful inhabitant luxury lodge force return irradiate hell leave behind ancestor shock discover incredibly complex joyfully strange violent universe await last we give we hope video game adaptation would finally manage faithful origin today amazon studio present spectacular adaptation popular game fallout studio take laurel eave two creator geneva robertson dworet graham wagner faithfully satisfactorily adapt entire post apocalyptic world represent complexity entire story take place fallout careful well think work lose blood make video game popular also without forget television adaptation must also capture neutral audience work do correctly fan game viewer connect story first time enjoy forceful concise well write series make glue screen chapter chapter without never lose emotion see sensation everything increase satisfaction affection creator take series essential us result live satisfaction generate dose offer we humor drama war survival many detail series surprise perfect cocktail result time come surprise ability end conquer know unknown alike chapter generate successful journey action social reflection constant plot twist hand inspire director obtain refine notable entertainment amazon series intelligent come measure substance deliver exceed formula end turn series something meaningless series well measure every detail new option deliver mean always remain even never falter pace entertainment emotion perfectly choose cast one clash one give stamp already popular character walton goggin western attitude great possible pleasure also charm ella purnell great protagonist also delight reflect cast totally success performer series clearly become one well far without doubt earn place royalty great video game adaptation small screen fanatical look novelty totally please powerful proposal make use entire budget creative mind behind series see even know game fan series work begin end forcefulness give room doubt moment face great job deserve appreciate everyone fallout universe welcome adaptation royalty
2	I was more than happy to see a modern adaptation of the famous books by Patricia Highsmith. The 2 movies of the past can't complete these story and i hope that more cinematographers accept the challenge and adapt this wonderful character. The photography is superb, it makes you want to stop the tv and watch the scene, music is melancholic and moody, casting is very smart and performances are beautiful. For me, if you have read the books you know that Tom Ripley isn't queer but for some reason nowadays he HAS to be. The first movie chose to present Tom as a homosexual mostly because it lacked the patience and will to present correctly his infatuation with Dickie and now this series is flirting with the term 'queer', mentioned at least 35 times but I suppose it's ok because ...Netflix. Read the books if you liked this, the depth of this characters is beyond this presentation for 'modern audiences'.	happy see modern adaptation famous book patricia highsmith movie past complete story hope cinematographer accept challenge adapt wonderful character photography superb make want stop tv watch scene music melancholic moody cast smart performance beautiful read book know tom ripley queer reason nowadays first movie choose present tom homosexual mostly lack patience present correctly infatuation dickie series flirt term queer mention least time suppose ok netflix read book like depth character beyond presentation modern audience
1	This series had the potential to become something truly great by the end and open a new chapter in the world of television. Sadly, the eighth season completely ruined the whole series, including its characters, its world and its story.I won't mention any spoilers here, but if you really want to watch this series, be prepared for a gigantic disappointment at the journey's end. You'll watch one of the greatest series burn down in huge flames.If I have to rate each seasons individually, here's how I would rank them:Season 1-4: These are definitely the most complex, most layered seasons with the highest level of scriptwriting. Excellent dialogues, pacing, character developments, narrative twists, etc. Mainly because at this time the writer of the books was still involved in the making of the series and the series were heavily build upon the books. The absolute best is Season 4 because it had the best character interactions and story arcs and it also had some of the most memorable moments in the series.Season 5 is a mixed bag. It has the heavily disliked Dorne plotline and overall, most episodes in it while are okay, they don't move the story forward in any meaningful way, they often just feel like fillers. But at the same time, the last four episodes are extremely good and interesting, mainly Hardhome, which is arguably one of the best episodes in the series (and also my personal favourite along with the ninth episode of the sixth season).Season 6 is fantastic and in some ways, it's maybe the best along with Season 4. But it's hard to properly judge it, because despite some of its darker moments, it feels rather optimistic and uplifting, and maybe because of it, for some people, it won't really feel like Game of Thrones. But everything that happens in this season happens for a reason and everything is earned, twists and moments don't feel cheap or forced, they feel natural, there are no filler episodes and the overall pacing is great.Season 7 is a mixed bag, similarly to Season 5. One half of it is great, the other half is not so much. But as opposed to Season 5, in this case, the first half (first three episodes) are the good ones, and the later episodes are the bad ones. The first three episodes are very dialogue-heavy and character-centric and they feel very well written and satisfying, they feel a natural continuation of the story and quality of Season 6. But after that, the logic gets completely thrown out of the window, everything starts to happen so fast and basically, Game of Thrones' real downfall starts from here.Season 8 is a monumental disappointment. It subverts your expectations in the worst possible ways, things happen purely for shock value instead of happening because of the natural progression of the story. Character arcs get thrown completely out of the window, there are tons of deus ex machina moments, main characters wear plot armor and they are practically invincible. Things happen way too fast therefore there isn't enough time to really build up certain scenes in an intelligent and beleivable manner and scenes that are supposed evoke a certain feeling from the viewers (for example, sadness) evoke a totally different feeling instead (they make the viewers laugh). There are a lot of forced and artificial drama, the episodes are extremely inconsistent in a lot of ways, not just compared to the previous' seasons episodes, but compared only to other Season 8 episodes too. The biggest victim of Season 8 is Game of Thrones itself.	series potential become something truly great end open new chapter world television sadly eighth season completely ruin whole series include character world story mention spoiler really want watch series prepare gigantic disappointment journey end watch one great series burn huge flame rate season individually would rank season definitely complex layer season high level scriptwrite excellent dialogue pace character development narrative twist etc mainly time writer book still involve make series series heavily build upon book absolute good season good character interaction story arc also memorable moment series season mix bag heavily dislike dorne plotline overall episode okay move story forward meaningful way often feel like filler time last four episode extremely good interest mainly hardhome arguably one good episode series also personal favourite along ninth episode sixth season season fantastic way maybe good along season hard properly judge despite dark moment feel rather optimistic uplift maybe people really feel like game throne everything happen season happen reason everything earn twist moment feel cheap force feel natural filler episode overall pace great season mix bag similarly season one half great half much oppose season case first half first three episode good one later episode bad one first three episode dialogue heavy character centric feel well write satisfy feel natural continuation story quality season logic get completely throw window everything start happen fast basically game throne real downfall start season monumental disappointment subvert expectation bad possible way thing happen purely shock value instead happen natural progression story character arc get throw completely window ton deus ex machina moment main character wear plot armor practically invincible thing happen way fast therefore enough time really build certain scene intelligent beleivable manner scene suppose evoke certain feel viewer example sadness evoke totally different feel instead make viewer laugh lot force artificial drama episode extremely inconsistent lot way compare previous season episode compare season episode big victim season game throne
2	Not an exact copy of the book. The program has more space for the interpersonal relationships adding depth to the characters that together look like a scene from Friends.I also liked the scientific accuracy, the mix of fast and slow pace, and perhaps the most important of all is that they don't assume the viewer is stupid.On the downside there are a lot of graphic scenes, the alien (ai) behavior reminded me very much of behavior of people on the spectrum. And I feel insulted from the association with bad/evil/scare.This is a surprise because otherwise they have put so much effort to make the cast diverse.	exact copy book program space interpersonal relationship add depth character together look like scene friend also like scientific accuracy mix fast slow pace perhaps important assume viewer stupid downside lot graphic scene alien ai behavior remind much behavior people spectrum feel insult association bad evil scare surprise otherwise put much effort make cast diverse
0	It's incredibly confounding how such a run of the mill show -- that repeats and repeats and repeats the SAME, tired, storylines, and just combines them with different backstories -- has now been on for years and years and years.I give the writers some credit for getting away with this repetitive nonsense (hence the three stars) but still -- how can people waste YEARS of their lives watching this unoriginal pablum?I guess the answer can be found in some of the higher-rated reviews, where brain-dead viewers refer to the actor's characters by NAME, as if they're real people. Newflash, they're NOT.Reminds me of stories Larry Hagman used to tell, about how viewers of Dallas used to actually attack him in airports, asking him why he left SUE-ELLEN? :)Sigh...	incredibly confound run mill show repeat repeat repeat tire storyline combine different backstorie year year year give writer credit get away repetitive nonsense hence three star still people waste year live watch unoriginal pablum guess answer find high rat review brain dead viewer refer actor character name real people newflash remind story larry hagman use tell viewer dallas use actually attack airport ask leave sue ellen sigh

There's not a episode that goes by where lucy is not hung up on Bradford any time they showed her is was basically all about him🙄 which I feel diminished her character, because she worked so hard to become a P2.

0	Good show. Very bad Fallout show. The show doesn't adhere to Fallout lore and they don't understand how the world works. The characters have a very obvious amount of makeup. Why would people with a finite amount of resources use them for makeup to make themselves look pretty. The power armor very obviously had no weight to them which made the added sounds even more jarring. They put fat people in the vault where they have regimented food. The raiders blow up a bomb with remote tech. The outfits are aways clean. Its the same with the locations they go to. Everyone and everywhere is too clean. They seem have forgotten this is post apocalypse. The world and people in the show doesn't look or act like atomic fallout has happened, they really mention rads and they don't encounter any radiation in the irradiated wasteland.	good show bad fallout show show adhere fallout lore understand world work character obvious amount makeup would people finite amount resource use makeup make look pretty power armor obviously weight make add sound even jar put fat people vault regiment food raider blow bomb remote tech outfit away clean location go everyone everywhere clean seem forget post apocalypse world people show look act like atomic fallout happen really mention rad encounter radiation irradiate wasteland

0	"This has to be the worst adaptation I've ever laid eyes on, if one could even call it that. Quite literally, everything is changed for the worse, even the simplest details that did not need a change. I'm not even talking about ""westernization"" of the plot, like changing the character names, the place that the story takes place etc. Think about any scene in the series and it's either completely different in the books, or it doesn't even exist. The whole concept of ""countdown"" is way too simplified and the entire suspense of it is gone. It wasn't long ago that we had 24 episode per season series, and a lot of the plot that's cut doesn't even require any CGI. Ye Wenjie has almost completely different personality. Everything that makes Shi Qiang, Da Shi is competely gone, well other than the fact that he smokes a lot. I suppose our brilliant producers thought that smoking a lot is enough personality trait. There are so many things I could write just from the first episode alone but what's the point.I strongly suggest everyone to not watch this piece of garbage, either read the books or just spend your time on something else altogether.Finally, remember these names: David Benioff, D. B. Weiss.Do not ever forget them, and avoid everything like a plague with their name on it. They are the masters of alchemy, except instead of transmuting common metals to gold, they transmute gold to a pile of worthless dust. They must be the worst producers of this century."	bad adaptation ever lie eye one could even call quite literally everything change bad even simple detail need change even talk westernization plot like change character name place story take place etc think scene series either completely different book even exist whole concept countdown way simplify entire suspense go long ago episode per season series lot plot cut even require cgi ye wenjie almost completely different personality everything make shi qiang da shi competely go well fact smoke lot suppose brilliant producer think smoke lot enough personality trait many thing could write first episode alone point strongly suggest everyone watch piece garbage either read book spend time something else altogether finally remember name david benioff b weiss ever forget avoid everything like plague name master alchemy except instead transmute common metal gold transmute gold pile worthless dust must bad producer century
0	All I ever wanted was to get a series of one of my most beloved sci-fi Novels. Is that to much to ask? The characters are very two dimensional and unfortunately, careless. You don't feel like they actually understand the gravity of the situation they are in. This, however, is not due to poor acting, no, it is thanks to terrible writing on behalf of the directors. Thomas Wade as well has been ruined even though the casting wasn't to far of with what I could imagine him looking like. On one hand the series tries to stick to the novels while on the other it actively rebels against them. I guess it had a few good moments. For example the talks between the Trisolarans (I refuse to call them anything else than that) and Evans were very tense and made them seem more threatening. I don't know what else to say really, this is sad.	ever want get series one beloved sci fi novel much ask character two dimensional unfortunately careless feel like actually understand gravity situation however due poor act thank terrible write behalf director thomas wade well ruin even though cast far could imagine look like one hand series try stick novel actively rebel guess good moment example talk trisolaran refuse call anything else evan tense make seem threaten know else say really sad
2	"The show is beautifully shot and the story is very compelling. The Japanese cast includes some truly heavy hitters (Hiroyuki Sanada and Tadanobu Asano are legends, imo).The only thing that brings it down slightly for me is the terrible, hammy overacting of Cosmo Jarvis. I don't know if it's the script that was written for him or what, but his performance just comes off as so...unwatchable. It's like he's trying to do a third-rate channeling of Tom Hardy (who by the way would have been fantastic in this role, in my opinion). Every time Blackthorne opens his mouth I just want to cringe.Shogun is still very much worth watching because thankfully, Blackthorne is just one small part of an otherwise excellent ensemble cast. This show runs laps around ""House of the Dragon"" or any other recent period limited drama."	show beautifully shoot story compel japanese cast include truly heavy hitter hiroyuki sanada tadanobu asano legend imo thing bring slightly terrible hammy overact cosmo jarvis know script write performance come unwatchable like try third rate channel tom hardy way would fantastic role opinion every time blackthorne open mouth want cringe shogun still much worth watch thankfully blackthorne one small part otherwise excellent ensemble cast show run lap around house dragon recent period limit drama
0	Nathan did his thing and was one of the few positive things about the show. However, the show lacked pace as it jumped from scene to scene with a lack of continuity. I could watch future episodes but won't because the characters are such prototypes that you can't possibly care about them, Like the tough cop who becomes instantly weepy at the sight of his wife who he hasn't seen in a year. Um, okay but there is no why. Totally unrealistic but not more than a petite cop getting the best of a big guy in a sidewalk tussle. Really? A complete disappointment filled with cliches you've seen many times before.	nathan thing one positive thing show however show lack pace jump scene scene lack continuity could watch future episode character prototype possibly care like tough cop become instantly weepy sight wife see year um okay totally unrealistic petite cop get well big guy sidewalk tussle really complete disappointment fill cliche see many time
0	The new series take a lot of liberty in the story telling unlike the book or the original 80s series. As I have read and seen those, I can explain to my spouse and kids what is happening. Although the first episodes did follow the book closely, more and more it deviates on important events. As if the budget would not allow further elaboration. Without me explaining to my family what is happening, I doubt whether they can actually understand what is exactly going on and who is who. Also the bad guys are not so devious as in the book or the original series. The scenes, costumes, sword dueling and so on are very good and give a nice view of feudal Japan. It is a good series to watch but not as epic as the original series. As such I do not understand the very high rating.	new series take lot liberty story tell unlike book original series read see explain spouse kid happen although first episode follow book closely deviate important event budget would allow elaboration without explain family happen doubt whether actually understand exactly go also bad guy devious book original series scenes costume sword duel good give nice view feudal japan good series watch epic original series understand high rat
1	I liked watching for the first 2-3 seasons, without knowing I was in season 3. But once I look at it there are a lot episodes in each season, and there are a lot of seasons too. I felt kind of bored, may be because I binge watched like 5 seasons in 3 weeks, but also it is getting too emotional for a series which I expected more medical things.... I am usually strong heart and minded, but watching lot of grey's anatomy built depression during nights and in the sleep. Do not watch a lot episodes in a day.... That's my recommendation... I stopped watching after season 5, may be someday I watch others....	like watch first season without know season look lot episode season lot season feel kind bore may binge watch like season week also get emotional series expect medical thing usually strong heart mind watch lot grey anatomy build depression night sleep watch lot episode day recommendation stop watch season may someday watch other
0	My rating of this show is low as found boring. I have read the book and loved it and series does not grasp even a fraction of that. The korean dramas are so popular because they show the content with emotions in details and keep you involved. Don't know why they had to run a bullet train here, many more episodes could had been added. Missed many important events like Yabushige's suicide and the events leading upto it. They did go in depth of Mariko and Pilot's emotional relationship. Did not show Toranaga decision of burning Anjin ships. Missed out on showing the inter personal relations between characters, also missed out on showing the real political issues and role of religion in that era and lastly forget to mention the conclusion, result of the war which was mentioned in the book.	rat show low find bore read book love series grasp even fraction korean drama popular show content emotion detail keep involve know run bullet train many episode could add miss many important event like yabushige suicide event lead upto go depth mariko pilot emotional relationship show toranaga decision burn anjin ship miss show inter personal relation character also miss show real political issue role religion era lastly forget mention conclusion result war mention book

Secondly,in the previous season she called her mother a whore,though this is she herself who sleeps with every man she feels like and hurts every body's feelings and ruins others lives.And after all she justifies herself!she thinks she's a saint!she's the most promiscuous character I've ever seen in my life. It's really a pity that such an invidious character is the leading role of this really good movie.

I don't need to be watching it on one of my favorite shows that I view to get away from reality. Also I get that they're trying to make people aware of what goes on in the world but literally you don't need to shove it down our throats and try to squeeze legit every political view in at all times. This show used to be my favorite but this latest season has tanked all good memories it holds. Absolute trash.

A lot of the charcters especially the oxford 5 made little sense and seemed just to be there to somehow ground us, I guess. Just bored me. All these scientist are supposed to be the best in the world and there all in their late 20's? I never read the book so cant comment on how well it follows it. Im suprised how much information seems left out though. Half way through I was like, they going to need several more series of this to draw it together hopefully.	like enough binge watch premise great interest think end lot question show lie lot charcter especially oxford make little sense seem somehow grind we guess bore scientist suppose good world late never read book can not comment well follow I m suprise much information seem leave though half way like go need several series draw together hopefully
0	I do not understand all the hype for this show. The first season is more about porn than anything else. Later that kinda fades away, and when characters are not walking naked it's actually s decent show. But that's it, i don't see anything special about it.EDIT: Last season ruined the few things that the show had going for it. It did not get one star simply because there were interesting episodes in a few seasons so i couldn't get muself to do it. But it deserves one star. Writing in last few seasons is simply horrible.	understand hype show first season porn anything else later kinda fade away character walk naked actually decent show see anything special edit last season ruin thing show go get one star simply interest episode season get muself deserve one star write last season simply horrible

0	When I started watching this, it seemed like it would be a really good show. Is each episode went on I got more and more frustrated with the writing and the actual storyline. If this was actually based on a real story and a person was an accused stalker of multiple people and started stalking you the cops would definitely be all over this but instead they ignore the situation they ignore the guy having the problem and even after he is physically assaulted by her nothing happens. It seems completely unrealistic. The main character is also frustrating in his weird obsession with his stalker and his laziness to do anything about it. I don't feel anything for this main character except apathy after watching every episode of this show. It also makes the police department in any country, look useless. For me this storyline while entertaining, is so unrealistic in this day and age.	start watch seem like would really good show episode go get frustrate write actual storyline actually base real story person accuse stalker multiple people start stalk cop would definitely instead ignore situation ignore guy problem even physically assault nothing happen seem completely unrealistic main character also frustrate weird obsession stalker laziness anything feel anything main character except apathy watch every episode show also make police department country look useless storyline entertain unrealistic day age
2	I played all the Fallout games and had a great time watching it! There are references to every game in the series, so people who have played at least one game will get their share of the nostalgia cake.The only thing that bothered me was the typical American-racial convention of the series, which in itself doesn't bother me, there is and must be this American vibe throughout Fallout because that's what this game is based on, BUT that makes it easy to guess what's going to happen, e.g. In the first episode, the husband is white, so I already knew it was going to be bad, although when I saw him, I thought he was either a drug addict or a violent person. But then the frame showed that everyone was dirty and cut up and I already knew who they were, because people from the crypt don't look like that, maybe they were subjected to some kind of experiment.Apart from this small stumble, the series is very well made, the set designers did a great job looking at the locations and their filling, although they were probably afraid to play more aggressively with the light. The actors played well, where Moises Arias, Walton Goggins and Jon Daly, definitely the best.Overall, a very good series!	play fallout game great time watch reference every game series people play least one game get share nostalgia cake thing bother typical american racial convention series bother must american vibe throughout fallout game base make easy guess go happen e g first episode husband white already know go bad although saw think either drug addict violent person frame show everyone dirty cut already know people crypt look like maybe subject kind experiment apart small stumble series well make set designer great job look location fill although probably afraid play aggressively light actor play well moises arias walton goggin jon daly definitely good overall good series
1	"8 for the first two seasons, 6 for the third one (more are not available in my country at the moment).This is the story of three rookies in the LAPD. Being in his fourties, officer Nolan is the oldest one. This role was the reason I started to watch the series. I am above 50 and I just began a ""new life"" as a paramedic, so I somehow felt connected to another old rookie.I did not expect this series to be so funny, but it is. To be honest, in the beginning it is quite silly. It stays funny, but the longer it goes, the more serious approaches will develop.I think that the lead character would have been perfect for Jason Bateman, but Nathan Fillian does his job well. For me the star of this series is Melissa O'Neill though. She plays rookie officer Chen in such a charming and irresistible way, you are forced to feel with her (and she's having a rough ride)."	first two season third one available country moment story three rookie lapd fourties officer nolan old one role reason start watch series begin new life paramedic somehow feel connect another old rookie expect series funny honest begin quite silly stay funny long go serious approach develop think lead character would perfect jason bateman nathan fillian job well star series melissa neill though play rookie officer chen charm irresistible way force feel rough ride
1	It is the ancient and feudal Japan in the era of the Discoveries. There was a huge effort on having the show speaking Japanese, with Japanese actors and sets that turn the story very authentic. However, as Portuguese, I was expecting to see the same effort, since in the show the Japanese are trading with the Portuguese; but no, not even a Portuguese word is spoken even though they are supposedly speaking Portuguese. So, since the protagonist is English and speaks Portuguese, all those dialogs are in English or Japanese, affecting the comprehension of the story. They should have done the same as in Vikings, an excellent reference they should have followed: at least some dialogs should start in Portuguese so that the story could be better understood. Also, there are some twists and details that make the understanding of the whole plot a little hard. Even though it is a show worth watching.	ancient feudal japan era discovery huge effort show speak japanese japanese actor set turn story authentic however portuguese expect see effort since show japanese trade portuguese even portuguese word speak even though supposedly speak portuguese since protagonist english speak portuguese dialog english japanese affect comprehension story do viking excellent reference follow least dialog start portuguese story could well understand also twist detail make understand whole plot little hard even though show worth watch
0	"The first two seasons were good, but the over-the-top heroics in season 3 have become comical, reminds me of the old 60's Batman show. POW! ZAP! ZOWIE! The scene where Nila single handedly delivers her own baby, cuts the cord, cleans it, wraps it in a blankie while disarming/overpowering/arresting the armed bad guy (all within the space of a few of minutes), then says ""by the way, its a girl."" We laughed until we had tears. Show is becoming rediculous. The new rookie girl is becoming tedious with her nonstop supposed spiritual hoodoo. I believe a real police TO would be fired for allowing this little twit to do the stuff she has done because of her ""spirituality"" or whatever it is supposed to be. Its not interesting or inspiring, its just stupid. I hope the writers will improve the current downward trajectory before it completely crashes and burns, make The Rookie watchable again. They proved in season 2 that they can deftly handle social issues without resorting to these nonstop cliches and super hero cops."	first two season good top heroic season become comical remind old batman show pow zap zowie scene nila single handedly deliver baby cut cord clean wrap blankie disarm overpower arrest arm bad guy within space minute say way girl laugh tear show become rediculous new rookie girl become tedious nonstop suppose spiritual hoodoo believe real police would fire allow little twit stuff do spirituality whatever suppose interest inspire stupid hope writer improve current downward trajectory completely crash burn make rookie watchable prove season deftly handle social issue without resort nonstop cliche super hero cop
2	This is so far my favourite TV series where medicine is involved. There's a lot of drama in lives of doctors. You can learn so much and maybe become braver like me if you ever need to go on some surgery.	far favourite tv series medicine involve lot drama live doctor learn much maybe become braver like ever need go surgery
2	This show was brilliant. It tells a story in which we see two severely wounded souls build a strange and damaging relationship, yet it's so much more than that. All the characters were very complex and interesting, with the help of the extremely talented actors, who really did their characters justice and managed to portrait mentall illness and trauma excellently. It's a very intense series with various sensitive and untouchable topics and it really makes the viewer feel deeply and gives a very sour aftertaste. The show keeps you at the edge of your seat and makes you feel a whirlwind of emotions. I enjoyed every second of this series and loved everything down to the fantastic choice of music, the shocking twists, and obviously the show-stopping ending. The show affectes you and is definitely that impactful that it alters the way you view life and makes you realize the power of the human mind. This was definitely a hard watch but we rarely get Television content as good as this, so if you can handle tough scenes, you definitely need to watch this.	show brilliant tell story see two severely wound soul build strange damage relationship yet much character complex interest help extremely talented actor really character justice manage portrait mentall illness trauma excellently intense series various sensitive untouchable topic really make viewer feel deeply give sour aftertaste show keep edge seat make feel whirlwind emotion enjoy every second series love everything fantastic choice music shock twist obviously show stop end show affect definitely impactful alter way view life make realize power human mind definitely hard watch rarely get television content good handle tough scene definitely need watch
2	I am a Chinese and I read the novels in my college years about 15 years ago. Well let's be straight this is not for you if you can't stand any deviations being made in a TV show adapted from books. However, I found myself quite enjoying the watching although at the very two episodes it was a bit challenging to know who is WHO, which became clear after 3 episodes.Let's admit it there would be no way to properly make someone feel exactly how they felt the first time they read a great novel (TLOTR is one great exception here, Long Live Saint Peter). This Netflix version, however, is NOT BAD. The way it connects the characters can be a little bit too intentional but it's not a bad adoption. I like seeing how they improved the chemistry between Chen Xin and Yun Tian Ming and their story in season one here is one of the highlights.All I want to say is I am OK with adaption so long it make sense logically. In this case, Netflix version did a good job.	chinese read novel college year year ago well let straight stand deviation make tv show adapt book however find quite enjoy watch although two episode bite challenge know become clear episode let admit would way properly make someone feel exactly feel first time read great novel tlotr one great exception long live saint peter netflix version however bad way connect character little bite intentional bad adoption like see improve chemistry chen xin yun tian ming story season one one highlight want say ok adaption long make sense logically case netflix version good job

2	This was a pleasant surprise! I really liked this adaptation, which I watched over the weekend. Much better than most science fiction series. The visuals are captivating and the characters are convincingly portrayed with deep emotions. Yes, the movie diverges from the book. The book was written from a Chinese point of view, and most of this series takes place in England, with different characters. But that doesn't affect the story at all.The nice thing about Cixin Liu, the book's author, is his exploration of ideas about our future and possible encounters with alien life, that has a level of technology far exceeding ours. His work shows he's a great admirer of the grandmaster of SF, Isaac Asimov, and he gives us completely new visions about scientific theories and technology we can hardly imagine. That is the essence of good science fiction.I can recommend this series to anyone, the sf-lovers as well as anyone else. See how contact is made with an alien civilization on a planet lightyears away, and see our society reacting when the aliens are setting out to invade earth in 400 years.Given the quality of these episodes, I cannot wait for the other two books to be adapted to the screen. There are some crazy new ideas about dark forest theories and the end of stars and civilisations.	pleasant surprise really like adaptation watch weekend much well science fiction series visual captivate character convincingly portray deep emotion yes movie diverge book book write chinese point view series take place england different character affect story nice thing cixin liu book author exploration idea future possible encounter alien life level technology far exceed work show great admirer grandmaster sf isaac asimov give we completely new vision scientific theory technology hardly imagine essence good science fiction recommend series anyone sf lover well anyone else see contact make alien civilization planet lightyear away see society react alien set invade earth year give quality episode wait two book adapt screen crazy new idea dark forest theory end star civilisation
0	They obviously spent a lot of money on new sets but that did not add much to the show. The acting is worse. The writing is terrible. The plot is juvenile. The medical content is quite unbelievable.

0	"I wrote an Amazon review when I finally got around to watching GoT and ended up with crazed fans coming out of the woodwork to tell me how wrong I was to not like GoT. After watching more episodes because - as GoT fans insisted - I needed to see MORE to understand/like the show - I decided that the GoT is not for me - even if the beatings will continue 'till morale will improve.. Watching more didn't improve my opinion really - it only made me feel nauseated. I felt I was only stating the obvious in saying that there is a lot of pointless gratuitous sex and graphic violence on GoT. For some - that's what they like about the show. For me - it's a needless distraction to what could have been a compelling story.Here is my original review of GoT:As a lifelong geek, I've been hearing a lot about GoT for a while now and had high hopes of it filling the much-needed niche for satisfying story-telling that I came to know and love in such shows as Firefly and the Lord of the Rings trilogy - or at least something intelligent, interesting, creative and well thought out. Visually, Game of Thrones is gorgeous - at least in the initial snow speckled scenes, where you see a group of heavily bundled up guys in a very stark snow scape. Just one look at the costuming and the beautiful filming really sparks any geek to say, ""Hey- this might be really good."" Knowing that the guy who was Boromir in LoTR is playing a major role also gives hopes and expectations of something really great.The initial scenes where one of the riders stumbles upon a truly grisly scene of carnage is difficult to watch - but at least you get the sense that there is something going on, some kind of mystery - that needs to be solved and the question of just who the White Walkers are is intriguing. So despite the gore, I was initially very much taken in.And that's about where my interest stopped as the first episode devolved into pointless scenes of violence, sex, nudity, more sex - still more sex - to the point where it became a bit absurd and almost dull. So sad to ruin something that could have been epic with a lot of sex scenes that weren't even in the original books. The gore and grisly scenes of beheadings and splatter porn also painfully reminded me of the really horrible rendition of the Hobbit, where something that was written as a kid's story (talking about the Hobbit here) was made into a gory display of constant sword fights and beheadings. It kind of reduces all of human existence to one that is animalistic and somewhat mundane: animals are born, they hunt for and/or find food, they have sex, make other little animals, fight each other for territory (possibly) and die. Fine. But a fantasy that makes it seem like all of human existence boils down to this common denominator (and nothing more) is not only uninteresting and uninspired - it's dead depressing. It also seems such a waste of excellent casting, costuming, cinematographic excellence and a story that might capture my interest - if the makers of the series wasn't so insistent and determined to fill every scene with sex of every sort and violence. All the flying offal and swinging tits really distract from what might have been an interesting story.The first episode of GoT was the most graphic thing I've ever seen - including that time when some college housemates rented a porn movie and that other time when some other friends had a halloween horror movie marathon. At least the gore in those movies had a point and made sense in the progress of the story, whatever story that was and the sex scenes actually were important in the plot - or at least vaguely important for the plot. (It's saying something when the sex and gore in the average horror flick is more meaningful than the sex and gore in GoT.) All the sex and blood splattered scenes of GoT just seem to make the whole thing less believable. It's hard to really get lost in the story and really imagine being there - when every scene is a blood-soaked and sex-filled rampage to the point of being ridiculous. The sex seems less real - because there's so much of it. The gore seems less important - because there's too much of it. The actual story is completely overwhelmed by the heavy-handedness all the sex and violence.If a fellow geek friend were to ask me about Game of Thrones - I would comment that the opening credits were really nicely done - with a sort of steampunk, nanotechnology and clever clockwork building of the map, castles, houses and landscape with these interesting ladders connecting various areas of the map. The opening credits was awesome - far more inspired than the series itself. The music is well done. The casting is brilliant (and would have been amazing - or could have been, if such talent wasn't wasted and drowned out by all the other stuff.) Visually (when every scene isn't blood soaked and/or crammed from end to end with pointless sex and violence) - Game of Thrones is really beautiful - with its gorgeous period costuming and sets and great cinematography. The actual story - the one that I might have been more interested in learning more about, if it weren't for all the gore, guts and grunts - is something I'm sad that I won't get a chance to know without reading a plot synopsis somewhere else. But the actual series just comes off as a porn flick with lots and lots of violence that happens to be set in the middle ages."	write amazon review finally get around watch get end craze fan come woodwork tell wrong like get watch episode get fan insist need see understand like show decide get even beat continue till morale improve watch improve opinion really make feel nauseate feel state obvious say lot pointless gratuitous sex graphic violence get like show needle distraction could compel story original review get lifelong geek hear lot get high hop fill much need niche satisfy story tell come know love show firefly lord ring trilogy least something intelligent interest creative well think visually game throne gorgeous least initial snow speckle scene see group heavily bundle guy stark snow scape one look costume beautiful film really spark geek say hey might really good know guy boromir lotr play major role also give hop expectation something really great initial scene one rider stumble upon truly grisly scene carnage difficult watch least get sense something go kind mystery need solve question white walker intrigue despite gore initially much take interest stop first episode devolve pointless scene violence sex nudity sex still sex point become bite absurd almost dull sad ruin something could epic lot sex scene even original book gore grisly scene behead splatter porn also painfully remind really horrible rendition hobbit something write kid story talk hobbit make gory display constant sword fight behead kind reduce human existence one animalistic somewhat mundane animal bear hunt find food sex make little animal fight territory possibly die fine fantasy make seem like human existence boil common denominator nothing uninteresting uninspired dead depress also seem waste excellent cast costume cinematographic excellence story might capture interest maker series insistent determine fill every scene sex every sort violence fly offal swing tit really distract might interest story first episode get graphic thing ever see include time college housemate rent porn movie time friend halloween horror movie marathon least gore movie point make sense progress story whatever story sex scene actually important plot least vaguely important plot say something sex gore average horror flick meaningful sex gore get sex blood splatter scene get seem make whole thing less believable hard really get lose story really imagine every scene blood soak sex fill rampage point ridiculous sex seem less real much gore seem less important much actual story completely overwhelm heavy handedness sex violence fellow geek friend ask game throne would comment open credit really nicely do sort steampunk nanotechnology clever clockwork build map castle house landscape interest ladder connect various area map open credit awesome far inspire series music well do cast brilliant would amaze could talent waste drown stuff visually every scene blood soak cram end end pointless sex violence game throne really beautiful gorgeous period costume set great cinematography actual story one might interest learn gore gut grunt something sad get chance know without read plot synopsis somewhere else actual series come porn flick lot lot violence happen set middle age
1	"What had to be expected from Bethesda. As a long time fan of 1 and 2 I was already well aware Bethesda never understood Fallout. Fallout isn't about some 1950s retro future, that world got nuked and is gone! All that remains of that time are uncanny relics of the past. Bethesda Fallout looks and feels like the bombs fell 20 years ago and we're bearly making a comeback, not 200 years later.Also the ""Ghouls are Zombies"" thing is a hill Bethesda is apparently willing to die on.Costumes and settings look quite nice, the female lead is convincing. Turning the whole message to ""capitalism bad"" is laughable coming from Amazon. Also way too light hearted. Has vibes of Suicide Squad but without being funny. Also retcons a lot of Fallout 1,2 and New Vegas. Mediocre show at best."	expect bethesda long time fan already well aware bethesda never understand fallout fallout retro future world get nuke go remain time uncanny relic past bethesda fallout look feel like bomb fall year ago bearly make comeback year later also ghoul zombie thing hill bethesda apparently will die costume setting look quite nice female lead convince turn whole message capitalism bad laughable come amazon also way light hearted vibe suicide squad without funny also retcon lot fallout new vegas mediocre show well
0	The Rookie really is very enjoyable to watch. The acting, humour, moral stories with here and there some action and drama, it all fits nicely together.. well, until season 3 that is. From that moment on it turned into some woke PC travesty of a TV-show, that tries to push some political agenda down your throat. For me this became too painful to watch, such a shame. One star.	rookie really enjoyable watch act humour moral story action drama fit nicely together well season moment turn wake pc travesty tv show try push political agenda throat become painful watch shame one star
2	I loved how they castigated the true nature of sexual shift and how people out of nowhere declare that there sexual preferences have changed. Especially in Hollywood! It's a food for thought. It makes you wonder why people seem so confused about their identities these days. As shown in the series one always force such dark incidents in their hindbrain. This is the way one survives traumatic experiences. Such series leave me thinking that still there are people in the west who believe in natural course of things. That's the beauty of literature, you don't have to directly state what you want to state.	love castigate true nature sexual shift people nowhere declare sexual preference change especially hollywood food think make wonder people seem confuse identity day show series one always force dark incident hindbrain way one survive traumatic experience series leave think still people west believe natural course thing beauty literature directly state want state

2	"The Netflix series, Ripley, might be appreciated more by those unfamiliar with the 1999 Matt Damon film, The Talented Mr. Ripley. Both are adaptations of Patricia Highsmith's novel. Frankly, I like both versions. However, Some may enjoy this production more without knowing the story in advance.The characters' ages in this version are more in line with the book, and the performances are solid. Dakota Fanning's performance was ok, but I couldn't help but wonder if another actress might have brought more to the role.This new 8-episode series is a more faithful adaptation of the novel. It captures the psychological thriller essence of the novel, delving deeper into the moral ambiguity of Tom Ripley's psyche. In addition, the Italian locations chosen here create a feel closer to the novel than in the 1999 movie. So does ""the look"" of this production, thanks to the choice of Cinematographer Robert Elswit. He has created a gorgeous black-and-white masterpiece. Like any painting, photography is all about the lighting. It's no coincidence that this production exhibits the same strong artistic qualities as the Caravaggio paintings that Greenleaf and then Ripley become obsessed with.I really enjoyed all eight episodes, but I believe it would have been even better if the footage had been cut down to a seven-episode series. In other words, I think some tightening would have improved it. I suspect the creators were as impressed by the cinematography as I was, making it difficult to trim it down. I believe tighter editing would have increased the tension and suspense, which are already intense in several scenes. I also appreciated the dark humor injected occasionally. It's very Hitchcockian."	netflix series ripley might appreciate unfamiliar matt damon film talente mr ripley adaptation patricia highsmith novel frankly like version however may enjoy production without know story advance character age version line book performance solid dakota fan performance ok help wonder another actress might bring role new episode series faithful adaptation novel capture psychological thriller essence novel delve deep moral ambiguity tom ripley psyche addition italian location choose create feel close novel movie look production thank choice cinematographer robert elswit create gorgeous black white masterpiece like paint photography light coincidence production exhibit strong artistic quality caravaggio paint greenleaf ripley become obsess really enjoy eight episode believe would even well footage cut seven episode series word think tighten would improve suspect creator impress cinematography make difficult trim believe tight edit would increase tension suspense already intense several scene also appreciate dark humor inject occasionally hitchcockian
2	I really enjoy Gray's Anatomy so much that I binged watch the first seasons on Netflix. So all the way up to season 13 I really felt the emotional highs and lows from every episode. Or Almost all. I love all the complicated but pretty real situations that are portrayed. I expect this when I'm watching. I just started watching season 14 on Netflix and have to say episode 5, where Amelia has a brain tumor was like an after thought. I thought it would of been the main focus. Maybe since my sister has gone through 3 brain surgeries and having Amelia bouncing back so quickly, especially with the size of her tumor in the show was a disappointment. Episode 4 had your jaw drop when you found out but it lost its momentum. I think Shondra Rimes is excellent at capturing her audience attention. Episode 5 tho felt like a quickie.	really enjoy gray anatomy much binge watch first season netflix way season really feel emotional high low every episode almost love complicate pretty real situation portray expect watch start watch season netflix say episode amelia brain tumor like think think would main focus maybe since sister go brain surgery amelia bounce back quickly especially size tumor show disappointment episode jaw drop find lose momentum think shondra rim excellent capture audience attention episode tho feel like quickie

0	Even with such a high budget, the special effects are mediocre at best. Regarding Ye Wenjie's spiritual core and the complexity of the characters, the screenwriter and producers only scratch the surface. The entire series is filled with Western society's stereotypes and arrogant disrespect towards Eastern countries. I felt deeply offended and uncomfortable. It's regrettable that my first IMDb review is for The Three-Body Problem, the Netflix version. What's even more disappointing is that many of the highlights from the original work are either deleted or drastically altered in the TV series. The actors clearly haven't read the original work and lack a basic understanding of their characters.	even high budget special effect mediocre good regard ye wenjie spiritual core complexity character screenwrit producer scratch surface entire series fill western society stereotype arrogant disrespect towards eastern country felt deeply offend uncomfortable regrettable first imdb review three body problem netflix version even disappoint many highlight original work either delete drastically alter tv series actor clearly read original work lack basic understand character

It becomes tiresome, and it is biaised, so would be nice if the studios hear that voice one time, that it would have been a good opportunity to have a more unusuale and international vibe and to know more about the portugal / japan partnership gor example rather than involving these perpetual English characters.

2	(Disclaimer, fan of the book and original series) I feel like it has been slightly rushed, you don't really get a sense of time passing. Some of the story has been glossed over a bit and some of the side characters have become relegated to a cameo. They kinda just jump right into it. It's not necessarily a bad thing but I feel it's paced a bit quick and could be confusing to people new to the series. Perhaps a narrator would've helped? Some of the dialogue has been dumbed down a little and shortened. The prison scene should've also done a better job showing him being taught a little of the language and politics. Still, overall I'm hooked and can't wait to watch the rest :)	disclaimer fan book original series feel like slightly rush really get sense time pass story glos bite side character become relegate cameo kinda jump right necessarily bad thing feel pace bite quick could confuse people new series perhaps narrator would help dialogue dumbe little shorten prison scene also do well job show teach little language politic still overall hook wait watch rest
1	"While there is certainly a lot to praise in this rendition of the Fallout universe, I still can't really call myself a fan of this show.Beginning with the praise, this show was beautiful to look at. The cinematography was strong, the costumes were great, the production design was absolutely fantastic, and the visual effects were well done. Basically every technical aspect of the show was very well done and often times exceptionally so.The makeup for the ghouls was excellent, the designs for the creatures and world were stylish and interesting, and the action sequences were well choreographed and well executed.Beyond the technicals, the show's cartoonish tone and sense of humor was sometimes very effective. There were a few times that it made me chuckle, no doubt. And I was genuinely impressed with the setup of the story. The initial scene that established the Nuclear Fallout was excellent, and Lucy's introduction was very well done. You get a real sense of who she is almost immediately and are drawn into her perspective effortlessly.Part of that is the lead actress' talent. In fact, nearly every member of the cast performed their roles quite well (with a few notable exceptions).And overall, despite my criticisms (which I'll get into), there were definitely moments in the story that were entertaining and engaging. I was curious about the mysteries the show introduced and was interested enough to follow it to the conclusion.But that's all the praise I have to offer. Now, I'm afraid, is the time to discuss my criticisms.For one thing, the story's cartoonish tone and sardonic attitude made it hard for me to really get invested in the dramatic aspects of the story. And the show definitely wanted me to be invested and really care for the big dramatic revelations during the finale, but I just wasn't buying into it. The final episode was full of big twists that I saw coming a mile away (partly because they were very unsubtle in setting them up) but also because it's actually such a cliche trope at this point. The father character, who the protagonist idealized, is actually a bad man... SO SHOCKING!I found the introduction for Lucy's story to be interesting but as it went on it just repetitive and less and less engaging as it went on. Her disillusionment felt forced. It was driven by a series of reveals where things she admired or cared about were systematically deconstructed and shown to be evil all along, just like her dad. And over and over that just kept happening, and it just became trite and predictable before long. I didn't feel any emotion for her story in the final episode.The Ghoul (who's also the cowboy actor, I'm forgetting his name) also had the same arc and his character was a symbol of the deconstructionist mentality of the entire script. His false cowboy identity is the perfect metaphor for what this story is saying overall. The ""cowboy"" is a myth that's just a nice looking mask for bad men who were violent and what not. That heroic ideal isn't real, it's just a mask. Just like the Ghoul's wife isn't really a good woman, she's a cartoonishly evil corporate monster who pretends to be good. The one thing I actually like though about the cowboy angle is how it's a reversal of Lucy's role in the story. The cowboy tames the wilderness, Lucy is made wild by the wilderness. That was pretty cool.Easily the worst character in the story was Maximus. His contribution was so bland and poorly executed, I wondered why they even included it. He was a character I really felt nothing for. They didn't stress what his attachment or investment in anything was. I never felt his motivations properly. I observed that he was unhappy with being bullied, I guess. But his murderous lying attitude made him fundamentally unlikable and stopped my from pittying him like I think the script wanted me to. His plotlines are overly driven by convenience and contrivance, and he's ultimately given a redemption arc that feels entirely unearned. He also has a very thin and emotionless romance with the lead that I felt absolutely nothing for. His friendship with the nonbinary brother was emotionless as well. I just felt like every scene with him was a waste of screen time.Oh and did I mention that not all the humor is funny? And that when it isn't funny, it's actually fairly annoying? A mismatch between silly Ned Flanders like performance and brutal violence or dialogue is only funny so many times before it gets old...And I don't know, in general this show is so cynical and mean sprited. It takes every opportunity to claim that wholesomeness or reciprocity is little more than a mask for selfishness. It makes sure to try and ""disillusion"" the viewers of the idea of ""good guys"" as nothing more than naivete but then it has cartoonishly evil ""bad guys"" who are greedy illuminati types that have nothing but selfish/bad intentions for their actions. If believing in fundamentally good guys is naive, then isn't believing in fundamentally bad guys? Because ultimately that's the same thing. It just shifts a good guy into meaning ""not as bad as the really bad guys"".The whole show mocks and insults the naivete of the vault dwellers and seems to suggest that their reciprocal ideal is old fashioned and just a cynical lie, but I don't buy that. I also don't think the story earns that as a conclusion, I think it contrives that conclusion. Lucy's story reminds me of the classic ""small town girl moves to the big city"" story. She's from this small, sheltered community and heads out to the ""real world"" and is forced to adapt and become less ""small town"" in order to make it. I think that's where this whole show's philosophy comes from. It's city dwellers who have internalized the ""only look out for yourself"" ethic as universal and then cynically insist that everyone secretly feels the same way deep down. And projecting that mentality onto an Apocalypse suggests that it's human nature to feel this way.But again, that feels like a contrivance. I'm certainly convinced that there's genuine value in those ethics that the show failed to confront, and that failure made it hard for me to get invested in Lucy's character turn because I didn't feel ""disillusioned"" along with her. I just felt like ""well they just decided to make everyone with that point of view a liar, that feels totally contrived. It doesn't prove or convince me of anything"".Perhaps you're an extremely cynical person. Or perhaps you're just not keen to interpret themes so intently. If you read it at merely a surface level, I could see enjoying it just for the jokes and the spectacle.Before the end of the review I must also point out the irony of the ""anti capitalist"" messaging in the show. Coming from Amazon of all places, that's totally rich.But yeah, not the worst show ever. Not by a long shot. In fact, it has many redeeming aspects. And depending on how deeply you intend to read into the story or your worldview this could be more or less enjoyable. I personally found the messaging to be a roadblock but I can see that hasn't been an issue for many others. But I am having a hard time understanding why other people seem to think it's well written as a narrative. I just don't find it to be engaging or emotionally effective. Lucy is the only character I care about and the rest feel like 1-2 dimensional cartoons and little more. The drama lacked drama, so to speak. But that's just how I felt.It's worth checking out regardless. If you're not sold by episode 3, then turn it off."	certainly lot praise rendition fallout universe still really call fan show begin praise show beautiful look cinematography strong costume great production design absolutely fantastic visual effect well do basically every technical aspect show well do often time exceptionally makeup ghouls excellent design creature world stylish interest action sequence well choreograph well execute beyond technical show cartoonish tone sense humor sometimes effective time make chuckle doubt genuinely impress setup story initial scene establish nuclear fallout excellent lucy introduction well do get real sense almost immediately draw perspective effortlessly part lead actress talent fact nearly every member cast perform role quite well notable exception overall despite criticism get definitely moment story entertain engage curious mystery show introduce interest enough follow conclusion praise offer afraid time discuss criticism one thing story cartoonish tone sardonic attitude make hard really get invest dramatic aspect story show definitely want invest really care big dramatic revelation finale buy final episode full big twist see come mile away partly unsubtle set also actually cliche trope point father character protagonist idealize actually bad man shock find introduction lucy story interest go repetitive less less engage go disillusionment feel force drive series reveal thing admire care systematically deconstruct show evil along like dad keep happen become trite predictable long feel emotion story final episode ghoul also cowboy actor forget name also arc character symbol deconstructionist mentality entire script false cowboy identity perfect metaphor story say overall cowboy myth nice look mask bad man violent heroic ideal real mask like ghoul wife really good woman cartoonishly evil corporate monster pretend good one thing actually like though cowboy angle reversal lucy role story cowboy tame wilderness lucy make wild wilderness pretty cool easily bad character story maximus contribution bland poorly execute wonder even include character really feel nothing stress attachment investment anything never feel motivation properly observe unhappy bully guess murderous lie attitude make fundamentally unlikable stop pittye like think script want plotline overly drive convenience contrivance ultimately give redemption arc feel entirely unearned also thin emotionless romance lead feel absolutely nothing friendship nonbinary brother emotionless well feel like every scene waste screen time oh mention humor funny funny actually fairly annoy mismatch silly ned flander like performance brutal violence dialogue funny many time get old know general show cynical mean sprite take every opportunity claim wholesomeness reciprocity little mask selfishness make sure try disillusion viewer idea good guy nothing naivete cartoonishly evil bad guy greedy illuminati type nothing selfish bad intention action believe fundamentally good guy naive believe fundamentally bad guy ultimately thing shift good guy mean bad really bad guy whole show mock insult naivete vault dweller seem suggest reciprocal ideal old fashion cynical lie buy also think story earn conclusion think contrive conclusion lucy story remind classic small town girl move big city story small shelter community head real world force adapt become less small town order make think whole show philosophy come city dweller internalize look ethic universal cynically insist everyone secretly feel way deep project mentality onto apocalypse suggest human nature feel way feel like contrivance certainly convince genuine value ethic show fail confront failure make hard get invest lucy character turn feel disillusion along feel like well decide make everyone point view liar feel totally contrive prove convince anything perhaps extremely cynical person perhaps keen interpret theme intently read merely surface level could see enjoy joke spectacle end review must also point irony anti capitalist message show come amazon place totally rich yeah bad show ever long shoot fact many redeem aspect depend deeply intend read story worldview could less enjoyable personally find message roadblock see issue many other hard time understand people seem think well write narrative find engage emotionally effective lucy character care rest feel like dimensional cartoon little drama lack drama speak feel worth check regardless sell episode turn
0	How is this show entertaining? All I see on this show is doctors making out and not doing what doctors do.This show is probably the most overrated show on television. Like I just said, all it shows is doctors and nurses making out during shifts. Hell, usually when they do have a patient, it dies because they are too busy having sex in the operation room.Now we have to suffer Private Practice? This show is unrealistic and is stupid. Try watching ER instead. Now that's a good show other then this piece of $hit.2/10	show entertain see show doctor make doctor show probably overrate show television like say show doctor nurse make shift hell usually patient die busy sex operation room suffer private practice show unrealistic stupid try watch er instead good show piece hit
2	Good music (it's nice that they got some of the songs from the fallout games), good atmosphere, nice setting with an new story set in the fallout universe but that Maximus character has got to be the dumbest guy ever portrayed and I've seen Home Alone. Maybe they tried to make it funny but it isn't. It's cringe. The main character is a dits but it's normal because she grew up in a vault with everyone following that 1950s atomic attitude. All smiles and all rigid but that's how it should be. Also too bad we don't enough scavenging and looting of weapons and armour as in the games but that's ok.	good music nice get song fallout game good atmosphere nice set new story set fallout universe maximus character get dumb guy ever portray see home alone maybe try make funny cringe main character dit normal grow vault everyone follow atomic attitude smile rigid also bad enough scavenge loot weapon armour game ok

2	I wanted to give the series 10 stars, but Johnny Flynn's portrayal of Richard Greenleaf just didn't have the charisma that was needed.Jude Law's Greenleaf was good-looking, unpredictable, fun, etc. A person with magnetism. Whereas, this one seem tired and settled. The only rise out of him was about how many ice cube trays the refrigerator should have.Dakota Fanning does a great job, and shows that there was no need for the film to have two female characters. Eliot Sumner isn't who I had in mind for the character of Freddie Miles. When he first appeared, I thought it was a boyish-looking woman. Sumner did the job well, but even though the actor is in his 30s, he looked like a teenager.Having said all that. The cinematography was beautiful and it was great to see how Ripley not just evolved, but also his reactions after murdering someone. The getting rid of the bodies, and other evidence, the cleaning up afterwards, creating alibis, trying to outwit everyone day after day. It's not just physically tiring but mentally as well.	want give series star johnny flynn portrayal richard greenleaf charisma need jude law greenleaf good look unpredictable fun etc person magnetism whereas one seem tire settle rise many ice cube tray refrigerator dakota fan great job show need film two female character eliot sumner mind character freddie mile first appear think boyish look woman sumner job well even though actor look like teenager say cinematography beautiful great see ripley evolve also reaction murder someone get rid body evidence clean afterwards create alibi try outwit everyone day day physically tire mentally well
0	This is a great series Sanada and Sawai are absolutely stunning. But this series should not be called Shogun. It is so far removed form the source material that I am at a loss as to understand why the Clavell estate didn't put their legal foot down and stop production. The story vaguely follows the timeliness of the book but places so much emphasis on the development of the characters of Toranaga and Mariko that it does a severe disservice to the essential element of the book. Which is Blackthorne's slow and inexorable assimilation into the Japanese culture. It also glosses over the basic antagonistic relationship between the Catholic and Protestant Characters in the novel. A really rousing series but it is so different from the novel as to be almost unrecognizable.	great series sanada sawai absolutely stun series call shogun far remove form source material loss understand clavell estate put legal foot stop production story vaguely follow timeliness book place much emphasis development character toranaga mariko severe disservice essential element book blackthorne slow inexorable assimilation japanese culture also glos basic antagonistic relationship catholic protestant character novel really rouse series different novel almost unrecognizable
2	"As a fan of Nathan Fillion through his ""Firefly"" and ""Castle"" series, I happily anticipated this new series. Having watched the pilot, I am not disappointed. Once again, his affable personality is a highlight. Fortunately, this series has much more going for it, especially a stellar cast.The basic story is about a 40-year-old police rookie, John Nolan, who is trying to find himself after major life changes. As it turns out, this rookie has an uncanny ability to engage suspects on a personal level. But that might not be enough to keep him on the force. His watch sergeant plans to harass him until he quits.There are actually three rookies and the series follows all of them and their training officers. The pilot takes them through their first days of on-the-job training. The show demonstrates many of the technical issues officers have to master and the personal issues that can result from this demanding occupation.The pilot has plenty of action and a good mix of interesting challenges for the rookie officer Nolan.Update 1-18-21: This review applies to the first two seasons only because I did not watch the third."	fan nathan fillion firefly castle series happily anticipate new series watch pilot disappoint affable personality highlight fortunately series much go especially stellar cast basic story year old police rookie john nolan try find major life change turn rookie uncanny ability engage suspect personal level might enough keep force watch sergeant plan harass quit actually three rookie series follow train officer pilot take first day job train show demonstrate many technical issue officer master personal issue result demand occupation pilot plenty action good mix interest challenge rookie officer nolan update review apply first two season watch third
0	I felt like I was watching a rerun of the final season of Game of Thrones. Did the series have something to do with the books? Yes, sort of, but everything was extremely rushed, particularly the most important and wonderful parts of the books, the mind-blowing ideas. Instead, Benioff and Weiss added a whole bunch of extraneous characters and storylines, which have nothing to do with the book and which didn't add to the story in any way, but only proved how politically correct they could be. The environmental message was completely lost. The author's fascinating views and ideas of how a human society would be transformed by the knowledge that they were going to be attacked by aliens with vastly superior technology- also lost in favor of producing Disney-like storylines instead. I hated how much everything was dumbed down. All of the Chinese locations were changed to Oxford, England of all places and names were Anglicized. Clearly Americans are too dumb to remember Chinese names. The wonderful physics puzzles which gradually unfold in the books were glossed over with lightning speed in favor of hot chicks with swords. The video game was totally ruined imo. Again, clearly Benioff and Weiss think that Americans are too dumb to understand physics, even when explained by someone as amazing as Cixin Liu. And I'm no physics genius. I was always terrible at physics in school, but the author explains it so well that even I can understand it. Overall, this felt like yet another ho-humm marvel movie. If you really want to know what the book was about, read it. If reading is not your thing, then watch the Chinese series, which is currently airing on prime. It has its flaws: it's too drawn out and has the most god-awful soundtrack, but it's very faithful to the source material and overall an excellent film adaptation with a very genuine feel to it. If you want to see a movie series, in which the source material was completely transformed to make the story more exciting and interesting while preserving the author's original ideas, watch Foundation. I won't be watching any more garbage by Benioff and Weiss.	feel like watch rerun final season game throne series something book yes sort everything extremely rush particularly important wonderful part book mind blow idea instead benioff weiss add whole bunch extraneous character storyline nothing book add story way prove politically correct could environmental message completely lose author fascinate view idea human society would transform knowledge go attack alien vastly superior technology also lose favor produce disney like storyline instead hat much everything dumbe chinese location change oxford england place name anglicize clearly americans dumb remember chinese name wonderful physics puzzle gradually unfold book gloss lightning speed favor hot chick sword video game totally ruin imo clearly benioff weiss think americans dumb understand physics even explain someone amaze cixin liu physics genius always terrible physics school author explain well even understand overall feel like yet another ho humm marvel movie really want know book read read thing watch chinese series currently air prime flaw draw god awful soundtrack faithful source material overall excellent film adaptation genuine feel want see movie series source material completely transform make story excite interest preserve author original idea watch foundation watch garbage benioff weiss

First 2 seasons were very enjoyable, but the last one went full BLM. Most people don't watch TV shows for political commentery, they watch it to be entertained (I'm one of them). Still, will keep an eye on this show. But unless they get politics out of here, I'm done with it.	love show different enough cop drama make interest nathan amaze everywhere play first season enjoyable last one go full blm people watch tv show political commentery watch entertain one still keep eye show unless get politic do
0	"It feels like they've stretched a good film into a mini-series unnecessarily. The black and white cinematography feels like a gimmick, and the inclusion of irrelevant clips adds to the confusion. While it does offer some insight into Ripley's backstory, the performances come across as lackluster and fail to breathe life into the characters. Overall, it's a lackluster experience that struggles to hold the audience's attention or leave a lasting impact. The series downfall lies in the director's excessive creative freedom, which detracts from the original's brilliance. By attempting to inject artistic flair, they've instead diluted the essence of what made the original so captivating. Particularly disappointing is the mishandling of Freddy's character, stripping away the complexity that defined him. The casting choices for the ""show"" feel off, especially considering the nostalgic journey they aimed to take viewers on. Additionally, the CGI depicting the boat burning is egregiously poor, serving as a glaring reminder of the film's shortcomings. Overall, it's a letdown for fans who expected more from a beloved classic."	feel like stretch good film mini series unnecessarily black white cinematography feel like gimmick inclusion irrelevant clip add confusion offer insight ripley backstory performance come across lackluster fail breathe life character overall lackluster experience struggle hold audience attention leave last impact series downfall lie director excessive creative freedom detract original brilliance attempt inject artistic flair instead dilute essence make original captivate particularly disappoint mishandle freddy character strip away complexity define cast choice show feel especially consider nostalgic journey aim take viewer additionally cgi depict boat burn egregiously poor serve glare reminder film shortcoming overall letdown fan expect beloved classic

0	"First of all let me start by saying I just rewatched Twin Peaks. To watch another TV show after that is sort of like eating a big ice cream sundae right before dinner.But, it really helps to put it into perspective how bad this production is. Let's start from the first scenes of pre fallout world. There is no time to feel suspense at all about impending doom. We have no feelings for any of the characters. We have five minutes of slow mo at a children's birthday party. It's like the writers of the show are just saying ""how can we get there fastest?"" and things are tossed into the script to serve a purpose for the writers. A good writer could make an entire season about pre fallout world.Why am I mentioning this? Because the entire show is like this. This is the dialogue between writers: "" people need to die. "" "" who?"" "" I don't know, write them into the script so that they CAN die. It serves a function to get us to X""""bombs need to fall"" ""how?"" ""who cares, just make bombs happen. We need them to get to X""We don't care about the deaths. And the violence is endless. Just be prepared to watch people you don't care about and know nothing about die constantly.The show skips from one scene to the next like a baboon with ADD. And that is the major difference between a good show like Twin Peaks and a waste of time like Fallout. We aren't forced to deal with ANY unwanted or uneasy emotions for any significant period of time in Fallout. Just think about that for a minute because part of that is the exact reason why people watch TV. It's called catharsis! The concept has been around for millennia.Its not the first or best show to do anything it attempts. The humor falls flat. The ghoul is cliché. The dialogue is not memorable.. It's a blood bath.

1	"Why lazy writing? Because I'm only halfway through episode 2, and half the characters (the so-called ""Oxford Five"") seem to have to decorate every sentence with the f-word. I'm no prude, but this to me is just lazy writing. Yes, you could argue it's an attempt to bring some ""reality"" to the work, but this is meant to be an epic tale of hard science and cosmic survival.The British scenes, with the Oxford Five (who are all portrayed by very self-consciously ""actorly"" types), are incredibly irritating. This typical BBC Doctor Who cheap TV dialogue, acting and directing style clashes with the more cinematic Chinese scenes set during the Cultural Revolution (which they do manage to get right).And though the source material helps carry the show (please read the books if you haven't), there's very little tension or sense of wonder generated. The Chinese show, despite being slow (or perhaps because of it) managed this much better.I'll keep watching, since I was excited when I heard about this remake, but unfortunately right from the first few minutes I knew it would be a disappointment."	lazy write halfway episode half character call oxford five seem decorate every sentence f word prude lazy write yes could argue attempt bring reality work mean epic tale hard science cosmic survival british scene oxford five portray self consciously actorly type incredibly irritate typical bbc doctor cheap tv dialogue act direct style clash cinematic chinese scene set cultural revolution manage get right though source material help carry show please read book little tension sense wonder generate chinese show despite slow perhaps manage much well keep watch since excite hear remake unfortunately right first minute know would disappointment

The world that they have visually created is very extraordinary and that's why it's worth watching the show. I don't remember the original series. However, after initial enthusiasm, I found the story more like a telenovela. There's not much of Japanese martial arts to be seen, more tiresome political dialogues. For me, most of the actors are convincing and charismatic. Unfortunately, the main actor doesn't convince me in the role. He is strangely wooden and stiff. In this respect, I have very conflicting feelings. But I'll keep watching it in the hope that the storytelling will convince me at some point.	happy give star set light costume hair sound nature excite start keep go world visually create extraordinary worth watch show remember original series however initial enthusiasm find story like telenovela much japanese martial art see tiresome political dialogue actor convince charismatic unfortunately main actor convince role strangely wooden stiff respect conflict feel keep watch hope storytelle convince point

2	"In the array of shows on Netflix, ""Baby Reindeer"" stands out as a miniseries that's hard to pin down. It goes beyond being a stalker-based series; it delves into the intricacies of trauma, isolation, and the impact of abuse on a person's mind.Throughout its duration, ""Baby Reindeer"" presents unsettling moments and discomfort, which surprisingly turns out to be the show's strengths. The show boldly ventures into the realm of psychological drama, tearing apart the facade of comfort TV to expose the side of human suffering. This miniseries is an experience that pushes viewers to confront their limits when it comes to their own thresholds for discomfort and empathy.Right from the start, ""Baby Reindeer"" throws viewers into Donny's world portrayed by the real-life Donny---Richard Gadd.The first episode introduces Donny in all his complexity laying the groundwork for what seems like a story of decisions and questionable actions at first glance. However as the series progresses layers of Donny's character are gradually unveiled, revealing a grappling with a profound deep-seated trauma. The show doesn't shy away, from immersing its audience in an exploration of its character. The narrative structure, which is both immediate and relentless, refuses to coddle its viewers, instead opting for a raw portrayal of its characters. This approach creates an impact; it's alienating yet strangely captivating, immersing viewers in a world where characters feel both authentic and flawed. The brilliance of the show shines through its exploration of trauma and its lasting effects.As the series unfolds, the protagonist, initially portrayed as someone testing our patience with their choices, gradually reveals layers of his complexity. What once irked viewers now sparks curiosity as each episode delves deeper into the characters' psyche unveiling past traumas that shape their actions. By the 4th episode, Donny's hidden pain resurfaces, shedding light on his puzzling decisions. The show sensitively navigates the aftermath of abuse, depicting the burden of guilt and shame that the survivors experienced. Donny's vulnerability becomes palpable forcing audiences to confront how abuse can distort one's self-identity. What starts as subtle tension erupts into an exploration of the protagonist's struggles. The way trauma is shown in the story is subtle and integrated naturally becoming a part of the character's journey.Richard Gadd's performance as Donny is truly remarkable. He skillfully combines heartbreak and humor bringing a depth to the character that stays with you even after the movie ends. It's quite remarkable to see someone relive their trauma like Richard Gadd did; it was his experience and his bravery, in sharing and retelling it is admirable. Gadd's nuanced acting ensures that there's a touch of humanity shining through in Donny's questionable moments. His ability to bring lightness into situations speaks volumes about resilience even when faced with immense pain. On the other hand, Jessica Gunning steals the spotlight with her portrayal of Martha. Playing a stalker and compulsive liar, Martha evokes a mix of emotions from the audience. Gunning delivers a performance that triggers both sympathy and frustration towards Martha. Her character's unsettling presence serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities of mental illness and obsession. Martha's character is designed to get under your skin and Gunning pulls this off with such precision.The last two episodes of the show are truly outstanding, as the narrative threads that have been carefully laid out come together in a poignant and cathartic climax. The audience's understanding of Donny's choices and the slow reveal of his deep-seated trauma culminate in a realization of the gravity of his situation. His hesitation to report Martha, a choice that may have seemed unjustifiable before, is put to light leaving viewers with a sense of understanding of his predicament. The final two episodes provide a glimpse into each character's motivations and the enduring impacts of Donny's trauma. When Donny's vulnerabilities are exposed, it creates a gut-wrenching moment that compels viewers to face the extent of his suffering.At its heart, ""Baby Reindeer"" contemplates the repercussions of loneliness and abuse and through Donny's journey, the show delves into the isolation that often accompanies trauma. It goes beyond stalking; it delves into the wounds that persist long after physical injuries have healed. Watching ""Baby Reindeer"" is an experience, to say the least.It's a show that might make you cringe, feel uncomfortable, and even experience secondhand embarrassment, however, beneath its exterior, it delves into the emotional and harrowing exploration of human thoughts and emotions. This miniseries moves beyond the stalker storyline to focus on the effects of abuse and the isolating impact of solitude. The show's strength lies in how it handles topics with care and doesn't shy away from portraying the darker sides of its themes. What sets the show apart is the unflinching commitment to exposing social realities. The show holds up a mirror to society's often simplistic understanding of trauma and its aftermath. It challenges the notion that strength is an antidote to pain, instead presenting a more nuanced view of the human condition-one filled with layers of guilt, shame, and vulnerability.In summary, ""Baby Reindeer"" is an addition to Netflix's collection of thought-provoking dramas. It demands attention not for its daring storytelling but for the conversations it ignites about the invisible struggles many people endure. It leaves an indelible mark on viewers, serving as a powerful reminder of the complexities of trauma and the resilience required to confront it. This series goes beyond entertaining; it teaches, empathizes, and raises the bar for storytelling. Its portrayal of trauma, isolation, and the impact of abuse is honest and intense. Richard Gadd and Jessica Gunning deliver performances that bring their characters to life. If you're willing to confront the uncomfortable and delve into the depths of human emotion, ""Baby Reindeer"" is a journey worth taking."	array show netflix baby reindeer stand miniserie hard pin go beyond stalker base series delve intricacy trauma isolation impact abuse person mind throughout duration baby reindeer present unsettle moment discomfort surprisingly turn show strength show boldly venture realm psychological drama tear apart facade comfort tv expose side human suffer miniserie experience push viewer confront limit come threshold discomfort empathy right start baby reindeer throw viewer donny world portray real life donny richard gadd first episode introduce donny complexity lay groundwork seem like story decision questionable action first glance however series progress layer donny character gradually unveil reveal grapple profound deep seat trauma show shy away immerse audience exploration character narrative structure immediate relentless refuse coddle viewer instead opt raw portrayal character approach create impact alienate yet strangely captivate immerse viewer world character feel authentic flaw brilliance show shin exploration trauma last effect series unfold protagonist initially portray someone test patience choice gradually reveal layer complexity irk viewers spark curiosity episode delve deep character psyche unveil past traumas shape action th episode donny hide pain resurface shed light puzzle decision show sensitively navigate aftermath abuse depict burden guilt shame survivor experience donny vulnerability become palpable force audience confront abuse distort one self identity start subtle tension erupt exploration protagonist struggle way trauma show story subtle integrate naturally become part character journey richard gadd performance donny truly remarkable skillfully combine heartbreak humor bring depth character stay even movie end quite remarkable see someone relive trauma like richard gadd experience bravery share retell admirable gadd nuance act ensure touch humanity shin donny questionable moment ability bring lightness situation speak volume resilience even face immense pain hand jessica gun steal spotlight portrayal martha play stalker compulsive liar martha evoke mix emotion audience gun deliver performance trigger sympathy frustration towards martha character unsettle presence serve poignant reminder complexity mental illness obsession martha character design get skin gun pull precision last two episode show truly outstanding narrative thread carefully lie come together poignant cathartic climax audience understand donny choice slow reveal deep seat trauma culminate realization gravity situation hesitation report martha choice may seem unjustifiable put light leave viewer sense understand predicament final two episode provide glimpse character motivation endure impact donny trauma donny vulnerability expose create gut wrench moment compel viewer face extent suffer heart baby reindeer contemplate repercussion loneliness abuse donny journey show delve isolation often accompany trauma go beyond stalk delve wound persist long physical injury heal watch baby reindeer experience say least show might make cringe feel uncomfortable even experience secondhand embarrassment however beneath exterior delve emotional harrow exploration human thought emotion miniserie move beyond stalker storyline focus effect abuse isolate impact solitude show strength lie handle topic care shy away portray dark side theme set show apart unflinche commitment expose social reality show hold mirror society often simplistic understand trauma aftermath challenge notion strength antidote pain instead present nuance view human condition one fill layer guilt shame vulnerability summary baby reindeer addition netflix collection think provoke dramas demand attention dare storytelle conversation ignite invisible struggle many people endure leave indelible mark viewer serve powerful reminder complexity trauma resilience require confront series go beyond entertain teach empathize raise bar storytelle portrayal trauma isolation impact abuse honest intense richard gadd jessica gun deliver performance bring character life will confront uncomfortable delve depth human emotion baby reindeer journey worth take

She is main actress in show and she is so damn annoying, ridiculous, spoiled, childish, annoying, annoying, ANNOYING! There is not a single thing that is good about her. She's always complaining and she thinks she is the only person that matters and that she is the only one with problems. She loves to rant about her problems more then anything else. She is braking up with Derek for the most impossible stupid ridiculous reasons. And then she's telling him he must not date other women, because some day after decade maybe she will be ready to have something more with him. WHAT THE HELL!?Also, if I would decide to watch all seasons I'm pretty sure I would see everyone in the hospital sleeping with each other at some point. In season 8 there are probably patients screwing each other.	manage watch almost season far really know watch stand meredith main actress show damn annoy ridiculous spoil childish annoy annoy annoy single thing good always complain think person matter one problem love rant problem anything else brake derek impossible stupid ridiculous reason tell must date woman day decade maybe ready something hell also would decide watch season pretty sure would see everyone hospital sleep point season probably patient screw
2	It has been proven in the past that the high potential of Japanese culture has made its way to the cinema and television of the worlds, and this series has reminded us of this just one more time what this culture has to offer.I've been waiting to see this series since I saw the trailer, which I think was worth the wait.

0	Will all the wonderful equipment available which could have enhanced the story, the cinematography is wasted or even lack there off.Why on earth shot in black and white? The forceful performances fail to captivate and engage.There's no allure not enraging visuals, why make a series like this? Is best to listen to an audiobook.I suppose some will say it's gutsy and avant-garde to film this way. Sorry thanks but no thanks. With all the choices available this series fails miserably and would imagine fans of the book and movie, will no doubt be utterly disappointed. Put your attention elsewhere, this series is a lemon.	wonderful equipment available could enhance story cinematography waste even lack earth shoot black white forceful performance fail captivate engage allure enrage visual make series like good listen audiobook suppose say gutsy avant garde film way sorry thank thank choice available series fail miserably would imagine fan book movie doubt utterly disappoint put attention elsewhere series lemon

0	The CGI is decent, same for the fight scenes. However, the plot is quite weak, the pacing was very slow, after a while I had to start skipping some scenes.I was really excited when this show was announced given the success of Halo series, I was expecting something similar. This really fell short.I want to believe all the positive reviews are from people who have played the games and are already aware of the backstory. For people like me who haven't played the game yet, the show doesn't do anything to explain the characters or to make you care about anything.Just a dull drawn out movie, with lousy characters. Except the ghoul guy, he really tried to bring life to the movie.	cgi decent fight scene however plot quite weak pace slow start skip scene really excite show announce give success halo series expect something similar really fall short want believe positive review people play game already aware backstory people like play game yet show anything explain character make care anything dull draw movie lousy character except ghoul guy really try bring life movie
0	No one in this show seems like an actual person. Every single character is a bad parody with unbelievable, and not uncommonly nonsensical, dialogue.The casting is hit or miss. I like some of the actors for their roles but others seem out of place.Production value is quite good. Even the more mundane scenes are well shot. The way scenes are framed, the lighting, the cgi all look great. Whoever handled the filming deserves major props.The plot seems poorly portrayed. I haven't read the book but can't imagine that the show gets anywhere close. There's a series of clumsy pop culture references. The weight of scenes and decisions isn't properly conveyed. The progression isn't clean or comprehensive. The dynamics aren't well established.Overall, the show is not good. The source material seemed extremely interesting to me and the production value is great. The writing and characters are unfortunately...objectionable. I would have stopped after the first episode if I wasn't so invested. It didn't get easier to watch as the season went on and I won't watch any future seasons and this saddens me. =(	one show seem like actual person every single character bad parody unbelievable uncommonly nonsensical dialogue cast hit miss like actor role other seem place production value quite good even mundane scene well shoot way scene frame light cgi look great whoever handle film deserve major prop plot seem poorly portray read book imagine show get anywhere close series clumsy pop culture reference weight scene decision properly convey progression clean comprehensive dynamic well establish overall show good source material seem extremely interest production value great write character unfortunately objectionable would stop first episode invest get easy watch season go watch future season sadden
2	I read the books and watched one episode of the 'Three-Body Problem'. The Netflix series is quite good. Is it political? Yes, the book/show criticizes the Cultural Revolution (CR). Did the CR deserve the criticism? Yes, all the criticism it gets and more. Is the book/show anti-Chinese? No.Is Cixin Liu the greatest science fiction writer of our time? Yes, he is. By far. The books are good and the Netflix series is good. Am I a fan of Netflix? Not really. Netflix has done some really awful work. However, this series is rather good.The CR was a Chinese tragedy. It is rather sad that China's tragedy is gone from China, but all too apparent in the US.	read book watch one episode three body problem netflix series quite good political yes book show criticize cultural revolution cr cr deserve criticism yes criticism get book show anti chinese cixin liu great science fiction writer time yes far book good netflix series good fan netflix really netflix do really awful work however series rather good cr chinese tragedy rather sad china tragedy go china apparent we

0	In their rush to pursue other projects and their arrogance and selfishness in not handing the series over to other show runners and better writers, they ruined it.We can forgive the fact that there were so many continuity errors and stupid mistakes like coffee cups and water bottles left in scenes. I understand that things were chaotic and crew members can be forgiven.What is unforgivable is the unnecessarily furious pace, abandonment of plot points and lack of progress in key characters' arcs.Having Dany turn into the mad queen was pointless, there was no hero's redemption for Jamie, Jon Snow's revelation that he's both a Targaryen and a Stark...and then Bran the Useless becoming King?So much wasted potential.I wish these guys would never get another job in Hollywood again.	rush pursue project arrogance selfishness hand series show runner well writer ruin forgive fact many continuity error stupid mistake like coffee cup water bottle leave scene understand thing chaotic crew member forgive unforgivable unnecessarily furious pace abandonment plot point lack progress key character arc dany turn mad queen pointless hero redemption jamie jon snow revelation targaryen stark bran useless become king much waste potential wish guy would never get another job hollywood

2	Reading the plot was enough to pull me into it but what really kept me going was Martha. Jessica Gunning nailed every bit of raw emotion and craziness of character beautifully with her eyes and expressions so as so whenever she was on screen I was awstruck. Seeing it was enough creepy but knowing that it really happened to someone leaves u thrilled. Richard Gadd also played his leading part well along with the supporting cast but I just can't appreciate Gunning enough through words. Storytelling was good and episodes were of decent length to keep you going. Background scores have all been my favourite at different times. Show has a very poetic ending, all in all its a Must Watch!!	read plot enough pull really keep go martha jessica gun nail every bite raw emotion craziness character beautifully eye expression whenever screen awstruck see enough creepy know really happen someone leave u thrill richard gadd also play lead part well along support cast appreciate gun enough word storytelle good episode decent length keep go background score favourite different time show poetic end must watch
0	Whilst the story mostly held my attention and I watched most of the episodes, I came away from watching Baby Reindeer feeling conned. Whilst I appreciate that the making of this series may have been somewhat cathartic for the narcissistic protagonist, actor, and writer, it was so self indulgent as to feel offensive to the viewer.Follow along as Donny Dun (Richard Gadd) makes every possible wrong move and bad decision in EVERY SINGLE situation, largely due to his rampant self-absorbed narcissism, and then wonders why his life is so screwed up.It comes to something when the 'victim' of one of the most bonkers stalkers you could imagine is MORE mentally unhinged than the perpetrator.Overall - some good acting, but too long, too self indulgent and not a single likeable or sympathetic character to be found.(Oh, and in this series Richard Gadd uses the term 'heteronormative' unironically....make of that what you will).	whilst story mostly hold attention watch episode come away watch baby reindeer feel con whilst appreciate make series may somewhat cathartic narcissistic protagonist actor writer self indulgent feel offensive viewer follow along donny dun richard gadd make every possible wrong move bad decision every single situation largely due rampant self absorb narcissism wonder life screw come something victim one bonker stalker could imagine mentally unhinge perpetrator overall good act long self indulgent single likeable sympathetic character find oh series richard gadd use term heteronormative unironically make
2	I've watched all eight episodes of Fallout and I have been pleasantly surprised. This show does a really good job of nailing the feel of the games, with it's mix of gore and wacky humour.All three protaganists are interesting to watch but I particularly liked The Ghoul, who had a strong backstory, and the Vault Dweller, who's naivety made for quite a few laughs.The locations in the show were styled on the game and were true to the game. Although, they were all smaller locations. There were no wanderings in large, destroyed cities. I guess that would have meant a bigger CGi budget, so it's understandable.Also, it would have been nice if there was more danger in the wasteland created by the multitude of creatures from the game. This felt a bit neglected in the show. Again, I suspect this would have added to the budget. Perhaps these small quibbles could be rectified in Season 2. Surely there will be a Season 2 as this first season is surely going to be a success.I absolutely loved the way the plot threads came together in the last episode. It was really satisfying and leaves room for the story to continue.One last point. I've played and been a fan of all the games over the past few decades and find the 1-star reviews from fans of the game to be very strange. What are your expectations? You have to give the writers the chance to tell a story about characters in the Fallout World and they've done that very well. The set designers, costume artists, etc have nailed the style too, so how can this be a 1-star show? Insanity!	watch eight episode fallout pleasantly surprise show really good job nail feel game mix gore wacky humour three protaganist interest watch particularly like ghoul strong backstory vault dweller naivety make quite laugh location show style game true game although small location wander large destroy city guess would mean big cgi budget understandable also would nice danger wasteland create multitude creature game feel bite neglect show suspect would add budget perhaps small quibble could rectify season surely season first season surely go success absolutely love way plot thread come together last episode really satisfy leave room story continue one last point play fan game past decade find star review fan game strange expectation give writer chance tell story character fallout world do well set designer costume artist etc nail style star show insanity
1	The show is honestly a good watch if you want something light hearted. But after season 2 the show just falls of so hard, and by season 4 i couldnt watch more. Why am i watching patrol cops trying to rescue a kidnapped police officer in another country, its just to surrealistic and there is many times in all seasons it feels kinda silly. Like why are rookie patrol cops leading cia house break ins, etc.. i also just wanna point out that at times i feel like the show is just to political correct. The head of the patrol cops is just so perfect no matter whats happen'd or the tookies as doing and towards the end its kinda sickening.	show honestly good watch want something light hearted season show fall hard season could not watch watch patrol cop try rescue kidnap police officer another country surrealistic many time season feel kinda silly like rookie patrol cop lead cia house break in etc also wan na point time feel like show political correct head patrol cop perfect matter what s happen tookie towards end kinda sicken

1	Everything in this serial is portrayed under a woman's fantasy. All men behave as most women ideally imagine behaving in similar situations. Usually the bad guy or the unstable is a man. All the woman are strong independent young and beautiful and have friendly relationships with other womens strong and meaningful for many many years. Also the sexual and ethnicity diversity is so abnormal and completely fictional even with the standard of United States. Maybe because of all the both reasons this serial is so popular.	everything serial portray woman fantasy man behave woman ideally imagine behave similar situation usually bad guy unstable man woman strong independent young beautiful friendly relationship women strong meaningful many many year also sexual ethnicity diversity abnormal completely fictional even standard unite state maybe reason serial popular

1	The show started out good for seasons 1 and 2. Season 3 got too woke and political... and season 4 has improved a little but don't get me started on the character of Bailey Noonan (Fillions characters girlfriend) Lack of chemistry and credibility of all the things this woman is supposed to be ( firefighter, national reserve etc) is too stupid. This actress (Jenna Dewan) can't act to save her life! Absolutely hate her!Fillions acting is nothing new. He's the same persona in most of his work. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved his character and show Castle!The storylines and acting of the supporting actor are so much better.And they keep inviting really unlikable guest stars in very implausible roles! Like Niecy Nash! Jeez she is so annoying! The 2 episodes she was in were really excruciating to watch!

1	"Final Episode:If these producers and their production team is going to take on Star Wars for Disney, expect hope filled promos and absolutely saccharin fulfillment. After Jon Snow kills off Daenerys at the simple behest of Tyrion and the dragon burns the evil throne, I had had enough. The dragon took out it's angst by burning a chair? Pleeeeeease! These writers and producers should be fined and jailed for misappropriation of creativity under the guise of story telling. JRR must be fuming as are all who followed what turned out to be a mass of misdirection, bad writing and sophomoric plot lines that mostly went nowhere.Here are a couple of glaring examples: Arya Stark is on a mission to kill the queen. Plot line forgotten. Jon Snow is really a Targarian. Plot line forgotten. Bram, who can't be a ruler because he's the 3-eyed crow and can see everything, suddenly becomes the ruler because he can't have kids? Plot line forgotten and twisted to get an ending that didn't lead people to expect anything more. There are other Starks but Sansa is queen of the north? Horrible outcome. Arya goes on an adventure to the West just because no one has ever gone there before? In Westros, the world must be as flat as the flat-earther's say it is because one would suspect she's going to fall off the edge. What happened to the Citadel? They were the only guys to get it right: They had been there for thousands of years and had survived the Ice Walkers before. Why would Samwell ever think the world would end if they didn't do something? Indeed, the Ice Walkers went down rather easily at the hands of a young girl who had a great character stripped from her by absolutely stupid, egotistical producers and writers who were looking to get out of this thing while leaving the prospects for spin-offs. What a colossal joke on what could have been a real theatrical and artistic statement.The show ends with Jon going off with the Wildlings who he had befriended and saved for the most part, from the Ice Walkers. Here's how the show should have ended:Sansa Stark heads north with soldiers she brought. Arya killed Daenarys and is exiled so she is sent to the West where supposedly boogy-men and monsters exist. Jon goes back to the wreck of Ft. Black, discovers it's a total mess and heads off with the Wildlings.Then Tyrion and the others sit down at a boring meeting and try to figure out how to rebuild Kings Landing and manage crops, what's left of the military and how to run the day-in-day-out operations of a large society of people interdependent on each other. Somebody is going to have to clean up and get rid of all the bodies and restore a semblance of sanity so people can repopulate. Food has to come from somewhere and it's important to get those brothels going again. That would have been fitting. Forty-five minutes of a tedious business meeting to cap off two seasons where no creativity took place and where producers and writers were so out of their league that a 13-year old middle school student could have done better.I'm going to take a segue here to the battle with the Ice Walkers. Here is the beginning of the battle. Daenarys has allowed the Dothraki (sp) to be in the front lines. They are going to charge at the Army of the Dead estimated to be some 500K strong. Nobody thinks to have any kind of strategy. They rush off into battle with creatures who can't be killed and if they get killed themselves, come back as soldiers in the Dead Army. So let them rush headlong into the fight as if this is going to accomplish the ultimate goal of getting the Ice Walker King in front of Bram who is bait that the Ice Walker King can't resist because he touched him once?The only thing affirmed by this battle and many of the others fought was the absolute superiority of Air Power agains light infantry of any kind. Overall, whoever stages those battles should be fined for misrepresentation of skill.Penultimate Episode:I don't have any idea what the writers and producers were thinking. It must have been something like this: ""Hey, we've made a lot of money so far so let's pull the plug on any creative idea or concept of conflict resolution, pocket our cash and get out of Dodge before the stupid audience figures out that we are totally ripping them off.Somehow, the creative side of this series managed to take a compelling story with some minor episodic flaws that left me groaning and turned the series into a woman's year memorial into how insipid are men around powerful women.This series has turned into a colossal joke and parody of itself. One striking moment had Brothers fighting it out similar to the light saber scenes from ""Revenge of the Sith.""They somehow managed to turn one of the more compelling female roles, that of Arya Stark into a weak screaming little girl faced with her own mortality. Gone is the revenge-seeking heroine who slayed the Ice Walker King and Walter Frey and all his kind and survived the ego-bruising initiation into the so-called ""league"" of assassins and who survived endless situations that would have driven most people mad, like loosing her sight and the beheading of her own father. Now we find that the creative non-geniuses in charge of character development have managed to stick her into the Devolvement machine from ""Mario Bros."" and eliminate all her life experience and reduce her to a sniveling little girl running for her life. It's not only bad conceptually but insulting.Forget that there is not one whit of military strategy that could win any battle and people survive in situations they shouldn't. Jaime should have died several times and dead come back to life in Westros but that's episodic TV. It's medieval ""Supernatural"" in the foolish plot contrivances. But that can be forgiven.What can't be forgiven is turning a good, compelling story into a ""Dungeons and Dragons"" remake without the humor of the original. I watched with some degree of expectation that the developers of such characters as Samwell and the Lanisters could resolve the potential final battles with some degree of sophistication. But, alas, they didn't and they have played a colossal joke on a pretty devoted audience.I rate this five starts because before these last two seasons, a pretty good story was unfolding and that kept me and a lot of people watching. All I can ask is: ""What the hell happened?"""	final episode producer production team go take star war disney expect hope fill promos absolutely saccharin fulfillment jon snow kill daenery simple behest tyrion dragon burn evil throne enough dragon take angst burn chair pleeeeeease writer producer fin jail misappropriation creativity guise story tell jrr must fume follow turn mass misdirection bad write sophomoric plot line mostly go nowhere couple glare example arya stark mission kill queen plot line forget jon snow really targarian plot line forget bram ruler eye crow see everything suddenly become ruler kid plot line forget twist get end lead people expect anything stark sansa queen north horrible outcome arya go adventure west one ever go westros world must flat flat earther say one would suspect go fall edge happen citadel guy get right thousand year survive ice walker would samwell ever think world would end something indeed ice walker go rather easily hand young girl great character strip absolutely stupid egotistical producer writer look get thing leave prospect spin off colossal joke could real theatrical artistic statement show end jon go wildling befriend save part ice walker show end sansa stark head north soldier bring arya kill daenarys exile send west supposedly boogy man monster exist jon go back wreck ft black discover total mess head wildling tyrion other sit bore meet try figure rebuild king land manage crop leave military run day day operation large society people interdependent somebody go clean get rid body restore semblance sanity people repopulate food come somewhere important get brothel go would fit forty five minute tedious business meet cap two season creativity take place producer writer league year old middle school student could do well go take segue battle ice walker begin battle daenary allow dothraki sp front line go charge army dead estimate k strong nobody think kind strategy rush battle creature kill get kill come back soldier dead army let rush headlong fight go accomplish ultimate goal get ice walker king front bram bait ice walker king resist touch thing affirm battle many other fight absolute superiority air power again light infantry kind overall whoever stag battle fin misrepresentation skill penultimate episode idea writer producer think must something like hey make lot money far let pull plug creative idea concept conflict resolution pocket cash get dodge stupid audience figure totally rip somehow creative side series manage take compel story minor episodic flaw leave groan turn series woman year memorial insipid man around powerful woman series turn colossal joke parody one strike moment brother fight similar light saber scene revenge sith somehow manage turn one compel female role arya stark weak scream little girl face mortality go revenge seek heroine slay ice walker king walter frey kind survive ego bruise initiation call league assassin survive endless situation would drive people mad like loose sight behead father find creative non genius charge character development manage stick devolvement machine mario bros eliminate life experience reduce snivel little girl run life bad conceptually insult forget one whit military strategy could win battle people survive situation jaime die several time dead come back life westros episodic tv medieval supernatural foolish plot contrivance forgive forgive turn good compel story dungeon dragon remake without humor original watch degree expectation developer character samwell lanister could resolve potential final battle degree sophistication ala play colossal joke pretty devote audience rate five start last two season pretty good story unfold keep lot people watch ask hell happen
2	Grey's anatomy is, maybe, the best program about doctors that I have seen. It has an agile and very entertaining pace. It is incredible since the rarest cases of the medicine happen inside the hospital. The dialogues also are intelligent with a fabulous dose of humor to enjoy during a complete hour the program.The better thing is the personal drama of the protagonists, headed by Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), his relation with Shepherd; but, in my personal taste, I prefer the pretty Izzie (KatherineHeighl) that can be so charming as unbearable.Brilliant!	grey anatomy maybe good program doctor see agile entertain pace incredible since rare case medicine happen inside hospital dialogue also intelligent fabulous dose humor enjoy complete hour program well thing personal drama protagonist head meredith grey ellen pompeo relation shepherd personal taste prefer pretty izzie katherineheighl charm unbearable brilliant
2	"At the beginning, I didn't think I would like this show. I've been a daytime (and night-time, in the 80's) soap fan of long standing, and was getting off on Desperate Housewives, when GA came on the screen. At first glance, it seemed like yet another lame attempt at ""diversity"" for diversity's sake and besides, who needed yet another medical drama?But.Like a train wreck, I couldn't take my eyes off the scene. The acting seemed competent, as did the directing, yet there was clearly something more at work here. It took a few weeks before I actually watched an entire episode from start to finish, and soon after, GA joined the must-see list and was added to my weekly DVR rotation.Simply put, this show brings out nearly every emotion that television is capable of conjuring up. It's been described as a medical soap, and yes, that is accurate, but it goes beyond that. As with a soap, we start to care more and more about the characters, and each one is well fleshed out. Even newcomers can join the cast and are quickly grafted onto the whole. The level of drama has reached some incredible heights, what with the ""code black"" double episode of a few weeks back. You start to wonder if they can top themselves. Somehow, I think they will. The season finale promises to do just that. If you are new to GA, I suggest you record this show before viewing. The dialog and action sometimes moves at a frenetic pace and you will miss key elements if your mind wanders even for ten seconds.At this point, I cannot imagine my television viewing without Meredith, Yang, Burke, Shepard, O'Malley, Bailey, et al. Far beyond merely competent actors, they seem like old friends after less than a year. ABC has created something wonderful here. I just hope it can last."	begin think would like show daytime night time soap fan long stand get desperate housewife ga come screen first glance seem like yet another lame attempt diversity diversity sake besides need yet another medical drama like train wreck take eye scene act seem competent direct yet clearly something work take week actually watch entire episode start finish soon ga join must see list add weekly dvr rotation simply put show bring nearly every emotion television capable conjure describe medical soap yes accurate go beyond soap start care character one well flesh even newcomer join cast quickly graft onto whole level drama reach incredible height code black double episode week back start wonder top somehow think season finale promise new ga suggest record show view dialog action sometimes move frenetic pace miss key element mind wander even ten second point imagine television view without meredith yang burke shepard malley bailey et al far beyond merely competent actor seem like old friend less year abc create something wonderful hope last

1	As a fan of the game's the first thing I want to say the story was better than Fallout 4, but the characters did not leave much of an impression they were too bland except for The Ghoul and Lucy the rest were very forgettable, but The Ghoul really left an impression like he was a veteran from the games and Lucy was like someone first time playing but in a good way.They captured the feel of the world of Fallout exceptionally well, even the weapons which I wished to see more from the games but what they didn't capture very well were the monsters of fallout that felt lacking to me at least also the lack of a deathclaw was very disappointing to me.The Last Episode was kind a weird to me with the whole revelation stuff and the part with who dropped the bombs just felt like stupid writing to me and wished they just stuck to the lore.	fan game first thing want say story well fallout character leave much impression bland except ghoul lucy rest forgettable ghoul really leave impression like veteran game lucy like someone first time play good way capture feel world fallout exceptionally well even weapon wish see game capture well monster fallout feel lack least also lack deathclaw disappoint last episode kind weird whole revelation stuff part drop bomb feel like stupid write wish stick lore
2	Loved everything about it! Ella Purnell is brilliant and carries the show. Her fellow cast supports her in the amazing performance that she gives as they too feed off of her energy and give an amazing view into this enthralling story. I couldn't wait for her scenes, as Lucy made every moment a life changing step in her journey. Great story. Captivated at the very beginning. The characters instantly draw you in making the series that much more intense. I've never played the video game (I'm 49) but I see the appeal and would love to try and play. I love when Lucy keeps getting called Goosey. Such a great comedic relief to the intensity of the action packed scenes. I've already recommended to all my friends, who replied that they too had started watching the incredible new series. I can't wait to see what happens next.	love everything ella purnell brilliant carry show fellow cast support amaze performance give fee energy give amaze view enthral story wait scene lucy make every moment life change step journey great story captivate begin character instantly draw make series much intense never play video game see appeal would love try play love lucy keep get call goosey great comedic relief intensity action pack scene already recommend friend reply start watch incredible new series wait see happen next
0	This looks and feels like a parody or comedy, but it is really boring and lame. The non-stop songs from the 1940s makes it painful to listen to this garbage.I fast-forward through most of it, since it is one of those shows that fills up time by showing you someone walking every step from one place to another, so you can fast-forward a minute or two so they can get where they are going faster.Looking at the big eyes and goofy face of Vaultgirl is another downer. There used to be a TV series that featured a mongoloid kid. He could make that look work.A lot of the characters are just dysfunctional and pointless. There is not much going for this show, except the Ghoul, and he is just a standard chaos character.Whenever the annoying 1940s songs start playing, I put it on mute. Most of the dialogue is lame. This show is based on a video game, so dialogue is not a priority. You can guess most of it from just watching, and thus avoid listening to the horrible music.The music is all cheerful love songs and other cheerful stuff from the 1940s, so I guess it is meant to be sarcastic or cynical view of the post-Apocalypse. I guess most of that music is in the public domain, and that is why it is being used (for free). There are lots of cheerful songs from the 1970s, 1980s, etc. That would not be so annoying, but those are not free.	look feel like parody comedy really bore lame non stop song make painful listen garbage fast forward since one show fill time show someone walk every step one place another fast forward minute two get go fast look big eye goofy face vaultgirl another downer use tv series feature mongoloid kid could make look work lot character dysfunctional pointless much go show except ghoul standard chaos character whenever annoy song start play put mute dialogue lame show base video game dialogue priority guess watch thus avoid listen horrible music music cheerful love song cheerful stuff guess mean sarcastic cynical view post apocalypse guess music public domain use free lot cheerful song etc would annoy free
1	Idk how to describe it properly, but since the original casts were gone, the show was getting worse. The storyline is boring. There's nothing new like the old seasons. I remember very excited watching every new episode, I miss that feeling. You need to get Christina, Izzie, Arizona, Kepner, Callie back on the show. Or new casts. and hopefully their characters are being developed. Btw, Link and Shepherd relationship is probably the most boring thing I've ever seen in a movie.	idk describe properly since original cast go show get bad storyline bore nothing new like old season remember excite watch every new episode miss feel need get christina izzie arizona kepner callie back show new cast hopefully character develop btw link shepherd relationship probably bear thing ever see movie

1	"The first few years were AMAZING! It has sort of trickled down to OK and now I watch it more out of curiosity than anything else. To NOT give anything away, the main character, Meridith Grey, went from being this very dynamic believable flawed sort of a person that you could relate to and you wanted to see succeed. Now, she is this perfect surreal person that everyone idolizes that spews hokey nonsense and has somehow become extremely annoying in that she is blah and dull and boring. She lost all of her quirk and uniqueness and you long for the days when she seemed human and flawed and likeable.In the first few seasons, there were main characters that, while a bit stereotypical, had these flaws that made you sort of root for them to succeed.Now, you want the characters to FAIL because they are no longer likeable...they have become annoying and either so boringly predictable or SO unrealistic that it has become very hard to watch.Medically, you will CRINGE as the show does a HUGE disservice to people with actual illnesses like Traumatic Brain Injuries as it makes it appear as though people heal miraculously, setting the expectation that I REAL life, that can happen, too. I would really like to see a show address what it is like to have to deal with the REAL long term effects of some of these illnesses so the world at large stops thinking that actual people are supposed to also miraculously heal and the real world will stop getting annoyed at people who can't have these fake recoveries like they do on TV. Mis-setting expectations on what is supposed to be a ""real"" medical drama makes it difficult for actual real people sometimes."	first year amaze sort trickle ok watch curiosity anything else give anything away main character meridith grey go dynamic believable flaw sort person could relate want see succeed perfect surreal person everyone idolize spew hokey nonsense somehow become extremely annoy blah dull bore lose quirk uniqueness long day seem human flaw likeable first season main character bite stereotypical flaw make sort root succeed want character fail long likeable become annoy either boringly predictable unrealistic become hard watch medically cringe show huge disservice people actual illness like traumatic brain injury make appear though people heal miraculously set expectation real life happen would really like see show address like deal real long term effect illnesse world large stop think actual people suppose also miraculously heal real world stop get annoy people fake recovery like tv mis set expectation suppose real medical drama make difficult actual real people sometimes
0	"Although I appreciated learning about Japanese culture, traditions, and beautiful lands, this fell short of any of the early high rave reviews. I've given this a generous ""2"" because the writers used the word ""realm"" many times and that is my favorite word ever. Otherwise I would've rated a 1. Kudos!Now that we've watched all 10 episodes, we are let down. Throughout the season it was difficult to understand what the strategy of the end game. And in the end it didn't seem like we had an ending or even a cliffhanger. There is absolutely nothing that intrigues me to watch a Season 2. Nothing. Which is really disappointing given the amount of time we've spent watching each week."	although appreciate learn japanese culture tradition beautiful land fall short early high rave review give generous writer use word realm many time favorite word ever otherwise would rat kudo watch episode let throughout season difficult understand strategy end game end seem like end even cliffhang absolutely nothing intrigue watch season nothing really disappoint give amount time spend watch week

I am not a fan of subtitles as I find that too many give me a headache I also find that by having to read the subtitles that I am unable to properly view the scenes on the screen so because of this I will not be watching any more episodes.Many people have rated this program excellent but it's not for me unfortunately.I was looking forward to watching this so I am disappointed that it has not met my expectations.In fact it's an hour of my life I will not back.This is just the opinion of myself and my husband I hope that anyone watching it will come to their own conclusions.	love adaptation really struggle watch version fan subtitle find many give headache also find read subtitle unable properly view scene screen watch episode many people rat program excellent unfortunately look forward watch disappoint meet expectation fact hour life back opinion husband hope anyone watch come conclusion

This could have been an amazing 4 part re telling of an amazing story. But my word it was dragged out.Whilst there are no real shockers the acting is good and real tension is built and you enjoy the story unfolding. But the repetitive shots or back and forth and back and forth gets tiresome.I think you'd be better off watching the Matt Damon version and savings 8 hours of your life.you find your self wanting to skip chunks to get to the end.	beautifully shoot interest storey get though constant stair shot man walk man walk man walk back man walk could amaze part tell amaze story word drag whilst real shocker act good real tension build enjoy story unfold repetitive shot back forth back forth get tiresome think well watch matt damon version save hour life find self want skip chunk get end
0	"Let me tell you something. I've never read the books and I don't intend until GRRM finish all this damn books, If one day he will do it. I watched all the seasons up to now, and I intend to finish it, but even much I enjoy the show, I can't deny that the story taken certain directions that disappointed and displeased me.In the first half of show, the story had great twists and episodes really memorable and awesome as Ned's death, the battle of BlackWater, the Red Wedding and all the exciting fourth season. Unfortunately, there was a decline of certain characters in lasts seasons. Daenerys was an incredible character in beginning as a conqueror, but after she took power in Meeren, she's simply annoying now. All plot in Meereen was boring. And what about Tyrion? After he fled from Casterly Rock, his story seems to have lost its charm. The hard truth is that he's now just the shadow of the man he was. He was terribly wasted in the last seasons having been reduced to a mere comic relief. Arya, in particular, what the hell she did in the last two seasons, I cannot say. Her excellent and entertaining interaction with The Hound gave way to a boring and wtf training in Braavos, and the show lost a lot with that. About Dorne, I don't even need to comment. Was ridiculously ridiculous.As for the end of Stannis, I don't know what to comment either. The character had one of the worst plot outcomes I've ever seen. And Rickon Stark? He died as he lived: being totally useless. And even when the show was at its best, there have always been some freaking stupid and bizarre things that sound too exaggerated and out of place in story, which has a more crude and realistic tone in itself. I can easely accept the dragons and the ""mediumistic"" Bran Stark abilities why they fit into a medieval universe. But I can't stand Melisandre giving birth a freaking shadow that killed a Guy and then disappears like smoke. What? And there are the Zumbies and the arrival of the white walkers, that I never give a damn.This army of Ice Zumbies often feels shifted from realistic political universe in GoT. Seriously, this plot sucks.The positive points is that stories of Jon Snow, Sansa and Bran became much more interesting in the last seasons by far. It's cool to see Jon Snow standing in his rightful position and Sansa finally standing up for herself. Bran's character, by the way, has finally gained some meaning for me now. I hated him until season six, now I really like him. Hodor's death was touching and surprising. The Battle of the Bastards was epic. So, not everything displeased me.I don't know if season seven and eight will be able to lift the fun and surprises that were the first half of Game Of Thrones. The show feels somewhat lost amid so many changes, and seems to feel the weight of having lost so many interesting characters along the way."	let tell something never read book intend grrm finish damn book one day watch season intend finish even much enjoy show deny story take certain direction disappoint displease first half show story great twist episode really memorable awesome ned death battle blackwater red we d excite fourth season unfortunately decline certain character last season daenery incredible character begin conqueror take power meeren simply annoy plot meereen bore tyrion flee casterly rock story seem lose charm hard truth shadow man terribly waste last season reduce mere comic relief arya particular hell last two season say excellent entertain interaction hound give way bore wtf train braavos show lose lot dorne even need comment ridiculously ridiculous end stannis know comment either character one bad plot outcome ever see rickon stark die live totally useless even show well always freak stupid bizarre thing sound exaggerate place story crude realistic tone easely accept dragon mediumistic bran stark ability fit medieval universe stand melisandre give birth freak shadow kill guy disappear like smoke zumbie arrival white walker never give damn army ice zumbie often feel shift realistic political universe get seriously plot suck positive point story jon snow sansa bran become much interest last season far cool see jon snow stand rightful position sansa finally stand bran character way finally gain mean hat season six really like hodor death touch surprise battle bastard epic everything displease know season seven eight able lift fun surprise first half game throne show feel somewhat lose amid many change seem feel weight lose many interest character along way
1	Anything after season 6 is just bad. Season 8 was a waste and lack of anything remotely cathartic. It's one thing to try to subvert expectations but you have to have to writing to back it up. But hey I guess it doesn't matter when you get tapped for a Disney project right?	anything season bad season waste lack anything remotely cathartic one thing try subvert expectation write back hey guess matter get tap disney project right
1	Having started watching this, it didn't start off too badly. But got worse.The original premise of Nathan Fillion's character being older and getting his head round to eventually becoming a fully fledged officer sounded good and his character's ability to being somewhat a 'people's person' able to to sympathise and clearly has an instinct for seeing trouble as shown in the opening episode seemed like a good start.Issues with characters and writing: Alyssa Diaz's playing the typical angry latina and constantly pouting with her lips looked worse, especially now she's older. Titus Makin jnr was another person always pouting at every opportunity.Have you noticed in these modern shows it's always the same line being used 'I'm so sorry...' or 'I'm so sorry...' which sounds boring as hell, when seen many times across multiple tv shows etc.By the time you get to S3, you can see the dumb pairing a mile off. The way they wrote Melissa O'Neil's character where she's clearly playing a younger ditzy type with the playful cute nonsense got tiresome especially during more serious situations - her character's psychology and chemistry knowledge wasn't utilised enough and constantly looking for validation, just got boring and as others have pointed out during the episodes where her character is kidnapped there's weird writing choices with her trying to escape...All the female characters are written as bad ass, where as, unless they are snr or commanding officers, males are written as dimwits.Good Stuff: Some of the music during the more serious scenes with the low thumping synth/bass were pretty good, but just these parts.Some of the tactical stuff for a modern police show wasn't bad, specifically the weapons usage and movement was good to see, however there were odd choices with cover (coming out of cover that were strange.Episode 8 was great as examination of Nathan Fillion's character's mindset (yes, maybe not following all the correct details as some have pointed out, but gave enough feel from a filmic point of view).The veteran guest stars were great too see (not always about young pretty people); Matthew Glave as the sneaky offender alway looking for a deal or favours, his voice and supporting character acting are solid in the episodes he's in. Annie Wersching was really standout as the serial killer and her cat and mouse games with Nolan and team.Couldn't be bothered with it by S4, stopped watching.	start watch start badly get bad original premise nathan fillion character old get head round eventually become fully fledge officer sound good character ability somewhat people person able sympathise clearly instinct see trouble show open episode seem like good start issue character write alyssa diaz play typical angry latina constantly pout lip look bad especially old titus makin jnr another person always pout every opportunity notice modern show always line use sorry sorry sound bore hell see many time across multiple tv show etc time get see dumb pair mile way write melissa neil character clearly play young ditzy type playful cute nonsense get tiresome especially serious situation character psychology chemistry knowledge utilise enough constantly look validation get bore other point episode character kidnap weird write choice try escape female character write bad ass unless snr command officer male write dimwit good stuff music serious scene low thump synth bass pretty good part tactical stuff modern police show bad specifically weapon usage movement good see however odd choice cover come cover strange episode great examination nathan fillion character mindset yes maybe follow correct detail point give enough feel filmic point view veteran guest star great see always young pretty people matthew glave sneaky offender alway look deal favour voice support character act solid episode annie wersche really standout serial killer cat mouse game nolan team bother stop watch
1	Shogun is one of my all-time-favourite novels, but this is so wildly divergent from the original text that it can barely claim to be an adaptation. With all the money that Disney have thrown at it, which is undoubtably visible in the lush production values, it is a shame that they didn't spend more on a better scriptwriter. All the nuance of the original source has been lost. I can accept that TV is different from literature and that some elements need to be cut or curtailed, but here they have excised huge, vital swathes of the original; they kill off major characters who aren't supposed to die at all, and have imbued others with personalities entirely at odds with who they should be. I cannot lay any blame at the feet of the generally excellent cast (except the woefully miscast Cosmo Jarvis), but this is so confusingly and shamefully at odds with the source that it makes me almost yearn for the Richard Chamberlain version. If you want to see feudal Japan done better/properly watch 'The Last Samurai' or, better still, the sublime 'The Seven Samurai'. This is a disgracefully inaccurate adaptation of a vast, sweeping novel. Disney should be shamed.	shogun one time favourite novel wildly divergent original text barely claim adaptation money disney throw undoubtably visible lush production value shame spend well scriptwriter nuance original source lose accept tv different literature element need cut curtail excise huge vital swathe original kill major character suppose die imbue other personality entirely odd lay blame foot generally excellent cast except woefully miscast cosmo jarvis confusingly shamefully odd source make almost yearn richard chamberlain version want see feudal japan do well properly watch last samurai well still sublime seven samurai disgracefully inaccurate adaptation vast sweep novel disney sham
2	When I started watching I fell in love with all the characters but once they start leaving, I just feel it's so heartbreaking, yeah they have a life outside the cast but I really hope they could freeze world wide time and let all the casts continue. From the beginning of the show to the grey Sloan 6 was the most amazing episodes of the movie for me. Really wish all characters that exist the show do not die but rather instead relocate to a different city which would be great. A big thanks to grey's anatomy mermer, mcdreamy, Yang, karev, little grey, sloan, Amelia, lizzy, Weber, kepner, Avery, Catherine, O'Malley, Miranda, Torres, robbins., Addison, Burke, bokhee.	start watch fall love character start leave feel heartbreake yeah life outside cast really hope could freeze world wide time let cast continue begin show grey sloan amaze episode movie really wish character exist show die rather instead relocate different city would great big thank grey anatomy mermer mcdreamy yang karev little grey sloan amelia lizzy weber kepner avery catherine malley miranda torre robbins addison burke bokhee
0	Not only did the book suck, but so too does the series.The most convoluted and nonsense stuff happens.It really writes science from a perspective of not actually knowing science, so I don't understand why people love that aspect.It has some great scenes, done really well. Some interesting concepts, as with the books. But again, drops the ball with convoluted characters, poor understanding of science by thinking of itself smarter than what it is (the books were nauseating with this), and most annoyingly putting people forward as either smart or highly capable in their own right, then systematically making them act like a stupidest person to ever exist.Both wanting to paint 'intellectuals' as the best we have, but needing them to be drooling levels of dumb so that the plot can even continue in the first place.Benedict Wong is great. Honestly he was perfect casting, and nails my favourite character from the book at least. It's a Hollywood cast, and he is great.So too is Liam Cunningham. The two of them work really well, and are great when they come into their own.Side note, the Kiwi girl playing Jin Cheng mumbles so much, I'm so happy we have subtitles on.	book suck series convolute nonsense stuff happen really write science perspective actually know science understand people love aspect great scene do really well interest concept book drop ball convolute character poor understand science think smart book nauseate annoyingly put people forward either smart highly capable right systematically make act like stupid person ever exist want paint intellectual well need drool level dumb plot even continue first place benedict wong great honestly perfect cast nail favourite character book least hollywood cast great liam cunningham two work really well great come side note kiwi girl play jin cheng mumble much happy subtitle

0	Game of thrones spent all the time creating character arcs, building up the white walkers and world building, only for season 8 to come along and render all of that for nothing. For example they spent all this time building up Jon Snows secret birthright as a Targaryen, only to have it be for nothing. Dany, protector of the weak suddenly (and I do mean suddenly) hears some bells and a switch flips in her head. Oh and Bran can warg but he does nothing with it. But ends up becoming king. There's way too much and the writers clearly wanted to finish up this show in a hurry so that they could go work on star wars. Congrats, you ruined your cash cow. There is absolutely no reason to rewatch this series now.	game throne spend time create character arc build white walker world build season come along render nothing example spend time build jon snow secret birthright targaryen nothing dany protector weak suddenly mean suddenly hear bell switch flip head oh bran warg nothing end become king way much writer clearly want finish show hurry could go work star war congrat ruin cash cow absolutely reason rewatch series
1	In that it's totally unbelievable, but very enjoyable.There is almost zero corruption, they don't shoot dogs for no reason, they don't constantly claim to be in fear for their lives, 2-3 gun fights every episode, they are not obese, and they don't try to escalate every interaction.But it's very watchable. The Ebola scare in episode 20 was a bit much tho IMO.7.5/10	totally unbelievable enjoyable almost zero corruption shoot dog reason constantly claim fear live gun fight every episode obese try escalate every interaction watchable ebola scare episode bite much tho imo
1	The quality of this show is much better than expected. I have always loved Nathan Fillion in whatever he is in but this casting I'd superb in many ways. I want me a Tim Bradford but to be honest from the first couple of seasons. They have softened his character too much, in my opinion, and I am not entirely in love with his Romance with Chen. I think they delayed it at the wrong times and in more recent episodes it seems more forced. I believe the West family was done a grave disservice. I know the actor didn't want to come back but his reasons were unfounded in that his whole character build was about him being a black cop and changing the system, so it made no sense. He wasn't my favorite character but to kill him off so passively just did not seem right. I didn't even get to feel the heart break or cry. Just breezed right past it, then I guess because of the actor choice another terrific actor lost his job. I mean where is Captain West, IA isn't as important now or what? I also feel like there is no real fighting in the relationships, even your badass detectives get over a fight so quickly. Relationships aren't that easy and people aren't that forgiving. Smitty is a Gem of laziness and I am here for it. The newer cast are good but I almost feel like they went one direction with them and did a 180 and not necessarily in a good way, I hope the writers see this. I am not a fan of Fillions romance per say, it's hit and miss for me, I think its the chemistry is there one shot and gone the next. I can't wait to see what happens next. Overall I think the show is a winner. It's funny and dynamic, but can also bring a tear to your eye. I hope it continues with this formula and doesn't go completely left, maybe more drama with the relationships and how well people do the job. Well done to the show.	quality show much well expect always love nathan fillion whatever cast superb many way want tim bradford honest first couple season soften character much opinion entirely love romance chen think delay wrong time recent episode seem force believe west family do grave disservice know actor want come back reason unfounded whole character build black cop change system make sense favorite character kill passively seem right even get feel heart break cry breeze right past guess actor choice another terrific actor lose job mean captain west ia important also feel like real fight relationship even badass detective get fight quickly relationship easy people forgive smitty gem laziness new cast good almost feel like go one direction necessarily good way hope writer see fan fillion romance per say hit miss think chemistry one shoot go next wait see happen next overall think show winner funny dynamic also bring tear eye hope continue formula go completely leave maybe drama relationship well people job well do show

It's shot in glorious Black and White and you will see some remarkable shots and some cinematography that will make you say ""Wow"". Watching this I could not help but feel like Zaillian was going after an Alfred Hitchcock vibe and he has done it perhaps as good as I've ever seen it be done before. The supporting cast also shines. I think Dakota Fanning almost always does a great job and this is no exception. This series just looks and feels great. This is perhaps the very best adaptation of this great novel to date.

0	This show started off great. I was impressed with the uniqueness, plots, excitement that kept me on the edge of my seat, and the character development. Seasons 1 and 2 were great, season 3 was meh and season 4 is terrible. For some reason the show decided to dump the quality content and replace it with every political, and woke theme it could. I'm tired of shows shoving political views down our throats at every turn. Season 4 will be my last, I'm only hanging on for Lucy and Bradford and it is barely tolerable.	show start great impress uniqueness plot excitement keep edge seat character development season great season meh season terrible reason show decide dump quality content replace every political wake theme could tire show shove political view throat every turn season last hang lucy bradford barely tolerable

I love the protestant and catholic rift. I like the costumes and architecture. And I feel like I'm learning about japenese culture. I like fact checking after every episode. I learn a lot but it's just too much to digest. This show is too complicated and has too much talking in it for me to enjoy it with subtitles. Maybe if it was an action packed anime or a movie, but 10 hours of reading. Might as well just read the book! Too bad I was looking forward to it too.	exactly enjoy scene busy look bottom screen time trailer like fine love protestant catholic rift like costume architecture feel like learn japenese culture like fact check every episode learn lot much digest show complicate much talk enjoy subtitle maybe action pack anime movie hour read might well read book bad look forward
0	How David Benioff and D. B. Weiss continue to get jobs is both fascinating and beyond the pale.It takes a special kind of mediocrity to be given the unique opportunity to adapt one of the greatest sci-fi books of our generation and reduce it to this quintessential, mindless Hollywood garbage.Character development? Zero. Western adaptation? Sophomoric, clumsy and cringeworthy. Script? Mundane and uninspired. Pacing? Rushed to no end (you basically get half of the first book in 30 minutes).Look, there already is a Three-Body Problem TV show. Granted, it's from China, so there are many stylistic differences that aren't going to work for everyone, but it honors the source material, it gives both characters and story time to breathe and room to grow with the audience. It's a little slow and it doesn't have the panache or photography of a Hollywood production, but it's light years better than this.Do yourself a favor and do not watch this travesty.	david benioff b weiss continue get job fascinate beyond pale take special kind mediocrity give unique opportunity adapt one great sci fi book generation reduce quintessential mindless hollywood garbage character development zero western adaptation sophomoric clumsy cringeworthy script mundane uninspired pace rush end basically get half first book minute look already three body problem tv show grant china many stylistic difference go work everyone honor source material give character story time breathe room grow audience little slow panache photography hollywood production light year well favor watch travesty
0	Fallout is based on a video game that I have not played, and know nothing about, so I am probably not the target audience for this show. However, I do like scifi, and the premises sounded interesting, and it is, taking place in a post-apocalyptic world.The show is decently done, and visually it looks good, the budget must be substantial. The acting is decent, and the show is a mixture of three themes, the 50s, cowboys and future-esque. It is interesting to see these mixed together, but at the same time they don't really properly mix, but just co-exist mostly separately.The storytelling is very much from the school of video games, in the way that the characters are sort of introduced separately, then a lot of information is listed, and then they go on a quest. It didn't particularly appeal to me nor capture my attention, as a person who does not play a lot of video games. (Though The Last of Us was able to do this very successfully for non-gamers in my opinion.)The characters are flat. The main character, Lucy, is kind of annoying and unrelatable, with her completely unrealistic naivite and blind optimism. She doesn't really feel like a whole character, but just some form of male fantasy. Maximus is even worse, he's so flat and without any character trades that he doesn't even manage to be annoying. The Ghoul has charisma, and is interesting, but doesn't get enough screentime to hold up the show on his own.There are no interpersonal relationships formed really, in the first episodes of the show. It's just three separate characters, occasionally meeting but mostly just interacting and fighting with various NPCs, which is very boring to me, as a non-gamer. So it is very difficult to keep the attention.Finally, for me, the absolute worst part is the soundtrack. It feels very forced, deliberate and pretencious. 50s songs are forced onto scenes where most of the time they make no sense, preventing me from falling into the story. Then the songs suddenly stop and the feel of the scene instantly changes (because it never fitted with the 50s music to begin with), making the storytelling very discontinuous, especially in relation to the feel of the story, and emotions conveyed in each scenes. The future-esque music that is used for fighting scenes and exciting storypoints is very slow and depressing, and does the opposite of making me engaged in this story. So overall the soundtrack is just very annoying and/or boring to me, overbearing to the point that it rips my attention away from the story. (An exception of this is Johnny Cash, obviously, as Johnny Cash is almost always a good choice). From what I hear, though, this is a fundamental part of the Fallout-verse, and the music has so much of a presence, and its own character (peraps too) independent from the tv show that I am sure some people will love it.I admit this is written after only watching three episodes, so maybe it does get better. I just can't watch more of this show to find out.Overall, this is not a bad show. It was just not for me (which is Ok) and is probably more catered to fans of Fallout, and video games in general.	fallout base video game play know nothing probably target audience show however like scifi premise sound interest take place post apocalyptic world show decently do visually look good budget must substantial act decent show mixture three theme cowboy future esque interest see mix together time really properly mix co exist mostly separately storytelle much school video game way character sort introduce separately lot information list go quest particularly appeal capture attention person play lot video game though last we able successfully non gamer opinion character flat main character lucy kind annoy unrelatable completely unrealistic naivite blind optimism really feel like whole character form male fantasy maximus even worse flat without character trade even manage annoy ghoul charisma interest get enough screentime hold show interpersonal relationship form really first episode show three separate character occasionally meet mostly interact fight various npc bore non gamer difficult keep attention finally absolute bad part soundtrack feel force deliberate pretencious song force onto scene time make sense prevent fall story song suddenly stop feel scene instantly change never fit music begin make storytelle discontinuous especially relation feel story emotion convey scene future esque music use fight scene excite storypoint slow depress opposite make engage story overall soundtrack annoy bore overbear point rip attention away story exception johnny cash obviously johnny cash almost always good choice hear though fundamental part fallout verse music much presence character perap independent tv show sure people love admit write watch three episode maybe get well watch show find overall bad show ok probably cater fan fallout video game general
2	"I don't think I've ever reviewed anything on IMDB before (though it said I had a login so it's possible I created one and never went through with a review for something years ago), but I was compelled to write a review for Ripley. It is one of the most beautifully filmed shows or movies I have ever seen, and the acting is just about as good. You honestly don't even notice it's in black and white, there's such richness and thought behind what is shown. I could end this review with that, but I'll continue. If I had started it earlier in the day, I would have finished all of the episodes the same day, but I took two days. After the first few episodes, I was asked if it was any good, and just about all I could do was slowly nod my head up and down; I found the scenery, the music, the acting so beautiful, and I kept half-expecting the other shoe to drop and it to go downhill...It did not. I am an Andrew Scott fan, having enjoyed him in Sherlock and Fleabag (I haven't gotten to All of Us Strangers yet), but not an uber-""stan"" like many online, so I was pleased with his full embodiment of the role. His casting is absolutely spot-on; his shark-like eyes--big black pools that betray no real emotion--contain the multitude of lies that Ripley must balance. It's a master class in ""modern"" noir. I've only given it a 9 of 10 instead of a 10 for the sole reason that I fear other users will discount a 10 for being too effusive."	think ever review anything imdb though say login possible create one never go review something year ago compel write review ripley one beautifully film show movie ever see act good honestly even notice black white richness think behind show could end review continue start early day would finish episode day take two day first episode ask good could slowly nod head find scenery music act beautiful keep half expect shoe drop go downhill andrew scott fan enjoy sherlock fleabag get we stranger yet uber stan like many online please full embodiment role cast absolutely spot shark like eye big black pool betray real emotion contain multitude lie ripley must balance master class modern noir give instead sole reason fear user discount effusive
2	Apple TV keeps putting out great television shows and Sugar is no different. It kept me entertained the entire way through and Colin Farrell is as terrific as always as the lead. He plays John Sugar, a kind of loner who gets hired by rich people to find missing people. He's hired to find the missing granddaughter of a big time movie producer (James Cromwell) which leads him into a lot of danger and mysteries. There are plenty of good twists and mysteries to see if you can solve along the way. I'll be shocked if Farrell isn't nominated for a bunch of awards for his role in this. I don't think this is a limited series so I hope they plan on doing several seasons of this because I'm in.	apple tv keep put great television show sugar different keep entertain entire way colin farrell terrific always lead play john sugar kind loner get hire rich people find miss people hire find miss granddaughter big time movie producer jam cromwell lead lot danger mystery plenty good twist mystery see solve along way shock farrell nominate bunch award role think limit series hope plan several season

Season 1-46 out of 10 when they passed the books had to depend on their own ideas which were not at all in the same league as the source material but still tried to follow it in spirit... somewhat (no Lady Stoneheart should have been a warning to the audience). Seasons 5-6.1 out of 10 when they decided it was time to wrap up the series and realized they had no idea how to resolve the characters' stories so just turned everyone into one dimensional cartoons and threw in a lot of explosions to try and distract the audience. Seasons 7-8.Sorry Star Wars fans but these are the guys you get for the next trilogy.

0	"Being a real ""scientist"" I was hoping for some solid Science Fiction with a realistic story and realistic characters. When I heard people who were supposed to be scientists saying ""science is broken"" I thought this sounds like some political dig at the king of genetic mutations Dr F. But no they were idiots pretending to be scientists and speaking like drunken navvies in a whorehouse, which I find pretty insulting. So far a complete absence of science and no pretend scientist seems to have done their foundation course in metaphysics. The flashy CGI and crystal clear photography does not make up for confused mess of nothing."	real scientist hop solid science fiction realistic story realistic character hear people suppose scientist say science break think sound like political dig king genetic mutation dr f idiots pretend scientist speak like drunken navvy whorehouse find pretty insult far complete absence science pretend scientist seem do foundation course metaphysics flashy cgi crystal clear photography make confuse mess nothing

The casting also felt suited to a work of porn. Advanced civilizations, no matter how advanced, cannot defy fundamentals laws of mechanics.The hilarious title points to the maker's utter lack of common sense or scientific acumen. It is surprising a book serves as source material for this series. I now know the book is no good. There is one character worth mentioning though - the black scientist - who seems to be the only one who talks sense.	look erotica watch title look something meaningful worth time science fiction ludicrous unwatchable bad cast also feel suit work porn advance civilization matter advance defy fundamental law mechanic hilarious title point maker utter lack common sense scientific acuman surprise book serve source material series know book good one character worth mention though black scientist seem one talk sense
1	I like the series and think the Japanese actors are decent but Jarvis playing the lead role has no charisma and seems lost in himself all the time.Historical errors as others already said.Why the didn't cast a better lead? I understand the maybe want a unfamiliar face but why pick one without any charisma or acting skills? The didn't have a casting? This destroys the whole serie. Why not have a lead like Colin Farrell or Robert Pattison?Except the poor leadrole the other actors try but the story is many times both rushed or felt misguided. An exemple is when the look at the sunrise and we as spectators only see the actors and no sunrise. Many things in the story is actors telling instead of showing with places and views. Could be done bettter but I gonna see it through for I like samurais.Why should You give up 10 hours of your life with these serie? I don't know really and I hope Jarvis acting gets better or I'm putting the lid om this serie.	like series think japanese actor decent jarvis play lead role charisma seem lose time historical error other already say cast well lead understand maybe want unfamiliar face pick one without charisma act skill cast destroy whole serie lead like colin farrell robert pattison except poor leadrole actor try story many time rush feel misguide exemple look sunrise spectator see actor sunrise many thing story actor tell instead show place view could do bettter go to see like samurais give hour life serie know really hope jarvis act get well put lid om serie
0	I highly recommend the first few seasons. However, in later seasons the show took a departure from the medical- mystery solving and relatable characters that made it worthwhile and introduced a ridiculous amount of drama to the point where it can't be taken seriously. The death count among the staff of Seattle Grace is unbelievably high and the number of major incidents occurring each week just became laughable. The characters became annoying self- absorbed jerks, and the show became painful to watch. The later seasons completely destroyed the image of what was once a respectable medical drama series.	highly recommend first season however later season show take departure medical mystery solve relatable character make worthwhile introduce ridiculous amount drama point take seriously death count among staff seattle grace unbelievably high number major incident occur week become laughable character become annoy self absorb jerk show become painful watch later season completely destroy image respectable medical drama series
0	The show focused on solid plotlines that had tangible character development. Now for the third season there's a complete disconnect between the already established characters and the new preaching of Intersectionalist ideals shoehorned into the plot.I feel there's a ratio for an acceptable amount of propaganda and at this point id put this show on the same level as Veggie Tales. Sad, really.	show focus solid plotline tangible character development third season complete disconnect already establish character new preach intersectionalist ideal shoehorn plot feel ratio acceptable amount propaganda point i d put show level veggie tale sad really

1	*Written after watching the season 19 finale* Grey's Anatomy started as such an incredible show. It had heart, was clever, and really got you invested in the lives of each character. Each season got better and better for years as a world was created around our favorite hospital and cast members moved in and out of our lives. Watching an episode makes you feel that you are in the hospital, working alongside your friends. This was truly a treat to watch and I wish I could continue saying that about the current seasons. Around season 10, there became a drastic dip in quality. Many of the original cast had since left the show and were replaced with characters that had no character, just 1 or 2 qualities that ruled their existence. The writing tanked, the acting became subpar, and the characters all became shells of who they once were. It saddens me to continue watching this show as it now feels like your group of friends have all lost their minds in a disappointing manner. Each season brings my opinion on this show lower and lower and I yearn for the days before it went downhill. I would love for this show to get cancelled, just to finally put these characters to rest and stop desecrating their near decade long dead corpses. That is the most respectable thing to do at this point.	write watch season finale grey anatomy start incredible show heart clever really get invest live character season get well well year world create around favorite hospital cast member move live watch episode make feel hospital work alongside friend truly treat watch wish could continue say current season around season become drastic dip quality many original cast since leave show replace character character quality rule existence write tank act become subpar character become shell sadden continue watch show feel like group friend lose mind disappoint manner season bring opinion show lower low yearn day go downhill would love show get cancel finally put character rest stop desecrate near decade long dead corpse respectable thing point
0	The first few seasons were good, i admit it. But then it spun out of control..... they added new interns and the old characters left. When the first few originals left they should have stopped it. But don't get me started on the season where Meredith Grey was in a coma from covid. I stopped after the 5th season and i suggest you do the same. It used to be a medical drama but now it's a soap opera. It's just one scandal after the next. And the actor who plays Meredith looks absolutely tired of the role. The drama is stale and it needs to just end. All of this is my opinion so please don't be offended if it's your favourite show ever.	first season good admit spin control add new intern old character leave first original leave stop get start season meredith grey coma covid stop th season suggest use medical drama soap opera one scandal next actor play meredith look absolutely tire role drama stale need end opinion please offend favourite show ever
0	"Spoilers ahead (for this and other recent movies/shows).I just finished this. I read the 1st book in the series and was very intrigued by the premise.It started out okay, with the scenes in China. All downhill from there.It makes absolutely no sense if you have enemies who know every single thing you're doing and can control seemingly everything. Why would they let us get as far as they did? Why keep us alive? How did they not know humans lie right from the beginning? How did everything get built so fast? What the heck would happen to Will's brain? Why was Saul chosen?But all this is secondary to the lack of a resolution. I'm sick and tired of movies and series ending ambiguously, either because there could be a season 2 which may never come (see Constellation); or even if there most likely will be a sequel so they have to make sure you'll come back (see Dune Part 2); or because the director says, ""It's up to you to decide what the ending means"" (see American Fiction or All of Us Strangers.)

0	The first episode was a super ultra violent clockwork orange mess. After that it tones down a little bit and get barely watchable. However, people who love the video games, especially those who go back to Fallout 1, probably won't agree with the storyline of this.Citizens of Vault 33 are annoyingly California liberal. You would want to kill them if you were stuck underground with them. They are apologetic idiots concerned with stupid leftist garbage. The mutants in Vault 7 are preferable to the liberals even though they are doing evil experiments. At least they aren't liberal trash with mush for brains.One of the main characters (the cowboy actor who turns ghoul) starts out totally pro-American, get's talked into some communist garbage by a communist acting buddy.The whole storyline is one giant 'Capitalism is evil', 'communism is good' propaganda line of complete BS. So, that pretty much ruins the series altogether. There was no need to go down this stupid and ridiculous road. Val-tec has to destroy the world since it made the vaults and blah blah blah. Evil corporate greed destroys the world blah blah blah. And lots of empathy for the Hollywood commie crowd because of course in this story they were correct.... blah blah blah.So, the eye candy is interesting. A lot of the dialog is smut of garbage and not interesting and sometimes pointless. Story is kind of garbage really. So, the whole thing is Meh... so typical of something Hollywood (the real one in real life, not the story one) would produce and put out there. Hollywood, these days, has to ruin everything it touches includes stellar video game franchises.Watch for the eye candy if you want but it will destroy your love for the game franchise. This show makes me hate the vault dwellers.	first episode super ultra violent clockwork orange mess tone little bite get barely watchable however people love video game especially go back fallout probably agree storyline citizen vault annoyingly california liberal would want kill stick underground apologetic idiot concern stupid leftist garbage mutant vault preferable liberal even though evil experiment least liberal trash mush brain one main character cowboy actor turn ghoul start totally pro american get talk communist garbage communist act buddy whole storyline one giant capitalism evil communism good propaganda line complete bs pretty much ruin series altogether need go stupid ridiculous road val tec destroy world since make vault blah blah blah evil corporate greed destroy world blah blah blah lot empathy hollywood commie crowd course story correct blah blah blah eye candy interest lot dialog smut garbage interest sometimes pointless story kind garbage really whole thing meh typical something hollywood real one real life story one would produce put hollywood day ruin everything touch include stellar video game franchise watch eye candy want destroy love game franchise show make hate vault dweller

0	This remake of the 80s series is excellent, but it has flaws in terms of the actors.Actor Cosmo Jarvis was poorly chosen to play the great character of Blackthorne, previously played by David Chamberlain. It lacks category, and the type of aggressive and proud representation is not even real compared to the existing novel.Yes, it's a 70s novel and it doesn't have the whole truth of the whole story. The pseudo adventures of a navigator named William Adams.And the biggest criticism is the lack of existing multiculturalism. If the series has Japanese actors representing historical figures from Japan, the same should happen with the Portuguese figures. We see Japanese being spoken, a sad and ridiculous speech in Portuguese that is in English. But then we already have an American speaking Spanish and a bunch of sailors speaking Dutch.I don't believe the series will correct or improve this issue.Keep watching...	remake series excellent flaw term actor actor cosmo jarvis poorly choose play great character blackthorne previously play david chamberlain lack category type aggressive proud representation even real compare exist novel yes novel whole truth whole story pseudo adventure navigator name william adam big criticism lack exist multiculturalism series japanese actor represent historical figure japan happen portuguese figure see japanese speak sad ridiculous speech portuguese english already american speak spanish bunch sailor speak dutch believe series correct improve issue keep watch
0	Played fallout 3 and new Vegas and enjoyed them alot years ago but wouldn't call myself a diehard or purist fan so thought I'd essentially be the perfect target audience for this show.Apparently I was very very wrong.This show feels like it's trying to mimic about 5 different movies to create the effect of good TV but it misses the mark so so hard and comes across as uninspired, cheesy and so so cliche. There is not a hint of actual style or artistry in this. Every scene involves some shallow character overtly state some defining characteristic of themself (over some emotional music and maybe slow motion) before something bad happens to them which you inevitably don't care about because the character in question has no depth and the thing that happens is so hyperbolic, overly dramatic and honestly stupid that you are sat there cringing in your seat.Watched episode 1 and definitely don't feel the need to watch anymore. Jesus Christ Amazon sort yourself out.	play fallout new vegas enjoy alot year ago call diehard purist fan think essentially perfect target audience show apparently wrong show feel like try mimic different movie create effect good tv miss mark hard come across uninspired cheesy cliche hint actual style artistry every scene involve shallow character overtly state define characteristic themself emotional music maybe slow motion something bad happen inevitably care character question depth thing happen hyperbolic overly dramatic honestly stupid sit cringe seat watch episode definitely feel need watch anymore jesus christ amazon sort

The first episode. 3 bounty hunters are after a bounty but first decide to dig up a complete stranger from his grave with the hopes maybe he might help because hes been to california before. And its worth the risk and split the reward with a guy who was pretty much a goner. Let alone bounty hunters trusting a guy they dont even know .So they help him out of hos grave/prison and up getting killed for it anyways. Lol But Ok. So many Other holes in the story I dont feel like getting into.

1	Fallout has all the makings of a great show. It has a talented cast, a big budget, and a team of experienced writers and producers. But somehow, the show manages to be both boring and forgettable.The problem is that Fallout is all style and no substance. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes, and the plot is predictable and cliched. The show also suffers from a serious case of tonal whiplash, veering wildly from comedy to drama to action without any real sense of cohesion.As a result, Fallout is a show that is easy to watch but difficult to care about. You might find yourself watching an episode and then immediately forgetting everything that happened. It's the kind of show that you'll never binge-watch or even rewatch.It's a shame that Fallout is such a disappointment. With all the talent and resources behind it, it should have been a lot better. But instead, it's just another forgettable entry in the ever-growing sea of TV shows.	fallout make great show talented cast big budget team experience writer producer somehow show manage bore forgettable problem fallout style substance character one dimensional stereotype plot predictable cliched show also suffer serious case tonal whiplash veer wildly comedy drama action without real sense cohesion result fallout show easy watch difficult care might find watch episode immediately forget everything happen kind show never binge watch even rewatch shame fallout disappointment talent resource behind lot well instead another forgettable entry ever grow sea tv show

1	There isn't necessarily anything wrong with Grey's Anatomy, but the attention it receives is absurd. There is also nothing special about the show.The acting is fine, the stories are straight from a soap opera, and some story lines are just as unbelievable. The show is melodramatic and is really more about who is sleeping with who than it is about doctors.Overall, the show isn't bad, but it also isn't great. It is by far the most overrated show on TV, and as a result, a far superior medical show (Scrubs) is overlooked. This show is nothing special but I suppose it is addicting, if you're into over-the-top soap opera drama.	necessarily anything wrong grey anatomy attention receive absurd also nothing special show act fine story straight soap opera story line unbelievable show melodramatic really sleep doctor overall show bad also great far overrate show tv result far superior medical show scrub overlook show nothing special suppose addict top soap opera drama
1	I start watching this show without knowing it and the S1 and S2 was just so great! Every episode was pure fun and every thing felt so real without fake policing and stuff. But than season 3 came and wow it felt like it turn into a teaching episodes, How I should feel about certain things and every second character is offended from every second word a white person says (and I'm not white). Also lots of Hypocrisy, at one moment a person say to a white guy he wont get special treatment or any ease, and on the next the same person go directly to the Sargent and asks for his help only because she knows him. I fully understand the problems with the police and profiling, but too bad they took a great show and turned it into a teaching and lessons episodes. They should continue the same as s1 and s2 which also contained profiling and stuff, but it was reasonable and subtle.	start watch show without know great every episode pure fun every thing feel real without fake police stuff season come wow feel like turn teach episode feel certain thing every second character offend every second word white person say white also lot hypocrisy one moment person say white guy will not get special treatment ease next person go directly sargent ask help know fully understand problem police profile bad take great show turn teach lesson episode continue also contain profile stuff reasonable subtle

1	Grey's Anatomy is a great show. It has hundreds of episodes, tons of characters, and pretty interesting story lines. Surprisingly, they've been able to keep it up for 16 years! If you love dramas and romance, this show is where you should be. If you need a relaxing show in the evening after work, watch Grey's! I absolutely loved the show, and i'm currently watching it through for a second time. The characters you love climax in such a satisfying way. You really feel for what the characters are going through. The acting is on point, and the dialogue is fantastic.The only thing that I don't like about Grey's Anatomy is the obvious political bias. In several episodes the characters clearly state their political views in terms of a president and constitutional law.Give the show a go, it's worth it.	grey anatomy great show hundred episode ton character pretty interest story line surprisingly able keep year love dramas romance show need relax show even work watch grey absolutely love show currently watch second time character love climax satisfy way really feel character go act point dialogue fantastic thing like grey anatomy obvious political bias several episode character clearly state political view term president constitutional law give show go worth
0	"For Patricia Highsmith, homosexuality was a metaphor for deception and the orgasmic release that comes with death. A purveyor of existential crisis and anything unconventional, her novels and stories have inspired filmmakers of a similar bent, like Hitchcock, Rene Clement, Anthony Minghella, and now Steven Zaillian.An Oscar win and nominations for his screenplays, Zaillian has moved to the long form of the Netflix serial in this black-and-white retelling of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" abbreviated to just ""Ripley,"" although clocking in at over seven hours. The added length demonstrates, as it often does, that--while exhaustive--it fails to impress without staying power.In the role of the titular, creepy chameleon, English actor Andrew Scott effects a flat, non-regional, American accent like that of a 50s television announcer, and manages, somehow, I know not how, to come off rather asexual, especially for one who earned a reputation as having played a sexy priest. His counterpart in the plot's ménage, which includes Dakota Fanning as Marge Sherwood and Johnny Flynn as Dickie Greenleaf, is an actor named Eliot Sumner who plays second victim Freddie Miles, both suspicious of Tom and a bit jealous, too--jealous of his attraction to Dickie. Males with fuzzy sexual preferences interested Highsmith, and Miles is that typical blue-blood, Ivy leaguer whose sexuality falls on a sliding scale: think William F. Buckley, and a perfect foil for Ripley. Marge, however, was always a problem for Highsmith, who understood a lesbian, but Marge is a 50s housewife-in-waiting that's neither here nor there. She, quaint American debutant, is an obstacle in this: a usual object of desire, but disposable. Her misfortune is that she isn't killed, just bypassed.As to the movie itself, Zaillian wisely keeps the action in the past where, let's face it, it belongs: without social media, Facebook, iPhones, DNA, and color (except for one brief homage to Spielberg, his mentor). The result is visually striking, but more arty than artful. And without strictly scoring his movie, relying instead on sound that comes naturally, he attempts something akin to documentary. But thrillers, which this story is, as Hitchcock knew, do not work as documentaries (he tried that only once).All of the above is just part of what's wrong with this movie. It's also drawn out to exasperation, over extended with minutiae and obscure references to Caravaggio (one indulgent, gratuitous flashback), and as slow as a how-to for the obsessive-compulsive. Thank goodness for fast forward.Ripley is the all-American psycho, an original once upon a time. But his type has been done to death, and by actual serial killers (think Andrew Cunanan) whose lives have been serialized and movieized ad nauseam. Why are such killers fascinating? Well, it's clear why they fascinate writers, directors, and actors. But audiences? Leave that to the analyst whose employment depends on it. Writers, directors, and actors are doing well enough for themselves."	patricia highsmith homosexuality metaphor deception orgasmic release come death purveyor existential crisis anything unconventional novel story inspire filmmaker similar bend like hitchcock rene clement anthony minghella steven zaillian oscar win nomination screenplay zaillian move long form netflix serial black white retell talente mr ripley abbreviate ripley although clock seven hour add length demonstrate often exhaustive fail impress without stay power role titular creepy chameleon english actor andrew scott effect flat non regional american accent like television announcer manage somehow know come rather asexual especially one earn reputation play sexy priest counterpart plot nage include dakota fan marge sherwood johnny flynn dickie greenleaf actor name eliot sumner play second victim freddie mile suspicious tom bite jealous jealous attraction dickie male fuzzy sexual preference interest highsmith mile typical blue blood ivy leaguer whose sexuality fall slide scale think william f buckley perfect foil ripley marge however always problem highsmith understand lesbian marge housewife wait neither quaint american debutant obstacle usual object desire disposable misfortune kill bypass movie zaillian wisely keep action past let face belong without social medium facebook iphone dna color except one brief homage spielberg mentor result visually strike arty artful without strictly score movie rely instead sound come naturally attempt something akin documentary thriller story hitchcock know work documentary try part wrong movie also draw exasperation extend minutia obscure reference caravaggio one indulgent gratuitous flashback slow obsessive compulsive thank goodness fast forward ripley american psycho original upon time type do death actual serial killer think andrew cunanan whose live serialize movieize ad nauseam killer fascinate well clear fascinate writer director actor audience leave analyst whose employment depend writer director actor well enough
0	"I used to really look forward to this show! I liked the characters and storylines; I like the relationships and how personalities clashed with or played off of one another. The season after the plane crash was the last season I actually liked. Cristina was always my favorite character, and her scene in the bathtub when she finally speaks was brilliant and dark and that monologue describing what she'd gone through was so realistic. However, it was also the season that turned my annoyance with Arizona into loathing; she became nearly unbearably awful, her self-pity and self-centeredness made me want to scream. After that season, the show just got worse. I was especially upset that Cristina's final season was filled with so much middle-school level drama and B.S. that I couldn't enjoy her character during her last episodes. That season also made Meredith into a character worth despising; her pettiness and ridiculous rivalry with Cristina (who was UNDOUBTEDLY the better surgeon, seeing as she performed Burke's surgeries while his hand was injured) was a stupid development on the part of the writers. I found myself hoping characters would die off. When Karev became the most likeable character, there was really no coming back. The old characters have become boring in all of their drama. The new characters are silly tropes with under-developed personalities and backstories. Amelia remains awful. Plot ""twists"" have become predictable -*SPOILER* who knew Meredith would end up having a baby after Derek's death?! Everyone. Everyone knew. And I was actually happy he died because Meredith's immature anger toward him over the job she encouraged him to pursue was just infuriating. His death meant at least Meredith's whining and drama was justified for a while. The show needs to end. Because I keep watching it like staying in a bad relationship...I keep hoping it will get better again despite all signs and evidence to the contrary, but I'm committed and feel the need to follow through. Bomb the entire hospital. Nuke the entire country. Make some kind of actual end with absolutely no survivors i because this show just needs to die."	use really look forward show like character storyline like relationship personality clash play one another season plane crash last season actually like cristina always favorite character scene bathtub finally speak brilliant dark monologue describe go realistic however also season turn annoyance arizona loathe become nearly unbearably awful self pity self centeredness make want scream season show get bad especially upset cristina final season fill much middle school level drama b enjoy character last episode season also make meredith character worth despise pettiness ridiculous rivalry cristina undoubtedly well surgeon see perform burke surgery hand injure stupid development part writer find hop character would die karev become likeable character really come back old character become bore drama new character silly trope develop personality backstories amelia remain awful plot twist become predictable spoiler know meredith would end baby derek death everyone everyone know actually happy die meredith immature anger toward job encourage pursue infuriate death mean least meredith whine drama justify show need end keep watch like stay bad relationship keep hop get well despite sign evidence contrary commit feel need follow bomb entire hospital nuke entire country make kind actual end absolutely survivor show need die

1	A thrilling journey through the post-apocalyptic wasteland, capturing the essence of the beloved game franchise. With its gritty atmosphere, complex characters, and nods to the game lore, it's a treat for both fans and newcomers alike.

2	I totally binged this story of what started out as case of kindness overloaded that quickly turned to frightening boiler bunny stuff. The actors nailed their parts and I could not turn it off, .... wondering where it was heading.. only to find that it surrounded two humans with their own self loathing stories. A few twists towards the end, I loved it and would recommend, however, not for the faint hearted. Dig in. Watch over the weekend when there is nothing else on..... a learning curve.. every bit as emotional as it is intriguing. Not what I was expecting, but gave in and throughly enjoyed it. Recommended.	totally binge story start case kindness overload quickly turn frighten boiler bunny stuff actor nail part could turn wonder head find surround two human self loathe story twist towards end love would recommend however faint hearted dig watch weekend nothing else learn curve every bite emotional intrigue expect give throughly enjoy recommend
1	Looking forward to Season 6, Feb 20th... As with any tv Seashow, there are good and not so good episodes. Hopeful, that stories /writing will step it up and take us fans to the next level. Past season has opened up insight into other persons'. I myself appreciate and greatly enjoy an ensemble cast, use of all characters, learning about what has shaped them into them. I understand lead actor Nathan Fillion was used as initial hook but the writers should look or use other characters available to open stories and cases up because to be honest some of the cases or stories with Nolan are laughable example season 4 episode 22. Review past season ratings and there is collation. Season 5 improved in ratings in great part because of story lines, and of course Chen and Bradford. There are two detectives, Lopez and Nyla where show can use to bring in more cases, Nyla and Chen undercover. The Rookie needs to expand because focusing on One character is not sustainable. Example: FBI (3), 911 all ensemble cast and have strong base of fans/follows.	look forward season feb th tv seashow good good episode hopeful story write step take we fan next level past season open insight person appreciate greatly enjoy ensemble cast use character learn shape understand lead actor nathan fillion use initial hook writer look use character available open story case honest case story nolan laughable example season episode review past season rat collation season improve rat great part story line course chen bradford two detective lopez nyla show use bring case nyla chen undercover rookie need expand focus one character sustainable example fbi ensemble cast strong base fan follow

I read them all and honestly struggles to watch this show.Eiza Gonzales is SO unbelievable her acting is just awful as are many of the other performances. This just ruins the whole experience and makes it really unwatchable.The books are just incredible but this show does not come close to doing them justice - epic fail guys and Where the hell did all the money go??!HOW is this one of the most expensive shows ever made.? Mbe the directors salaries as there is very little expensive stuff to see.It's poor, rather boring and as already said the TERRIBLE acting just ruins it.I was SO excited to see this but it was horribly disappointing for me, it's doesn't come even close to doing the story justice.I cannot recommend watching this - READ THE BOOKS + Avoid this crappy show.	many good review people read novel read honestly struggle watch show eiza gonzales unbelievable act awful many performance ruin whole experience make really unwatchable book incredible show come close justice epic fail guy hell money go one expensive show ever make mbe director salary little expensive stuff see poor rather bore already say terrible act ruin excite see horribly disappoint come even close story justice recommend watch read book avoid crappy show

1	When this show started it was one of my favorites. It was light and funny but could also get darker. What it really made better then other hospital shows was the very good cast. Also the music added to the atmosphere in a good way and the stories were very good.As the years progressed and some cast members went and new good cast members came it still upheld it's status as a very good show; I kept watching it with pleasure.Now it's not as good as other hospital shows and all new cast members are B-list actors selected for their looks but certainly not their skills.Definitively jumped the shark.	show start one favorite light funny could also get darker really make well hospital show good cast also music add atmosphere good way story good year progress cast member go new good cast member come still uphold status good show keep watch pleasure good hospital show new cast member b list actor select look certainly skill definitively jump shark
1	What happened to this show? I tune in every few months thinking the writers will resort back to the simple, mostly medical based storylines of their patients but it's become heavily focused on the medical team's incredibly disturbing, depressing lives. Too much infidelity and petty drama that is no longer focused on Meredith Grey, which is formerly why the show was well watched. The newer characters just do not and will not fulfill the attraction that the original characters once had. They were fired by Dr. Bailey and now what? Nobody wants to watch the surgeons losing their jobs. This is not what the audience wants to see, just a repeat of every other original cast member who is no longer on the show.	happen show tune every month think writer resort back simple mostly medical base storyline patient become heavily focus medical team incredibly disturb depress live much infidelity petty drama long focus meredith grey formerly show well watch new character fulfill attraction original character fire dr bailey nobody want watch surgeon lose job audience want see repeat every original cast member long show
2	3 Body Problem is here and it did not disappoint. First of all I've never read any of the books so I have nothing to compare it to or be disappointed about. I can just take it for what it is and that's a really good sci-fi series. They've been talking about and hyping this show up for years now. The creators of Game of Thrones (David Benioff and D. B. Weiss) are the creators of this show to show that brings a lot of expectations with it. I'm glad they released it on Netflix so we get all the episodes at one time because I couldn't stop watching. There will be haters out there who live to hate everything but don't let that deter you because this is worth every second.	body problem disappoint first never read book nothing compare disappoint take really good sci fi series talk hype show year creator game throne david benioff b weiss creator show show bring lot expectation glad release netflix get episode one time stop watch hater live hate everything let deter worth every second
0	4/10 only because it looks mostly good. Poor casting, bad plot and worse thing is the script. It's like the writers and director overheard a conversation from some people who also overheard a conversation about the Fallout games. There are so many inaccuracies, not written or directed by true fans. Ghouls don't look like ghouls, they are too pretty. All the behaviors and dialogue of the characters are ridiculous. Everything that was obvious attempts at humor was not funny. Everything involving the Brotherhood of Steel is the most disappointing, I hope that some serious changes are made on the writers, director, staff and cast as soon as possible.	look mostly good poor cast bad plot bad thing script like writer director overhear conversation people also overhear conversation fallout game many inaccuracy write direct true fan ghoul look like ghoul pretty behavior dialogue character ridiculous everything obvious attempt humor funny everything involve brotherhood steel disappoint hope serious change make writer director staff cast soon possible
2	What a good start FX's (seen on Disney+) has made. Based on the 1975 novel by James Clavell, this story is based around the real life experiences of English sailor William Adams (John Blackthorne in book and series), a Royal Navy veteran, who became the first Englishman to reach Japan, and his rise to influence.With Spain and Portugal the great sea powers of the 1500s, Japan was little known, incredibly difficult to navigate to and closely guarded by the Catholic states, who were on a quest for riches. After the English defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, the Dutch and English, Protestant nations, allied against Spain and so Adams (Blackthorne) finds himself on a Dutch ship trying to open trade routes to Asia.From the outset this series takes us into 16th century Japan, in culture, language, politics, rivalry and intrigue. It's an excellent tale of differing cultures and beliefs conflicting but also merging, from Japan's rich heritage and tradition to the Catholic church's influence, not to mention the early antagonism between Protestant and Catholics.The story is rich, the production values, sets and locations excellent. We are only two episodes in, but one hopes the current standard in script and production continue.	good start fx see disney make base novel jam clavell story base around real life experience english sailor william adams john blackthorne book series royal navy veteran become first englishman reach japan rise influence spain portugal great sea power japan little know incredibly difficult navigate closely guard catholic state quest rich english defeat spanish armada dutch english protestant nation ally spain adam blackthorne find dutch ship try open trade rout asia outset series take we th century japan culture language politic rivalry intrigue excellent tale differ culture belief conflict also merge japan rich heritage tradition catholic church influence mention early antagonism protestant catholic story rich production value set location excellent two episode one hop current standard script production continue
0	"After watching this drama, there is no core, it is simple and crude, lacking scientific literacy and philosophical thinking.The play of respecting the Chinese scene in the original work removed the crucial debate on truth and thought in the original work, and only retained violence and hatred. Ye Wenjie's hatred towards the sun is even more embellished, distorting the original intention and attempting to express the playwright's own position. Ye Wenjie's true enemy is the evil in human nature. Her goal is to transform human civilization through the Three Body Civilization, rather than hating anyone, and she even admires the sun. ""We can only admire the advanced thinking of the highest decision-maker of the Red Bank project."" The scene of Operation Guzheng is also adding fuel and vinegar, changing the Judgment Day into a kindergarten, in an attempt to portray humans as villains by the playwright. The ETOs are frantically fleeing, seeming to express human cruelty. ""This is an immigration story, and humans are unwilling to accept aliens."" This is the playwright's attitude towards the invaders. And the special effects of this scene are fake, making people think it is an animated work produced by a certain company.The playwright piled up the chaotic scenes and forcibly cut them into a play, making the characters unable to stand up and without any memory points. I thought it was just a change of race and name for the original characters, but I didn't expect it to be a complete change. The roles were randomly assigned, the emotional scenes were mixed up, the comradeship became love, the ambiguity became passion, and I lost that kind of touching emotion, as if it were an undeveloped animal.Reviewed, xx is not working."	watch drama core simple crude lack scientific literacy philosophical think play respect chinese scene original work remove crucial debate truth think original work retain violence hatred ye wenjie hatred towards sun even embellish distort original intention attempt express playwright position ye wenjie true enemy evil human nature goal transform human civilization three body civilization rather hat anyone even admire sun admire advance think high decision maker red bank project scene operation guzheng also add fuel vinegar change judgment day kindergarten attempt portray human villain playwright eto frantically flee seem express human cruelty immigration story human unwilling accept alien playwright attitude towards invader special effect scene fake make people think animate work produce certain company playwright pile chaotic scene forcibly cut play make character unable stand without memory point think change race name original character expect complete change role randomly assign emotional scene mix comradeship become love ambiguity become passion lose kind touch emotion undeveloped animal review xx work
1	"I'm going to start this review by saying I know this isn't really an adaptation for those who are fans of the book and that's perfectly fine, And for those who haven't read the book or watched the Chinese version it's a serviceable show. As for those like me who've read the book and/or watched the Chinese adaptation it feels super rushed going from one story beat to another at the drop of a hat. A lot of the Character interactions and tension is just not there since the show moves way too fast for its own good.If you liked this show and want more 3 body I would recommend Chinese version, It's more faithful to the book but most importantly it gives the characters time to develop and the science aspect is more explored. The characters are just better but I know its harder to find unless you go through less ""legal"" means.Except captain Shi, They did captain Shi justice in both adaptation."	go start review say know really adaptation fan book perfectly fine read book watch chinese version serviceable show like read book watch chinese adaptation feel super rush go one story beat another drop hat lot character interaction tension since show move way fast good like show want body would recommend chinese version faithful book importantly give character time develop science aspect explore character well know hard find unless go less legal mean except captain shi captain shi justice adaptation

1	Meh. I was skeptical about the quality of this going in due to Netflix's abismal track record of adaptations, and the creators legacy on how they ended Game of Thrones (spoiler alert: terribly).As a reader of the books, the show just doesn't do them justice. It's kind of fun to see some of the more high-concept elements played out on the screen, but honestly, it was better in my head.I also don't like how they felt the need to make the main characters more relatable by making them equivalent to university third years. It felt kind of cheap, and the writing is very cringeworthy. The humour had no place in the books due to the subject matter, and to be honest it has no place here.Again, another example as to why 99% of adaptations just don't work.Netflix just never learns.Avoid, and do yourself a favour and read the books instead. They're fantastic.	meh skeptical quality go due netflix abismal track record adaptation creator legacy end game throne spoiler alert terribly reader book show justice kind fun see high concept element play screen honestly well head also like feel need make main character relatable make equivalent university third year feel kind cheap write cringeworthy humour place book due subject matter honest place another example adaptation work netflix never learn avoid favour read book instead fantastic

1	"In comparison, Tencent version 7/10, Breaking Bad 9.5/10 It is neither the problem of cutting Wang Miao into five roles, nor having multiple actors of different gender/race playing Wang Miao/Luo Ji/Yun Tianming...It is simply a terrible adaption and misses many essential merits of the book...don't do S2, don't ruin it. Please redo S1 without Netflix and without 2DBOk, positive sides. Some characters have good performance: Liam Cunningham, Benedict Wong, Alex Sharp, and Jess Hong. Yun Tianming (Will)'s role has a better build-ups than the book. Maybe it is also building the base for future Cheng Xin (Auggie)'s choice, but let's see. Also, I really appreciate how they have a faithful show of Cultural Revolution, which is core to Ye's motives but unfortunately censored in Tencent's version. All other positive things should give credit to Cixin Liu...Terrible things...a lot...there are so so so many logical and physical loopholes...are you kidding with audience or do you think most of your audience never finish high school STEM courses? I don't want to name them one by one...almost every time this show wants to divert from the book, it makes a mistake...come on, three body problem is a masterpiece hard science fiction, do you really think you can make a better adaption in those key aspects than the author?Next, cultural revolution and Mao's era. Yes, it is great to have some CR scenes, but the characters inside do NOT behave like the people in that crazy age (except for that female red guardian). I will talk Ye later. Bai Muling, Yang Weining (Ye's true husband in the book) and the almost-gone political commissar Lei perform like there is no death-threatening political risks around and look very chill...and how can they survive the CR like that???Then, Ye Wenjie. Both young and old roles are way worse than the Tencent versions, and they made her like a hateful woman and a true villain. How can this Ye survive in CR with her hatred? And let her sleep with Bai and Evans? This is deeply wrong and an awful adaption, but I guess this is the limit of Netflix...This flat and shallow version loses the depth in Ye, who is disappointed on human but also hold hopes for the human being. This role is core of three-body problem, if you ruin her, you ruin the whole thing.Also, the first book is supposed to be a sci fi thriller, and Netflix makes it a high-school soap opera in a super mediocre way...yes, it paces faster than book and Tencent show, but it missed so so so many important explanations, plots, and metaphors to build up the tense of three-body problems. Why do many scientists kill themselves and say physics doesn't exist? Why there is no billiard explanation about what is happening? Where is the turkey scientist and 2d animal? Where are the internal conflicts within ETO???The directors suggest that the adaption of this book is difficult and they want to simplify it for the sake of audience. But I feel that they don't really get the essence of the book and have no respects for the audience and the book. They just want to make money from a drama show, so they set a book of entire human kind and the whole universe on a few folks from a class and two policeman in UK? This is a terrible product of Netflix's data-driven strategy as they just want to gain more audience with a fast-pacing, terribly routined and expensive show from hundreds of other shows and short videos on the market. I don't believe there will be many book fans being satisfied with this show, and the new readers of books will hate this version later.

Of course, the investment in production, costumes and effect are evident, but the plot, with its very trivial 'political' hints simply is not enough to make this series what it is claimed to be. Maybe it is mainly intended for people under 18.Disappointing.	understand people like much really try watch could continue chapter course investment production costume effect evident plot trivial political hint simply enough make series claim maybe mainly intend people disappoint

Our advice; don't make the same mistake we did.The first couple of episodes aren't great but there were a few directions the movie could have gone so we stuck it out, again based on the 8.2 rating.The primary characters are simply bizarre and unlikable, with no redeeming qualities. The storyline could have been moderately interesting but it wasn't.The entire story appears to simply be a recounting of the writer's sexual/gender journey and the movie is simply a venue by which to share it.In summary, the movie is a big, steaming pile of reindeer scat, and avoid it all costs.	watch trailer read movie synopsis neither interest review compel take bait advice make mistake first couple episode great direction movie could go stick base rat primary character simply bizarre unlikable redeem quality storyline could moderately interest entire story appear simply recount writer sexual gender journey movie simply venue share summary movie big steam pile reindeer scat avoid cost

0	"The series falls short of expectations in several key areas. Firstly, the pacing of the screenplay is notably slow, leading to moments where viewers may find themselves disengaged or even nodding off. The background music, while present, could have been utilized more effectively to enhance the overall viewing experience. One of the major drawbacks lies in the characterization and performances of the cast. The characters often feel underdeveloped, and their actions lack depth, leaving much to be desired in terms of emotional engagement. This, coupled with what seems like a lack of direction from the director, contributes to an overall sense of disconnect with the storyline.

2	Stupid making, pointless scenes, what Happened to the Director's brain sitting in a freezer	stupid make pointless scene happen director brain sit freezer
1	I can see why some think this is a masterpiece, it sure looks that way when compared to most of today's film and tv production.The scenography is excellent, the cast is mostly good, and Hiroyuki Sanada stands out here with his subtle and excellent performance.There is seriousness here, interesting intrigues and fun characters. The violence is shown brutally, as it should be, because that is the violence in real life and it should not be embellished.The atmosphere was interesting and somewhat realistic, it seemed as if after many years we would get a real historical spectacle without the insertion of characters who behave as if they were from the present time, but unfortunately I was mistaken.The writers had to insert a maid who kills Japanese warriors as if they were nothing, when I saw that hilarious scene I knew that this series would be just another one of those unrealistic series that has nothing to do with historical accuracy.Today's historical series are mostly like parodies, this show has a lot of good things, but this kind of thing simply lowers its impression.The direction is good, the soundtrack is solid and fits well with the atmosphere of the series.Of course the series is not historically accurate, the script is sometimes a bit clumsy. Some expressions are too modern, as well as the behaviour of some characters, but this is the standard in series today, it unfortunately lowers the whole impression.I've read that this is just another series where the writers express their hatred for Christians. I understand why some think so. At times it seems so.The series is significantly different from the book and most of the characters are different, especially Mariko. They wrote her as if she came from the 21st century, so unfortunately it seems unconvincing.Toranaga is arguably the best written, with subtle characteristics to make the viewer like him the most.Feudal Japan is a brutal but orderly system, in which mistakes are paid with life, and this is well represented here. The relationships in society are mostly well portrayed, with some exceptions, but hey, at least this series is not a complete parody like for example Vikings: Valhalla.Mostly good and interesting, but unfortunately with the usual flaws. Nevertheless, this series is worth watching, unlike most of today's productions.	see think masterpiece sure look way compare today film tv production scenography excellent cast mostly good hiroyuki sanada stand subtle excellent performance seriousness interest intrigue fun character violence show brutally violence real life embellish atmosphere interest somewhat realistic seem many year would get real historical spectacle without insertion character behave present time unfortunately mistake writer insert maid kill japanese warrior nothing see hilarious scene know series would another one unrealistic series nothing historical accuracy today historical series mostly like parody show lot good thing kind thing simply low impression direction good soundtrack solid fit well atmosphere series course series historically accurate script sometimes bite clumsy expression modern well behaviour character standard series today unfortunately low whole impression read another series writer express hatred christians understand think time seem series significantly different book character different especially mariko write come st century unfortunately seem unconvincing toranaga arguably well write subtle characteristic make viewer like feudal japan brutal orderly system mistake pay life well represent relationship society mostly well portray exception hey least series complete parody like example viking valhalla mostly good interest unfortunately usual flaw nevertheless series worth watch unlike today production
2	A slower more nuanced take of movie version featuring Matt Damon with older characters approaching middle years yet aimlessly drifting through life.Actors are appropriately cast but 2 leads could easily switch roles and it would still work as both demonstrate subtlety of interpersonal dynamics, human fragility, and how we're all products of our environment.The androgynous looking actor playing Freddie lends an interesting twist as to why he's friends with Dickie when theyre clearly very different and seemingly have nothing in common aside from wealth.Shot in black/white the absence of color can be viewed as stylistic, but in this case it removes distraction of surrounding beauty forcing viewers to focus entirely on character interaction.	slow nuance take movie version feature matt damon old character approach middle year yet aimlessly drift life actor appropriately cast lead could easily switch role would still work demonstrate subtlety interpersonal dynamic human fragility product environment androgynous look actor play freddie lend interest twist friend dickie they re clearly different seemingly nothing common aside wealth shoot black white absence color view stylistic case remove distraction surround beauty force viewer focus entirely character interaction

2	"If you ask me what I advice you to watch, then it would be definitely ""Grey's Anatomy"". Now I'll talk about the reasons why this series deserves your attention and what are the disadvantages.The episodes tell the story about the doctors working in the Seattle Grace Hospital. I found the cast really ambiguous. At the one hand it shows us most of the aspects of the surgeon's life. On the other hand we see the personal life of the characters, their relationships and how they cope with their feelings. So, what I appreciate most is that the series shows us clearly the mistakes and problems that each of us can face in our lives. In my opinion the most obvious example would be a couple that I liked from the first episodes, these are Derek Shephard and Meredith Grey. These two have a rather complicated story.Speaking of shortcomings, I'd notice that often some relationships between the main characters become too long. For example, when we saw Meredith, overcoming her difficulties with her mum, that was far too stretched out.Anyway, this series can grab your attention if you're into medicine or maybe you adore dramas."	ask advice watch would definitely grey anatomy talk reason series deserve attention disadvantage episode tell story doctor work seattle grace hospital find cast really ambiguous one hand show we aspect surgeon life hand see personal life character relationship cope feel appreciate series show we clearly mistake problem we face live opinion obvious example would couple like first episode derek shephard meredith grey two rather complicate story speak shortcoming notice often relationship main character become long example see meredith overcome difficulty mum far stretch anyway series grab attention medicine maybe adore drama

The male Japanese lead is so tiny, he doesn't command the power as a leader. And yes I get it, they're in Japan. But this is meant for Japanese audience or for North Americans. Reading the subtitles gets cumbersome. Feel like a foreign series, The female lead is also ungrateful, speaks commonly and has zero star power. I get it trying to make it all authentic and realistic but as an audience I want to be entertained and all I see is dark grim unattractive people and nobody smiles. It gets tiresome just sitting through one episode.

2	I've read a lot of comments saying this is one of the best video game adaptations of all time. I don't know about that as I've never played the game but what I do know is that it's one of the best post apocalyptic series ever made!It's basically split into 3 stories which interconnect.There is Lucy, played by Ella Purnell, who lives in a community under the earth in one of 3 Vaults. No one has ventured outside since the world became a radioactive wasteland. But circumstances will dictate that Lucy will go outside in a quest to find her father.Then there is Maximus played by Aaron Moten, a servant assigned to look after a Knight called Titus. Knights are men who wear powerful suits of armour and are highly regarded and respected. Maximus has a dream of becoming one and that dream is eventually realised.Then last but by no means least there's The Ghoul, a mutant cowboy with a droll delivery and no nose. This character is destined to become iconic and Walton Goggins who plays him is faultless. He's funny, scary and ruthless in equal measure but has a great backstory which humanises him.The creation of the devastated world and creatures that inhabit it are beautifully rendered. It is visually stunning but the visuals are backed up by an excellent script and brilliant direction. The pace is just about perfect. The intertwining of the stories is expertly done.This is hugely entertaining and leaves you wanting more.	read lot comment say one good video game adaptation time know never play game know one good post apocalyptic series ever make basically split story interconnect lucy play ella purnell live community earth one vault one venture outside since world become radioactive wasteland circumstance dictate lucy go outside quest find father maximus play aaron moten servant assign look knight call titus knight man wear powerful suit armour highly regard respect maximus dream become one dream eventually realise last mean least ghoul mutant cowboy droll delivery nose character destine become iconic walton goggin play faultless funny scary ruthless equal measure great backstory humanise creation devastate world creature inhabit beautifully render visually stun visual back excellent script brilliant direction pace perfect intertwine story expertly do hugely entertain leave want

Enjoy the plots as well as the humor that is added to the plots.	love show dislike multiple scene show view body camera motion sensitive find hard watch actor character strong believable enjoy plot well humor add plot
2	Do you ever find yourself watching a TV show that has you sitting on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next? Many people have their favorite types of shows, but one of my favorite in particular is a medical soap opera series called Grey's Anatomy. With the action filled drama, to death, love, loss, and humor, it is sure to keep you entertained. The show has a few main characters, the main one being Meredith Grey who wants to pursue her mother's ambitions in surgery. More interns in the show are Christina Yang, George O'Malley, Alex Karev, and Izzie Stevens, just to name a few of the large cast. This entertaining cast is sure not to bore, whether you are looking for excitement or interested in the medical field, this show is for you! If you are really looking for a thrill that does a phenomenal job at showing the everyday struggles of doctors and nurses, you've come to the right place. Doctors and nurses are often people that we look up to, but during their 12+ hour shifts, there is a lot they experience. In the show, it does a fantastic job at showing things from intense surgeries, to patients battling cancer, and then of course, death. One thing that they do really well is to show the close relationships that these workers have to their patients, and what their recovery is like with them. One very negative thing that I and many other reviewers on websites like IMDb.com say, is that throughout the show, which is 13 seasons long, the main characters that we have become attached to die off or leave, which makes it seem like the whole cast and show is remade. Arguably the most important aspect of this show are the compelling stories that leave viewers on edge and coming back for more. Just some examples of the intense situations are when people come in to the emergency room with a big metal object through their head, a person shot who is bleeding out, a shooting in the hospital while patients are trying to be saved, or a child surviving or dying of cancer. Throughout these situations, viewers see the emotions, loss, and many other things while the doctors and surgeons are under a tremendous amount of pressure overworking themselves to save those they care about most. According to an article on The Atlantic, TV makes viewers judge the aspects of reality. In Grey's Anatomy, patients with the worst cases often survive them way more often than they would in real life, which can be negative if you are looking for serious medical situations, or good if you are looking to cry and be on edge. Another reason to tune into this show is the exhilarating story line. On websites reviewing the show such as IMDb.com, many users talk about this, saying things like the show isn't always serious, because along with being about medicine, it is also about relationships within the hospital. But when the seriousness is happening, the details of the show make us forget about that aspect. Of course, just like all shows or movies, they are compared to others within the same genre. There are many, many shows out there that are like Grey's Anatomy, such as Chicago Med, ER, General Hospital, Scrubs, and many more. Although these shows all take place in a hospital, there are many things that make them different from each other. It seems as though the other shows are a lot more serious, which some people do like, but Grey's Anatomy has a lot to offer. Whether it be the humor, life lessons, cliff hangers, relationship drama, or your emotions building up, it is for sure a spin on the typical medical show. The variety can be good for those seeking something different, but bad for those looking for medical seriousness. Overall, Grey's Anatomy is a show that will please even the most skeptical viewers. Of course it has positives and negatives, but the show really does a great job at portraying hospital life and giving life lessons. It is highly recommended for anyone to try out and get a feel for the lasting thrill it gives that will have you coming back for more, unable to stop.	ever find watch tv show sit edge seat wonder happen next many people favorite type show one favorite particular medical soap opera series call grey anatomy action fill drama death love loss humor sure keep entertain show main character main one meredith grey want pursue mother ambition surgery intern show christina yang george malley alex karev izzie stevens name large cast entertain cast sure bore whether look excitement interest medical field show really look thrill phenomenal job show everyday struggle doctor nurse come right place doctor nurse often people look hour shift lot experience show fantastic job show thing intense surgery patient battle cancer course death one thing really well show close relationship worker patient recovery like one negative thing many reviewer website like imdb com say throughout show season long main character become attach die leave make seem like whole cast show remake arguably important aspect show compel story leave viewer edge come back example intense situation people come emergency room big metal object head person shoot bleed shoot hospital patient try save child survive die cancer throughout situation viewer see emotion loss many thing doctor surgeon tremendous amount pressure overwork save care accord article atlantic tv make viewer judge aspect reality grey anatomy patient bad case often survive way often would real life negative look serious medical situation good look cry edge another reason tune show exhilarate story line website review show imdb com many user talk say thing like show always serious along medicine also relationship within hospital seriousness happen detail show make we forget aspect course like show movie compare other within genre many many show like grey anatomy chicago med er general hospital scrub many although show take place hospital many thing make different seem though show lot serious people like grey anatomy lot offer whether humor life lesson cliff hanger relationship drama emotion build sure spin typical medical show variety good seek something different bad look medical seriousness overall grey anatomy show please even skeptical viewer course positive negative show really great job portray hospital life give life lesson highly recommend anyone try get feel last thrill give come back unable stop
2	"As an avid reader, I am often disappointed by what is represented by the silver screen. I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. So when I saw the preview for ""Game of Thrones"" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time. If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. ""Game of Thrones"" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.UPDATE:I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation. Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week. A special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait. Even after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone."	avid reader often disappoint represent silver screen initially get excite see one favorite series big screen eventually walk away disgust whatever reason show movie base epic book series absolutely butcher original content see preview game throne hbo immediately skeptical oh go watch high expectation hold little hope hbo know high quality show absolutely shock watch pilot realize follow book almost perfection language use actor similar way write book event skip stay true story without add remove act superb actually feel like look winterfell first time feel like actually get face add character read long time read book may feel though blatant sexuality addition hbo add spice series case book contain sexuality show pilot proud hbo produce amazingly accurate product watch every week sure enjoy see pilot know many plot twist action fill even come game throne ton potential one great series ever produce would highly recommend fan series newcomer alike update watch episode want come back report even episode series stay true write story overall act still good hate watch show make look like actor read script get impression hbo adaptation episode series leave itch next weekend really hate watch show real time enjoy absorb several hour show one time good show keep look forward whole week special note viewer read book keep watch series numerous twist turn full epic battle action may seem like take little develop reward well worth wait even episode would still highly recommend anyone
2	As written and as portrayed by Colin Farrell, Sugar is a very original and fascinating character. He hates hurting people but he's very capable of it. He doesn't like guns but he'll carry one because of the insistence of his manager and because it's the exact gun used in a film classic he admires. Thats because he loves movies. Sugar is reminiscent of Chili Palmer, more introspective, but same decency despite the shady nature of their vocations, low key disarming charm that doesn't draw a lot of attention, same ability to intimidate without raising their voice, and the same love of film. Both are experts at finding people for their clients. Sugar is haunted by his past and there's a melancholy to his being even when he smiles. So far the series is engrossing and almost hypnotic in its smooth execution, but what makes it compelling is the central performance (aided by a very capable supporting cast) by Farrell as private investigator John Sugar.The case itself isn't remarkably unique, but the antagonists keep the stakes high and the danger present a real. It's the same type of down the rabbit hole looking detective case they've been making since the 1930s, but at least it's down with some style, humor, a bit of action, great work from a fantastic cast and cleverly inserted noir film clips. A definite recommendation for fans of the genre and fans of Farrell.	write portray colin farrell sugar original fascinate character hat hurt people capable like gun carry one insistence manager exact gun use film classic admire that s love movie sugar reminiscent chili palmer introspective decency despite shady nature vocation low key disarm charm draw lot attention ability intimidate without raise voice love film expert find people client sugar haunt past melancholy even smile far series engross almost hypnotic smooth execution make compel central performance aid capable support cast farrell private investigator john sugar case remarkably unique antagonist keep stake high danger present real type rabbit hole look detective case make since least style humor bite action great work fantastic cast cleverly insert noir film clip definite recommendation fan genre fan farrell
1	I watched the first 3 episodes but don't intend to watch any more. The show is very well done but the main character, John Sugar (played by Farrell, one of my favorite actors) is completely unbelievable.After watching the first episode I actually looked into the series to see if it was considered to be classified as science fiction or supernatural in terms of the genre. I thought for a minute that the character of Sugar might be some sort of divine angel sent to Earth to save people. Nope. Apparently he's a real human. A completely unbelievable real human.It's a shame because I had high hopes for the series, what with being a fan of Farrel, but I'm just not able to suspend belief to the level needed to continue watching.	watch first episode intend watch show well do main character john sugar play farrell one favorite actor completely unbelievable watch first episode actually look series see consider classify science fiction supernatural term genre think minute character sugar might sort divine angel send earth save people nope apparently real human completely unbelievable real human shame high hop series fan farrel able suspend belief level need continue watch

The scientists in this series are young 20 somethings? Wow! Are they all child prodigies? Or did Benioff and Weiss make this series only for young target audience? Anyway, the acting sucks. Benedict Wong looks amused all the time. Maybe he was wondering ""what am I doing here""?And there is no need to need to kill characters off a la Game of Thrones!

2	I'm not a read the show kind of person. I want to enjoy the settings and the action on screen. Not try to read everything and glance up once in a while to see the scenery. I'm 20 minutes in and I can barely tell you what settings they been to. I'm to busy trying to read subtitles. I get the authentic vibe you're looking for and wanting the best Japanese actors. Now have them dub their own lines if they can speak even broken English. And dub actors for the rest of the cast. There has to be enough Japanese people to keep the acting in country. If that's what you're after. I believe that I'm in the majority on this stance.I've waited very eagerly for this to be released and I can't fully enjoy the show because I'm forced to read it.	read show kind person want enjoy setting action screen try read everything glance see scenery minute barely tell setting busy try read subtitle get authentic vibe look want good japanese actor dub line speak even break english dub actor rest cast enough japanese people keep act country believe majority stance wait eagerly release fully enjoy show force read

0	TerribleSome notably egregious casting choices in this. First of all Freddie Miles - what the hell were they thinking? Ripley too, blimey! I like Andrew Scott a lot, but he's not right for this role. Dickie and Marge, just meh - not particularly bad, but not good either.Black and white, in a sort of saturation down, contrast up manner - doesn't work. It's also Italy - come on!!!! I'd have been fine if it was an old film, or it served a clear purpose, but I really can't connect with this particular decision.Far too much creative freedom afforded to the director here, in a manner that in my mind disrespects the books, in addition to previous adaptations and character portrayals. The director appears to have all the adaptation, writing and director credits. Had way too much creative control.I was excited about seeing this, however it became a painfully dull viewing experience. Tons of unnecessary padding.In any case the casting choices appear to have been deliberately blind, in such a way I can't get on board with them I'm afraid, in addition to which they just didn't seem to understand the source material they were working with.Most importantly of all - the series is utterly lifeless. I keep picking it up and dropping it. A key, initial death, involving a certain character has almost no emotional build up. You can appreciate how certain characters made themselves vulnerable to Ripley in the book, and other adaptations, but here no part of those relationships work at all, in the interests of giving any sense of emotional weight.I re watched The Talented Mr Ripley soon after this, and thank goodness I did, as I didn't want to have my memories of this story overshadowed by this horrible production. I've never appreciated Phillip Seymour Hoffman so much!	terriblesome notably egregious cast choice first freddie mile hell think ripley blimey like andrew scott lot right role dickie marge meh particularly bad good either black white sort saturation contrast manner work also italy come fine old film serve clear purpose really connect particular decision far much creative freedom afford director manner mind disrespect book addition previous adaptation character portrayal director appear adaptation write director credit way much creative control excite see however become painfully dull view experience ton unnecessary pad case cast choice appear deliberately blind way get board afraid addition seem understand source material work importantly series utterly lifeless keep pick drop key initial death involve certain character almost emotional build appreciate certain character make vulnerable ripley book adaptation part relationship work interest give sense emotional weight watch talente mr ripley soon thank goodness want memory story overshadow horrible production never appreciate phillip seymour hoffman much

How can one enjoy this series when such incredible scenery is available to behold? It may as well have been filmed in a cave.I don't understand why the main character cannot use his own charming accent while playing this role. His character is boring enough without adding insult to injury.Watched E1 and hoped it would improve but sorry to say, a huge disappointment of film entertainment.But, I will not give up on future film entertainment because once in a while a good one comes along.	italy one beautiful country world sadly series film black white one might even refer blasphemy one enjoy series incredible scenery available behold may well film cave understand main character use charm accent play role character bear enough without add insult injury watch e hop would improve sorry say huge disappointment film entertainment give future film entertainment good one come along
1	The ending of this series is a disservice to the public!The first seasons are great as they are based on the books source material and, apparently, the writers are good enough at adapting other people ideas. After season four there's a decline, not so manifest at first since the goodness of the source material still lingers around. It's more of a slow deterioration, a spiral into shallow writing that peaks in a last season devoid of content and value. Where at first grand scale developments, societal issues and world-spanning intrigues dominated the narration with characters being the pawns of the true overarching story, later in the seasons characters and stereotypical interactions take the stage and the interesting, long developing issues that made the story captivating get resolved in the most unrewarding ways possible. It's incoherent, detached, uninspired writing. It's everything that is bad in mainstream media.All of this because the writers decided they had enough with the show and grew bored with it. So they wanted to wrap it up as soon as possible in order to go on and ruin the Star Wars franchise (more than it already is). Thanks for your disservice!It needs to be mentioned that the overall production, sound design, acting, cinematography, all of these are quite extraordinary and elevate the show quite a bit, even when the writing declines. The quality is amazing. It probably is still worth watching for its entertainment value. It just doesn't pay off. The ending season ruins quite literally everything.	end series disservice public first season great base book source material apparently writer good enough adapt people idea season four decline manifest first since goodness source material still linger around slow deterioration spiral shallow write peak last season devoid content value first grand scale development societal issue world span intrigue dominate narration character pawn true overarch story later season character stereotypical interaction take stage interest long develop issue make story captivate get resolve unrewarde way possible incoherent detach uninspired write everything bad mainstream medium writer decide enough show grow bore want wrap soon possible order go ruin star war franchise already thank disservice need mention overall production sound design act cinematography quite extraordinary elevate show quite bite even write decline quality amaze probably still worth watch entertainment value pay end season ruin quite literally everything
0	The original book might be too big for average Americans, who are (quote from Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory) indicment of American education system. The original book tells a story about how all human beings behave when they know about the truth of universe and a all-mighty specis is coming. This adaptation has dumbed it down to popcorn- a small elite circle united to resist. Perhaps it's because Americans can no longer understand something big. To be honest.Therefore, the philosophical connotation of Three-Body Problem is dumbed down to popcorn that American audience can understand: all the characters know each other and are in the same circle. People all over the world only need to obey, and the elites in the small circle unite to save the planet.This is the classic American heroism and the elite view of history that abandon the social fabric. However, compared to the portrayal of these savior elites in the film, the practice of depicting ordinary people as background ants only further exacerbates the narrative flaws of the series. The small circle of elites with the most powerful voice brings suffocating American-style decision-making black box... In this case, it is also assumed that human beings unite to complete part of the wall-facing task. For the opposite reality, this plot is completely meaningless.The final display of the eighth episode shows that the power of all mankind is not as magnificent as Space X live. The cosmic vision fell back to the small North American studio that could not see the scale, destroying the cosmopolitan mind that the entire film had constructed.	original book might big average americans quote sheldon big bang theory indicment american education system original book tell story human be behave know truth universe mighty specis come adaptation dumbe popcorn small elite circle unite resist perhaps americans long understand something big honest therefore philosophical connotation three body problem dumbe popcorn american audience understand character know circle people world need obey elite small circle unite save planet classic american heroism elite view history abandon social fabric however compare portrayal savior elite film practice depict ordinary people background ant exacerbate narrative flaw series small circle elite powerful voice bring suffocate american style decision make black box case also assume human be unite complete part wall face task opposite reality plot completely meaningless final display eighth episode show power mankind magnificent space x live cosmic vision fall back small north american studio could see scale destroy cosmopolitan mind entire film construct
2	This series is great! Watching it made me want to play the Fallout games all over again, specially Fallout New Vegas, a favorite of mine. The scenery is beautiful, the main characters are interesting, most of the time, specially Lucy, the vault dweller. The script is engaging and it shows all the things that whoever likes the game, will also enjoy on the series. But the main reason I wanted to watch this series is because of Jonathan Nolan. Loved his other projects, such as Person of Interest and Westworld, and he is a good sci-fi series creator.Summarizing, this series is worth the watch and worthy of your time to check it out.	series great watch make want play fallout game specially fallout new vegas favorite mine scenery beautiful main character interest time specially lucy vault dweller script engage show thing whoever like game also enjoy series main reason want watch series jonathan nolan love project person interest westworld good sci fi series creator summarize series worth watch worthy time check
1	Overall I am happy with the adaption. All the key scenes are there, and well presented. The actors are doing a great job. The story is more or less well paced.There are weak moments and sometimes the story drags a bit, which is a pity, given that some of the important moments of the books that would be crucial for understanding are shortened or skipped. But for most of the time the plot is well reproduced and the story telling is spot on.However, merging the characters of the book into a group of five friends was unnecessary. It renders the story implausible (why should every important event happen to these five friends from college?) and the story telling shallow (some scenes and dialogs are down there on soap opera level).I give the show a solid 6/10.	overall happy adaption key scene well present actor great job story less well pace weak moment sometimes story drag bite pity give important moment book would crucial understand shorten skip time plot well reproduce story tell spot however merge character book group five friend unnecessary render story implausible every important event happen five friend college story tell shallow scene dialog soap opera level give show solid
2	First of all I would like to mention that I was skeptical when I first started watching this show simply because Hiroyuki Sanada has been casted as the japanese dude in any and all hollywood movies and shows. Is it really that difficult to find japanese talent? But after watching the first episode I was baffled by the quality of production of this show. Everything from Acting to set to costumes, everything was top notch and I was immersed in feudal japan. This show kind of reminded me of Shogun World from HBO TV series Westworld also featuring Hiroyuki Sanada as Main Japanese Guy, although he was a samurai in that one i believe.	first would like mention skeptical first start watch show simply hiroyuki sanada cast japanese dude hollywood movie show really difficult find japanese talent watch first episode baffle quality production show everything act set costume everything top notch immerse feudal japan show kind remind shogun world hbo tv series westworld also feature hiroyuki sanada main japanese guy although samurai one believe
1	"I'll make it clear that I haven't read the books, but I almost bought them to read before the series. Sci fi is my favorite genre of fiction, and the 3 Body Problem permeated my feed for a couple of years.Hence my disappointment: if you, like me, were hoping to watch the next television event after Game of Thrones, I'm sorry to say that this is not it.It's a shame that such a good story has been adapted into such a silly series.PLOT: From what I've been able to research after finishing the last episode, a lot has been ""adapted"" (completely changed) from the original source, and usually for the worse. Despite this, the plot itself is very interesting, although confusing and a little too crazy.In fact, these changes are what make the series such a bizarre narrative. The flashbacks in China are memorable, full of emotion and high drama, while everything that takes place in London is like a mixture of the most boring seasons of Westworld and some teen drama.CAST: The cast is a mess. Some good actors are badly cast, like Jonathan Pryce and Alex Sharp, while others shine, like Jess Hong as Jin Cheng and Zine Tseng as Ye Wenjie.The characters themselves are pretty bland, a group of geniuses who act like scumbag university students. Saul gets one of the coolest plot points in the series, but he's a loser, cynical pothead... Auggie (although well portrayed by Eiza Gonzalez) is completely one note, and John Bradley plays the most unpleasant guy in the world.At least Bradley didn't reprise his role as Sam Tarly from GoT, while Liam Cunningham continues to play Davos Seaworth, only in this universe he is more like Stannis Baratheon.DIRECTION/PRODUCTION/MUSIC I don't know what happened in these areas, but it's all pretty mediocre. The VR scenes are tedious and with PS1 CGI..., as well as a dull humor that kills any tension in the story; the soundtrack is like something recycled from Westworld (which isn't bad, but it's not great either); and the production itself is dreadful, with Galileo wearing modern glasses and a stylish tuft...Seriously, it looks like the series was developed by 2 completely different teams, because the flashback scenes are excellent; everyone is dirty, looks tired, etc. While the present-day scenes show soldiers working in the hot Panamanian sun, but their clothes are perfectly ironed and smooth.In short, the series is watchable, but that's about it. If you're saying (or hearing) it's the new Game of Thrones, or that it's the best sci-fi show of recent times, do yourself a favor and go watch The Expanse."	make clear read book almost buy read series sci fi favorite genre fiction body problem permeate fee couple year hence disappointment like hop watch next television event game throne sorry say shame good story adapt silly series plot able research finish last episode lot adapt completely change original source usually bad despite plot interest although confuse little crazy fact change make series bizarre narrative flashback china memorable full emotion high drama everything take place london like mixture bore season westworld teen drama cast cast mess good actor badly cast like jonathan pryce alex sharp other shine like jess hong jin cheng zine tseng ye wenjie character pretty bland group genius act like scumbag university student saul get one coolest plot point series loser cynical pothead auggie although well portray eiza gonzalez completely one note john bradley play unpleasant guy world least bradley reprise role sam tarly get liam cunningham continue play davos seaworth universe like stannis baratheon direction production music know happen area pretty mediocre vr scene tedious ps cgi well dull humor kill tension story soundtrack like something recycle westworld bad great either production dreadful galileo wear modern glass stylish tuft seriously look like series develop completely different team flashback scene excellent everyone dirty look tire etc present day scene show soldier work hot panamanian sun clothe perfectly iron smooth short series watchable say hear new game throne good sci fi show recent time favor go watch expanse
2	I was looking for something to watch casually. The premise seemed interesting and the ratings were unusually high for a limited series that I hadn't heard about yet. I had no idea what I was in for. I thought I was going into a bizarre stalker story, which in a sense it was, but it's full meaning goes much deeper and darker than I was expecting. A few things I saw coming, others took me by surprise. This is a story about the unhealthy ways one tends to deal with pain and trauma. I didn't expect such a gut-punch of a story. Made all the more intense because it actually happened. You don't necessarily have to experience what the people in this story experienced, to identify with them. This is a rare story that is quite powerful, very well told, and grabbed me by the throat at several times by the end. I don't rate things 9/10 very often, but this absolutely deserves it. It's not always an easy watch, but I fully recommend you see it.	look something watch casually premise seem interest rat unusually high limit series hear yet idea think go bizarre stalker story sense full mean go much deep darker expect thing see come other take surprise story unhealthy way one tend deal pain trauma expect gut punch story make intense actually happen necessarily experience people story experience identify rare story quite powerful well tell grab throat several time end rate thing often absolutely deserve always easy watch fully recommend see
1	"Two episodes in and I'm questioning is this TV show is going to get any better. I've watched Nathan Fillion and Melissa O'Neil in other TV shows and they're fun to watch, and at the moment it's the only reason why I'll invest any time watching The Rookie at all. The ""professional"" police officers who are training the rookies seem a bit detached. Maybe that's what they're going for? Also, if they're seasoned police officers, they don't seem very aware of what's going around them and their environment. This can either be put down as bad writing or directing because the actors have potential. The show is a bit bland regardless of all the action scenes. The Rookie is a bit disjointed and no flow to individual episodes as a whole. Is it a comedy, is it drama, it is both? I'm not getting much of either. I struggle to find any meaning or depth to this show. Having said all that, I don't mind watching The Rookie while I'm doing paperwork because I don't have to pay much attention because I'm really missing much."	two episode question tv show go get well watch nathan fillion melissa neil tv show fun watch moment reason invest time watch rookie professional police officer train rookie seem bite detach maybe go also season police officer seem aware go around environment either put bad write direct actor potential show bite bland regardless action scene rookie bite disjoint flow individual episode whole comedy drama get much either struggle find mean depth show say mind watch rookie paperwork pay much attention really miss much

2	"I remember seeing the trailer for this series a few months back and thought this is what I've been looking for; Japan in the late seventeenth century. The production is excellent and could easily be mistaken for a high budget film. The writing is sharp and even had quirk in it, fast paced and thought provoking. But what stood even beyond this is the characters. They actually feel real, imagine that in this time of famine, we have been starved of intelligent characters for so long, it felt refreshing to actually see writers put some effort into building these ""people"". Speaking of which, John Blackthorne the wild card British Pirate(Merchent - yeah right) that could upset the tides of war was a bold gamble on the writers behalf, but if they play there cards right, he might be the Ace that grants this series it's well deserved second season. If you haven't already, I would strongly recommend you start this series, you will not regret it."	remember see trailer series month back think look japan late seventeenth century production excellent could easily mistake high budget film write sharp even quirk fast pace think provoke stand even beyond character actually feel real imagine time famine starve intelligent character long feel refresh actually see writer put effort build people speak john blackthorne wild card british pirate merchent yeah right could upset tide war bold gamble writer behalf play card right might ace grant series well deserve second season already would strongly recommend start series regret
1	Sorry loved the show and the build up but wasn't it all a build up to show the famous battle was I the only one expecting to experience the great battle ,which if you read up on the actual battle would of been a great ending to the story a chess match no one expected with sides changing in the middle of the actual battle but just tell you a little bit of what would actually happen at the battle .Felt a little short changed at the end ,was like watching Napoleon and at the end they skip the battle ...On a plus side thought the acting was excellent but shame we didn't get to see the master plan actually unfold.	sorry love show build build show famous battle one expect experience great battle read actual battle would great end story chess match one expect side change middle actual battle tell little bite would actually happen battle feel little short change end like watch napoleon end skip battle plus side think act excellent shame get see master plan actually unfold
1	Kurosawa directed a masterpiece in 1957, Seven Samurai. This is something I've went back to many times, sadly I don't think Shogun warrants repeated plays.By no means is this a poor show, it certainly doesn't warrant some of the criticism, this is a good show; a good show not a great one.The casting is exceptional and the acting really very good, the story itself is also very good, the pace, atmosphere, cinematography all really very good.I think the thing for me that knocks this from a solid 9 to a 7, is the character played by Cosmo Jarvis.It's like he's sat down and watched the excellent TV series, Taboo, and tried to emulate some of the characteristics that Tom Hardy displayed playing the character James Delaney.I'm sure had I not seen Taboo, this may have went completely over my head, however I have and this just seems like a less convincing version of a character.That said, it is a good show and I'm sure I'll be there if and when they do a second series.	kurosawa direct masterpiece seven samurai something go back many time sadly think shogun warrant repeat play mean poor show certainly warrant criticism good show good show great one cast exceptional act really good story also good pace atmosphere cinematography really good think thing knock solid character play cosmo jarvis like sit watch excellent tv series taboo try emulate characteristic tom hardy display play character jam delaney sure see taboo may go completely head however seem like less convince version character say good show sure second series
0	"So, this started like most HBO crap: lots of blood, ""in your face"" nudity to remind you why you pay the extra instead of settling for the basic cable package, and sex more sleazy than the average Hustler vid.Except that the women of Thrones aren't ""amazing"". They look like what the porn industry throws on the ""amateur"" flicks. And thats WITH the make-up. The sex was boring; there's more chemistry in a math class than on these sets. And the fighting and blood were clearly done by someone that hasn't seen combat or held any of those weapons or armor. Oh, and the gay pandering is so blatant, Im surprised it isn't being boycotted. Im serious, until season 5 they cant do an episode without grinding your face in gay sex. It seems like the few rare scenes that Don't involve homosexual sex in some way are the incest scenes. I've heard of ""blaxploitation"" as a category, but what do we call this? ""gaysploitation""? ""homosploitation""? Should it be more insultive, as the ""blax"" is, to show contempt for the disrespect it does to the minority pandered to?I guess the ""kill a named character every two episodes"" mantra actually comes from the books, which is all the more reason not to read the books, to me. If I want some pompous jackwagon that spends 2 pages introducing me to the character just to immediately kill off said character, I'll go back to Victorian authors like dickens, who were paid by the letter, rather than for content. We're in season 5, and the only character left from the beginning that you might care about is Ari. The screen-writers have gotten so desperate Cersi is naked. I realize there's an audience for middle-aged women with buzz-cuts getting pelted with garbage and sewage, I just figured it was mostly centralized in German fetishism, not HBO ""mainstream"" audience. Or maybe the two are really one and the same?The only central plots across the seasons are ""winter is coming"", because apparently in this world that doesn't happen every year? IDK, they never address why its so important that seasons, ya know, change and stuff... Oh, and the other is, ""if you do good, your gonna get screwed"". Every character that tries to ""do the right thing"", or act good, whether in character or not, pays for it. And in GoT, there's only one way you pay: death. Often with a little creepy-border-line rapey-time as well, especially in the later seasons.Do yourself a favor. If you want to watch porn, watch porn. If you want to watch TV, watch TV.

0	It started off well, the story grabbed my interest, helped along by the beautiful cinematography. After that though it started to lose me and by episode three I was wondering if I was really watching a goofy and very weak black comedy with a protagonist who is incredibly incompetent and barely capable of tying his own shoelaces.I've not read the original book, I've not even seen the movie starring Matt Damon, but I'm now tempted to at least watch the movie because it has good word of mouth.But back to this series ....... not only does it play out like a weak black comedy but the script and the acting has a stilted quality that reminds me of bad theatrical plays.The acting is nothing special - not bad, but not great either.In short, I'm extremely disappointed.	start well story grab interest help along beautiful cinematography though start lose episode three wonder really watch goofy weak black comedy protagonist incredibly incompetent barely capable tie shoelace read original book even see movie star matt damon tempt least watch movie good word mouth back series play like weak black comedy script act stilte quality remind bad theatrical play act nothing special bad great either short extremely disappoint
1	She is not a good actress. Her emotionless face makes it impossible to connect. Looking at a fixed point without reacting is not acting. She spends the whole series with a look of surprise and fear, but it's just an attempt because she doesn't succeed. I'm sorry, but with such a big budget they could have hired someone who could act. The rest of the casting is fine. Especially the Chinese. In general there is a greater repertoire of emotions. I mean, they know how to act.On the other hand, the story is good. The creators make the impossible, possible. But they made a mistake with the protagonist.	good actress emotionless face make impossible connect look fix point without react act spend whole series look surprise fear attempt succeed sorry big budget could hire someone could act rest cast fine especially chinese general great repertoire emotion mean know act hand story good creator make impossible possible make mistake protagonist
2	Season 1: Fallout has a particular flavor when it comes to post apocalyptic tales. Luckily, the show captured it perfectly. The aesthetic was perfect. I felt like I was in the fallout world. You could tell from the junk in the background and the uniforms and the way the armor looked. Whoever did the set design did their homeworkThe tale of these three characters are great. The characters are very still developed and have great character arcs.This does a lot of fan service to the people who played the games. If you like sci-fi, post apocalyptic things and/or wacky dark humor you might like this, but if you're more of a casual show watcher, this might not be for you.But there wasn't a lot to complain about. The ending was okay, but kinda meh. The journey was great but the way it was tied up was not great imo.I didn't like the liberties they took with some aspects of the lore but I understand this is an adaptation, not a copy of the video games on a different medium.All in all, I enjoyed the ride. I can't wait for season two.	season fallout particular flavor come post apocalyptic tale luckily show capture perfectly aesthetic perfect feel like fallout world could tell junk background uniform way armor look whoever set design homeworkthe tale three character great character still develop great character arc lot fan service people play game like sci fi post apocalyptic thing wacky dark humor might like casual show watcher might lot complain end okay kinda meh journey great way tie great imo like liberty take aspect lore understand adaptation copy video game different medium enjoy ride wait season two
1	"There are A LOT of things to like in the series. But these last 2 episodes (season 8) were a downer for me. In episode 2, I understand the quiet before the storm, but the pace was so slow, and the acting was so flat I had a foreboding omen. Episode 3 had better be a killer!It wasn't.Who exactly advised you on strategy? You guys had a CASTLE to defend (from the inside. Behind tall structures called walls). Maybe you thought that PARKING your entire army OUTSIDE the walls in PARADE stance against absolute darkness was strategy? Maybe you thought that throwing basically your entire cavalry in one suicide attack IN THE DARK was a good idea?That is the most RIDICULOUS way of throwing your forces into the fire!Have you ever heard of ""The last charge of the Light Brigade""?Such a disappointment."	lot thing like series last episode season downer episode understand quiet storm pace slow act flat forebode oman episode well killer exactly advise strategy guy castle defend inside behind tall structure call wall maybe think park entire army outside wall parade stance absolute darkness strategy maybe think throw basically entire cavalry one suicide attack dark good idea ridiculous way throw force fire ever hear last charge light brigade disappointment
0	I liked it until Season 6. Then I kept watching it -just because- until Season 11. I recently checked back and I couldn't watch a single episode without flinching. To me, it went from a 7-star series, to a 3-star, then to a negative-1-star (negative, because the producers are still extracting profits out of a very low-quality show). The weighted average is now 1 star!Every marriage fails. Every pregnancy becomes a high-risk one. Every season finale involves some big crash/disaster. Majority of the characters have been on the operating table, survived a major surgery, and never experienced a single complication during (a super speedy) recovery. And we are supposed to believe that highly intelligent characters, world-class doctors, base their arguments on emotions and irrational explanations. The drama heavily relies on situations that are highly implausible. Are the writers not able to actually produce quality writing?	like season keep watch season recently check back watch single episode without flinch go star series star negative star negative producer still extract profit low quality show weight average star every marriage fail every pregnancy become high risk one every season finale involve big crash disaster majority character operate table survive major surgery never experience single complication super speedy recovery suppose believe highly intelligent character world class doctor base argument emotion irrational explanation drama heavily rely situation highly implausible writer able actually produce quality write

0	"Spoilers ahead!!Watched all 8 episodes. Disappointed!I haven't read the books, but I couldn't believe it had such enormous hype. I hope this isn't a true adaptation.For a story revolving around physicists, this makes a mockery of the entire scientific community. Fate of humanity rests on the hands of a bunch of post-docs from a single dept of one university all working under the same professor? Yeah why not! Let's not forget one of them is a potato chips salesman.Where are the astrobiologists? Nuclear physicists? Experimentalists? Astroliguists? Engineers? Don't ask!Atleast they could have developed these characters better to make us believe in them. For instance, they could have been PhDs or postdocs whose careers have taken them into different paths. They're all in their 40s or 50s, now they are the who's who in their respective fields, with many scientists and engineers working under them. And they meet after many years at the funeral of their professor. Atleast that would have been believable.There's no background information about their scientific contributions. We are just told ""they're from Oxford, they're young, and working in (insert some science-y sounding words) and so they're the best"". That's it!There is no teamwork. Everyone is a specialist in something. Occasionally one of them goes to the other and says ""can you do this for me?"", and the other person does it all alone in a computer, like a bunch of fairies waving magic wands. I'm sorry creators of the show, that's not how science and engineering works.Atleast I could have forgiven the creators if only they introduced these characters any better than how they did. The way they introduce the two ladies in that bar scene, just instantly lowered my expectations for the show. I went in expecting a GoT level show.. Gosh was I so disappointed.. If you're a budding screenwriter reading this review, please remember this: scientists would never talk about themselves in such a bombastic way, especially if they're so early in their careers, and that too to a stranger who's clearly not a scientist himself. Watch Oppenheimer, Arrival, Interstellar, Contact to know how real scientists talk. If that's how you introduce your main characters, it's just an instant turn off. How can we root for a person like that?There are so many loopholes in the story. Like, why just China figured out how to talk to aliens? Nasa here sending people to the moon and robots to mars and probes to Pluto but couldn't figure out how to send a signal to the sun? And why only this Wong guy and his boss investigate the murders of these scientists? Clearly they're dying everywhere, not just in the UK. A senior scientist in India died by suicide? Yeah let's wait for the never-heard-before detective working for a shady UK govt organization to arrive at the crime scene.If the aliens are so powerful that they listen to every single conversation happening at every location in the world, and they could cover the entire planet with a weapon the size of a proton, how come they're so dumb as to not find another habitable planet somewhere nearby to their star? With such technology, you don't even need a habitable planet. You can just simply terraform any planet.And what's with that stupid VR game thing? It's such an elaborate subplot just to reveal the evil plan of the bad guys. I thought bond villains are the worst!Why slice through an entire ship like a vegetable chopper slicing an onion, just to recover a hard drive? Imagine you're the head of MI6, and you ask your subordinates to come up with a plan for a covert operation to retrieve a hard drive from a cruise ship, and this is the plan your subordinates come up with. This is like letting Peter Griffin device a plan for capturing Bin laden. Just makes no sense at all!And why choose a high school teacher's brain as your choice for communicating with the aliens? What about the thousands of octogenarians and septuagenarians who spent their entire lives trying to talk to aliens? Surely at least one of them must be in their death beds, and would definitely jump at such an opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, it's like Stranger things met interstellar.But I just sincerely hope that some of these plot holes are eventually addressed in future seasons. I haven't read the books, so I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt at the moment. If not, even a 3/10 would become too generous of me.This once again reinforces the belief that Benioff and Weiss are nothing without the genius of GRRM. The moment they start putting their own brains into their creations, their true creativity is visible for everyone to see."	spoiler ahead watch episode disappoint read book believe enormous hype hope true adaptation story revolve around physicist make mockery entire scientific community fate humanity rest hand bunch post doc single dept one university work professor yeah let forget one potato chip salesman astrobiologist nuclear physicist experimentalist astroliguist engineer ask atleast could develop character well make we believe instance could phds postdocs whose career take different path respective field many scientist engineer work meet many year funeral professor atleast would believable background information scientific contribution tell oxford young work insert science sound word good teamwork everyone specialist something occasionally one go say person alone computer like bunch fairy wave magic wand sorry creator show science engineer work atleast could forgive creator introduce character well way introduce two lady bar scene instantly low expectation show go expect get level show gosh disappoint bud screenwrit read review please remember scientist would never talk bombastic way especially early career stranger clearly scientist watch oppenheimer arrival interstellar contact know real scientist talk introduce main character instant turn root person like many loophole story like china figure talk alien nasa send people moon robot mar probe pluto figure send signal sun wong guy boss investigate murder scientist clearly die everywhere uk senior scientist india die suicide yeah let wait never hear detective work shady uk govt organization arrive crime scene alien powerful listen every single conversation happen every location world could cover entire planet weapon size proton come dumb find another habitable planet somewhere nearby star technology even need habitable planet simply terraform planet stupid vr game thing elaborate subplot reveal evil plan bad guy think bond villain bad slice entire ship like vegetable chopper slice onion recover hard drive imagine head mi ask subordinate come plan covert operation retrieve hard drive cruise ship plan subordinate come like let peter griffin device plan capture bin lade make sense choose high school teacher brain choice communicate alien thousand octogenarians septuagenarian spend entire live try talk alien surely least one must death bed would definitely jump opportunity mention early like strange thing meet interstellar sincerely hope plot hole eventually address future season read book would like give benefit doubt moment even would become generous reinforce belief benioff weiss nothing without genius grrm moment start put brain creation true creativity visible everyone see
0	"*** This review may contain spoilers ****Plot and ending analyzed*It seems that the producers hired the most annoying, uncouth, asinine, and boorish Englishman that they could find. Where did they find this guy? At the taverns? At the docks? All he does is curse and curse. In reality, no Japanese feudal lord would put up with his outbursts. This bloke is so bloody over the top ridiculous and insane that it really ruined the fine acting from the Japanese actors. His acting is so wooden, and he doesn't inspire any sympathy at all. He is a loudmouth braggart. If you are a stranger in a strange land, it probably would prolong your life to keep quiet and assess the situation. But this guy, he is a bombastic vulgarian. Why the Portuguese rogues or few Spaniards did not toss him into the tides is beyond me.Another major problem was that one of the writers was a woman, and it looks like they let her inject some modern day extreme feminism in many of the action scenes. There's a household maid that starts killing everyone with a knife and they made it look like she was unstoppable. The attack in the forest scene had the Japanese woman translator pick up a spear and hack about five Japanese soldiers with ease. It was absolutely stupid. That completely ruined the decent dramatic scenes. I am sure that she will be fighting samurai in the later episodes. And what did the Englishman do during the attack, did he pick up a sword himself? Nope.And the English steersman is supposedly speaking Portuguese while we are hearing English? Okay. While he does not know a word of that language? The script continuity supervisor completely failed the audience.Not to mention that the writers are vehemently anti-Catholic and despise the Portuguese and Spaniards while favoring the Dutch and English.And the idiotic scene with the boats and ships? Utterly unrealistic. Preposterous. This is the type of dumb things that we are forced to sit through, cartoon fantasy scenes.The English steersman was supposedly starving and had scurvy on the long trip to Japan, but when he took off his clothing to swim, it appeared that he had been at the gymnasium recently.And as usual, they made the Japanese translator very beautiful. She can not be fat or ugly. How is that for the double standard? On the one hand, women can fight exactly like men, but then they have to look beautiful. Hypocrisy.Episode four was just dreadful. Apparently, the English steersman, who said he knew nothing of military tactics and expertise in the previous episode, is an artillery genius in this episode. And he trains a few Japanese soldiers, making them experts as well. Seventeenth century artillery guns were unwieldy and difficult to shoot accurately. In a highly preposterous scene, the new Japanese artillery men make waste of some enemy horsemen from 1000 yards out. And the general, whose limbs are all bloody and absent, mutters that it was not honorable behavior. All that because some impetuous young son wanted attention.The English steersman, who in previous episodes is made out to be a devout Protestant, sleeps with a Japanese prostitute, and he is married. More hypocrisy. And there is more foreshadowing that the Japanese translator may be a key to the future. I personally think that she may be a trained assassin who has a shady past, and will kill the enemy lord. If that is the case, this whole series is a complete farce. The episodes are getting progressively worse and worse.Episode five is more of the same haggard storytelling, which in this case, amounts to more of the same nonsense from all the previous episodes. There is some uninteresting balderdash about a dead chicken pheasant that is ""not supposed to be touched"". The Englishman was jokingly saying that anyone who touched it would be killed. Turns out, the gardener touched it and was put to death, and the Englishman is wondering why. His empty-headed buffoonery is getting tedious.Then the husband of the Japanese translator has ""miraculously"" returned alive. Apparently, he and ten unemployed samurai fought off those hundred soldiers. Okay. Whatever. Well, the writers put him through the sewer in this episode. They made him more unlikeable than Genghis Khan. He can not hold his Japanese liquor against the Englishman, but he still is an expert marksman with a bow and arrow.They also put out the expected female victim card for the Japanese translator, so that the audience can weep and instantly side with her. Except it was done in a horrible manner, so to an educated viewer, it looks entirely contrived.More contrivance is included later when the lazy writers throw in an unexpected earthquake. The laughable scene is so utterly inane that you have to see it to believe it. I'm sure they will also include a tsunami in the following episodes.I don't think that the series will improve much. But I'll still watch it to the end. Like a man on a sinking ship.Hopefully a few good things will come from this pathetic and pitiable series. Japanese mom and pops restaurants will have some business, people will buy some Japanese history and art books, and that they will also look to the past for the excellent Japanese film directors, who include Akira Kurosawa.Stick with the original version and the book itself. This version is useless and horrendous. A complete waste of time."	review may contain spoiler plot end analyze seem producer hire annoy uncouth asinine boorish englishman could find find guy tavern dock curse curse reality japanese feudal lord would put outburst bloke bloody top ridiculous insane really ruin fine act japanese actor act wooden inspire sympathy loudmouth braggart strange strange land probably would prolong life keep quiet assess situation guy bombastic vulgarian portuguese rogue spaniard toss tide beyond another major problem one writer woman look like let inject modern day extreme feminism many action scene household maid start kill everyone knife make look like unstoppable attack forest scene japanese woman translator pick spear hack five japanese soldier ease absolutely stupid completely ruin decent dramatic scene sure fight samurai later episode englishman attack pick sword nope english steersman supposedly speak portuguese hear english okay know word language script continuity supervisor completely fail audience mention writer vehemently anti catholic despise portuguese spaniard favor dutch english idiotic scene boat ship utterly unrealistic preposterous type dumb thing force sit cartoon fantasy scene english steersman supposedly starve scurvy long trip japan take clothe swim appear gymnasium recently usual make japanese translator beautiful fat ugly double standard one hand woman fight exactly like man look beautiful hypocrisy episode four dreadful apparently english steersman say know nothing military tactic expertise previous episode artillery genius episode train japanese soldier make expert well seventeenth century artillery gun unwieldy difficult shoot accurately highly preposterous scene new japanese artillery man make waste enemy horsemen yard general whose limb bloody absent mutter honorable behavior impetuous young son want attention english steersman previous episode make devout protestant sleep japanese prostitute marry hypocrisy foreshadow japanese translator may key future personally think may train assassin shady past kill enemy lord case whole series complete farce episode get progressively worse bad episode five haggard storytelle case amount nonsense previous episode unintereste balderdash dead chicken pheasant suppose touch englishman jokingly say anyone touch would kill turn gardener touch put death englishman wonder empty head buffoonery get tedious husband japanese translator miraculously return alive apparently ten unemployed samurai fight hundred soldier okay whatever well writer put sewer episode make unlikeable genghis khan hold japanese liquor englishman still expert marksman bow arrow also put expect female victim card japanese translator audience weep instantly side except do horrible manner educate viewer look entirely contrive contrivance include later lazy writer throw unexpected earthquake laughable scene utterly inane see believe sure also include tsunami follow episode think series improve much still watch end like man sink ship hopefully good thing come pathetic pitiable series japanese mom pop restaurant business people buy japanese history art book also look past excellent japanese film director include akira kurosawa stick original version book version useless horrendous complete waste time

And yet the chief character refuses to punish them in any way.And the list goes on and on. There's not a single good thing about this show and I have no idea how it has such good ratings.

2	"As Episode 1 of ""Ripley"" (2024 release; 8 episodes ranging from 44 to 76 min) opens, it is ""Rome, 1961"" and we see Ripley dragging a dead body down the stairs. We then go to ""Six Months Earlier"", with Ripley living in New York and barely getting by. Then one day he gets contacted by a shipbuilder on Long Island, whose son has disappeared somewhere in Italy, and would Ripley want to find him and convince him to return to New York... At this point we are 10 minutes of Episode 1.Couple of comments: this is written, produces and directed by Steve Zaillian, whose script for Schindler's List won an Oscar. Here Zaiilian revisits Patricia Highsmith's books on the conman that was Tom Ripley. Like many of you, I watched the 1999 movie starring Matt Damon, and quite liked it. But let me state right away that there is zero doubt in my mind that this 2024 mini-series is superior to the 1999 movie. For one, the script for this mini-series is very strong. It may bother some people that this is slow-paced. I for one am very grateful for that, as we get to see the characters fully develop before our eyes. It also apparently bothers some that the mini-series in shot entirely in B&W. I happen to think this works very well, considering the setting (early 60s). (As an aside, Zaillian has stated that the cover of a Ripley book he read had a B&W photo which inspired him to shoot the series in B&W.) Last and certainly not least, the production sets are exquisite (look at all of the details). And quite helpful is the very strong cast, including Andrew Scott as Ripley, Johnny Flynn as Dickie, and an unrecognizable Dakota Fanning as Marge.""Ripley"" started streaming on Netflix last weekend, and I watched it spread over 3 evenings. The mini-series is currently rated 85% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and that sounds about right to me. If you have any interest in the Ripley character or are simply in the mood for an engaging mini-series about a conman, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion."	episode ripley release episode range min open rome see ripley drag dead body stair go six month early ripley live new york barely get one day get contact shipbuilder long island whose son disappear somewhere italy would ripley want find convince return new york point minute episode couple comment write produce direct steve zaillian whose script schindler list oscar zaiilian revisit patricia highsmith book conman tom ripley like many watch movie star matt damon quite like let state right away zero doubt mind mini series superior movie one script mini series strong may bother people slow pace one grateful get see character fully develop eye also apparently bother mini series shoot entirely b w happen think work well consider set early aside zaillian state cover ripley book read b w photo inspire shoot series b w last certainly least production set exquisite look detail quite helpful strong cast include andrew scott ripley johnny flynn dickie unrecognizable dakota fan marge ripley start stream netflix last weekend watch spread even mini series currently rat certify fresh rotten tomato sound right interest ripley character simply mood engage mini series conman readily suggest check draw conclusion

0	Loved season 1 and 2, but I find the writing of Season 3 to be very bad. The writers seem more interested in pandering towards certain political agendas than creating interesting storylines and good TV.I like Nathan Fillion as an actor, and I think also many of the other cast-members are good, however the material that was given to Brandon Routh for instance was so ham-handed and shallow the end result will be cringeworthy nevertheless.	love season find write season bad writer seem interest pander towards certain political agenda create interest storyline good tv like nathan fillion actor think also many cast member good however material give brandon routh instance ham hand shallow end result cringeworthy nevertheless
1	This is a sci-fi series from the creator of Game of Thrones that adapts a Hugo award-winning Chinese novel, but with almost all the characters changed to Westerners. It keeps only the major plot events and the Chinese female lead character from the beginning. While this aspect is done well, it completely loses the deeper Chinese political science content of the original. And viewers of the series cannot then go read the original novel. Additionally, the newly created characters become a group of drunken scientists full of Western-style personal life and romantic issues, which is an unnecessary aspect that the show labors on throughout. This greatly reduces the value of the original work. (The previous Chinese TV series version on WeTV was much more faithful to the original novel.)	sci fi series creator game throne adapt hugo award win chinese novel almost character change westerner keep major plot event chinese female lead character begin aspect do well completely lose deep chinese political science content original viewer series go read original novel additionally newly create character become group drunken scientist full western style personal life romantic issue unnecessary aspect show labor throughout greatly reduce value original work previous chinese tv series version wetv much faithful original novel

To the point of obsession, she begins stalking him. How does Donny cope, he feels sorry for her that's how. The back story is more powerful, at first Martha is a figure of fun for Donny colleagues in the bar where he works. We slowly watch Donny' life rise and fall, parallel to the mutual obsession, that is slowly building between the two main protagonist. Fuelled by social media, and the reliance of mobile phones, this goes into some dark places. Donny finds the only person he can truly relate to and trust is his stalker Martha. She understands Donny and his demons.This is a great story and will be talked about by all who see it. 9/10.	baby reindeer netflix episode vary length hour worth wow powerful stuff wan na comedian donny dunn befriend lose soul martha become besotte point obsession begin stalk donny cope feel sorry back story powerful first martha figure fun donny colleague bar work slowly watch donny life rise fall parallel mutual obsession slowly build two main protagonist fuel social medium reliance mobile phone go dark place donny find person truly relate trust stalker martha understand donny demon great story talk see
0	I couldn't get past how unlikeable the protagonist is.***Spoilers***The synopsis implies that he's targeted by a stalker, but in reality, he's the one who initiates the stalking and creates all of his own problems for himself. He's a liar, a loser, and generally someone that is impossible to root for. I'm all for flawed protagonists, but this guy - despite having a superficial gentleness about him - is really just a creepy dude with a victim complex who lies to women, stalks them, leads them on, and then makes a surprise Pikachu face when his life is not so good as a result of his own bad decisions. The stalker lady was honestly more sympathetic in comparison, believe it or not.Wish I had positive things to say.	get past unlikeable protagonist spoiler synopsis imply target stalker reality one initiate stalk create problem liar loser generally someone impossible root flaw protagonist guy despite superficial gentleness really creepy dude victim complex lie woman stalk lead make surprise pikachu face life good result bad decision stalker lady honestly sympathetic comparison believe wish positive thing say

1	Interesting police drama, Nathan does his best to portray a middle aged man starting a second career as a cop. The biggest problem is, the cops in the show don't follow correct procedures, and it's easily apparent that the show is designed to entertain the adolescent minds that think comic books make great movies. Lots of violent interactions, i.e., the gang that couldn't shoot straight seems to be the criminals in every shoot 'em up episode. As in, the whole mob of gunmen who can't hit a single cop, despite them all having submachine guns. And no one gets hit by a single bullet? Really? But than you have cops doing things just as ignorant, ignoring procedure and then getting hurt because of it. Is this supposed to make criminals think this is how real law enforcement works? Gee, I hope so.As is common, what we see here is mostly stupid people doing stupid things. If that is what you are looking for, well then this show is for you. Our 5th and 6th grade kids and their friends love it. The adults, not so much; and it's not the violence that's upsetting, it's the incredible ignorance and foolishness of the supposedly adult, educated officers in the show.	interest police drama nathan good portray middle age man start second career cop big problem cop show follow correct procedure easily apparent show design entertain adolescent mind think comic book make great movie lot violent interaction e gang shoot straight seem criminal every shoot em episode whole mob gunman hit single cop despite submachine gun one get hit single bullet really cop thing ignorant ignore procedure get hurt suppose make criminal think real law enforcement work gee hope common see mostly stupid people stupid thing look well show th th grade kid friend love adult much violence upset incredible ignorance foolishness supposedly adult educate officer show
1	I think japanese historians are reviewing this show, its good in places, like an epic film I suppose, but in other places there is just way too much talking between mundane characters, i had to skip it, it was just so BORING. It honestly seems like a history show sometimes, maybe it will pick up and get better, the trailer is impressive, but getting through some of the first 2 episodes is.....painful in places, why do I have to write so much, some times i see reviews that are 100 characters long, how is that happening? I wish this was like that, oh Anna Sawai looks beautiful in the show, better than in godzilla.

1	"Positives: The show is well made. Production value is great. I personally like a slow tempo, setting things up and unravelling the mystery bit by bit. Some cast choices I really liked.The bad stuff: Some of the characters fall flat, and painfully so. Just not working for me, and I can sense their ""on camera vibe"", so I guess it's not working for them either. Not sure if it's casting, directing, script or the source material.I just finished episode 5 and it brings up bad memories. I only read the 3rd book of the series, after picking it up at a train station for a longer journey. Some aspects were really good, some were just awful. Especially the one-dimensional characterisation of women.Episode 5 and the ""Ship Scene"" really reminded me of how nonsensical the plot can be, based on the many shortcomings of the source material.So... this is the ONLY way to solve the issue? Watch it and you know what I mean.What I hated about the book the most: The romantic partner of the main character was such a hollow, lifeless side-note, only there to deliver prompts so the author could clean up a completely pointless emotional growth journey for the man.The metaphorical fig leaf over the not-so-metaphorical plot holes.Overall: watchable if you're bored. Infuriating, if you forget to switch off your brain."	positive show well make production value great personally like slow tempo set thing unravel mystery bite bite cast choice really like bad stuff character fall flat painfully work sense camera vibe guess work either sure cast direct script source material finish episode bring bad memory read rd book series pick train station long journey aspect really good awful especially one dimensional characterisation woman episode ship scene really remind nonsensical plot base many shortcoming source material way solve issue watch know mean hat book romantic partner main character hollow lifeless side note deliver prompt author could clean completely pointless emotional growth journey man metaphorical fig leaf metaphorical plot hole overall watchable bore infuriate forget switch brain

0	Started out pretty good, but gets worse and worse each season. Becomes just another sex and liberal-issues obsessed show. Near every episode has people basically jumping into the closest closet or empty room to get it on - while at work in the hospital. In later seasons, they really push the lesbian relationships hard - over and over. If you binge watch, all the sex-at- work and alternative-lifestyles-presented-as-normal-and-widespread get much harder to overlook. And then on top of that, all the hardcore liberal political stories that start to get shoved in with zero subtlety or fairness. Another show where the creators take their initial success as an opportunity to cram their viewpoints and twisted morality down your throat instead of just keeping on with what they were doing good at. I'd say it started out as an 8, but last few have dropped to a 4 at best.	start pretty good get worse bad season become another sex liberal issue obsess show near every episode people basically jump close closet empty room get work hospital later season really push lesbian relationship hard binge watch sex work alternative lifestyle present normal widespread get much hard overlook top hardcore liberal political story start get shove zero subtlety fairness another show creator take initial success opportunity cram viewpoint twist morality throat instead keep good say start last drop well
1	This show had some really interesting ideas and concepts. It could've gone really far. But each episode just keeps introduces the beginning of a sentence, without finishing it. It's never finished. Not even in the last episode. Which was epically disappointing, introduced even more questions with absolutely no answers, follow up, or solution. I hate when shows do this. I don't even know if there's a second season...if there's more seasons then this is just ok. Still incredibly unsatisfying. If there's no more seasons, then wtf even was this? Epically pointless.Lots of potential, lots of interesting thoughts, but in the end you're left empty.	show really interest idea concept could go really far episode keep introduce begin sentence without finish never finish even last episode epically disappoint introduce even question absolutely answer follow solution hate show even know second season season ok still incredibly unsatisfying season wtf even epically pointless lot potential lot interest thought end leave empty
1	"I didn't plan to check out ""Sugar,"" a neo-noir TV series about a private detective, which didn't sound interesting at all.There were many red flags suggesting it would be subpar, including the name ""Sugar,"" which follows the cliché of having a name that also has another meaning, like ""Monk,"" ""Magnum,"" or ""Castle,"" among others.It started in black and white, which, in my opinion, should only be used for flashbacks and is narrated in the first person.Nonetheless, I gave it a chance, and it somehow started growing on me.This production definitely tries to incorporate every trick and cliché in the book. The private eye is sick, dislikes guns, drives a vintage car, dresses the same every day, and only searches for missing persons. There are even meta jokes, including the hero entering a bar named 007.At the same time, it tries to be different with some unusual cinematography angles, like those from a TikTok video shot with Insta360 cameras. Despite the scant information provided about his background, past, and personality, the main character is almost paper-thin, yet you find yourself starting to like him and wanting to follow his story.This is an advantageous role for Colin Farrell, but he owns it well. Amy Ryan also delivers a strong performance as a lonely alcoholic.Overall, I will keep watching, even though I hadn't planned to. It's a 'construct,' not a solid series-too many clichés thrown together, but somehow, I didn't change the channel."	plan check sugar neo noir tv series private detective sound interest many red flag suggest would subpar include name sugar follow clich name also another mean like monk magnum castle among other start black white opinion use flashback narrate first person nonetheless give chance somehow start grow production definitely try incorporate every trick clich book private eye sick dislike gun drive vintage car dress every day search miss person even meta joke include hero enter bar name time try different unusual cinematography angle like tiktok video shoot insta camera despite scant information provide background past personality main character almost paper thin yet find start like want follow story advantageous role colin farrell own well amy ryan also deliver strong performance lonely alcoholic overall keep watch even though plan construct solid series many clich throw together somehow change channel

2	"Once again, Netflix goes out on a limb to reach beyond the predictable feelgood fair so many want - and possibly need - in dawn of dystopian age we find ourselves living in. Baby Reindeer is tagged as a dark comedy, and there are certainly comic aspects to it, but it is steeped - almost mired - in tragedy that already I'm hearing as misunderstood by viewers dismissing it as ""unfunny."" describing the tragic protagonist as ""self absorbed"" and ""lazy."" I found Donny neither of these, but rather twisted with self-hatred and crippled by indecisiveness. We sense his desire to be wanted and loved, fully aware aware that in his eyes he is unworthy of either.As Donny, Richard Gadd's Donny gives among of the most harrowing, frustrating and ultimately heartbreaking performances I've seen this year. Lanky and raw, his eyes, mouth and jaw move constantly from a place of fear that is set across his scraggly bearded, hollow face, both handsome and homely. Every thought, every emotion plays across his mask in direct opposition of the poker face he imagines hides the true Donny.The pathetic journey of this failing and flailing comic becomes painful to witness - almost unbearable at times, but that is the point isn't it? To show what real suffering is, to reveal that complete inability to move forward because one is held back by fear and hatred. This level of self-loathing is addictive and isn't meant to be pretty or funny. It isn't. It cannot be. It's made manifest through the jokes that die before they're emitted from his lips, from the juvenile props that fail to offer any comic relief from the torment. And yet, he goes on, confusing the familiar humiliation of his life as a kind of comfort.I grew frustrated to the point of anger with Donny, thinking ""there are easy fixes, mate . . . Just buck up, be honest be . . ."" before realizing how many years I spent telling myself those same things. How frequently my looking in the mirror, telling myself ""it's an easy fix, mate,"" when the reality was not only wasn't it not easy, there are times where there seemed to be no fix at all. Ever. Gadd captures this paralyzing inability with such poignancy I more than once found myself unable to hold back tears. At long last comes the moment of self-confrontation one sensed had to happen to make this all work. Without knowing Mr. Gadd, all I can say is, he brings us to that place where actor and character fuse into a oneness, something so beautifully raw, so abraded that can only be seen as a revelation, a catharsis. Yes, it's acting, masterful even, but it feels is more than that as well. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't want to know.On the opposite side of that same coin is the chilling, harrowingly raw portrayal of Martha by Jessica Gunning. It is incredibly easy to dislike a creature such as Martha . . . Manipulative, foul, deceitful, and wonder why Donny allows himself to be torturously abused by her at every turn. But we know why don't we? First and foremost, he pities her but it's more than that. He, unwittingly at first recognizes that, beneath the surface, Martha is the same emotional ticking time bomb as he. Gunning brilliantly uses her face to convey elation, naughtiness, rage, pain and emotional blankness with an ease of facility equal to Gadd's Donny. Indeed, the two make an uncomfortably powerful match in Baby Reindeer.Time prevents me from going on, but I must at least in passing say that , Nava Mau, Nina Sosanya, Tom Goodman-Hill, Shalom Brune-Franklin, all give sensational performances in supporting roles that contribute to and flesh out this dark, powerful story.One of Netflix best in several years.."	netflix go limb reach beyond predictable feelgood fair many want possibly need dawn dystopian age find live baby reindeer tag dark comedy certainly comic aspect steep almost mire tragedy already hear misunderstand viewer dismiss unfunny describe tragic protagonist self absorb lazy find donny neither rather twist self hatred cripple indecisiveness sense desire want love fully aware aware eye unworthy either donny richard gadd donny give among harrow frustrate ultimately heartbreake performance see year lanky raw eye mouth jaw move constantly place fear set across scraggly beard hollow face handsome homely every think every emotion play across mask direct opposition poker face imagine hide true donny pathetic journey fail flail comic become painful witness almost unbearable time point show real suffer reveal complete inability move forward one hold back fear hatred level self loathe addictive mean pretty funny make manifest joke die emit lip juvenile prop fail offer comic relief torment yet go confuse familiar humiliation life kind comfort grow frustrate point anger donny think easy fix mate buck honest realize many year spend tell thing frequently look mirror tell easy fix mate reality easy time seem fix ever gadd capture paralyze inability poignancy find unable hold back tear long last come moment self confrontation one sense happen make work without know mr gadd say bring we place actor character fuse oneness something beautifully raw abrade see revelation catharsis yes act masterful even feel well maybe wrong want know opposite side coin chill harrowingly raw portrayal martha jessica gun incredibly easy dislike creature martha manipulative foul deceitful wonder donny allow torturously abuse every turn know first foremost pity unwittingly first recognize beneath surface martha emotional tick time bomb gun brilliantly use face convey elation naughtiness rage pain emotional blankness ease facility equal gadd donny indeed two make uncomfortably powerful match baby reindeer time prevent go must least pass say nava mau nina sosanya tom goodman hill shalom brune franklin give sensational performance support role contribute flesh dark powerful story one netflix good several year

1	"It is excellent as a soapie with character development. Exposing their ""real"" side as the story progresses, if that is believable; it does keep it interesting..This isn't a realistic portrayal of anything LE. One episode they are shooting bad guys in the legs, the next episode they wouldn't be able to hit a barn door.There are some continuity issues, but given the low bar on all entertainment these days, i suppose we can/should accept that(?)I like Nathan Fillion, with him being an actor, and a human being, but his character would have been better as a shrink, not a police officer.It isn't a bad show, but it is Hollywood (as the protagonist mentions a few times)."	excellent soapie character development expose real side story progress believable keep interest realistic portrayal anything le one episode shoot bad guy leg next episode able hit barn door continuity issue give low bar entertainment day suppose accept like nathan fillion actor human character would well shrink police officer bad show hollywood protagonist mention time
0	I actually don't understand how this show has such a good rating, It's just too much drama; and not the good one with which you feel the actors pain... no, it's the cheesy one; sometimes even pathetic. I watched several season, just because my girlfriend liked it and I can properly say that it doesn't describe at all how being a doctor is and the quantity of natural disasters or weird emergency's that happen each season, is just to much... The thing that disappointed me the most was the actors. I mean when you see the cast you expect a very decent acting here, and don't get me wrong some of them do a good job in some episodes or season, for example Chandra Wilson does a very good job in the first season, but the main character, the ''star'' of the show is just awful... For me there are to many cons and not enough pros, if the show is on TV and you have nothing to do you might watch an episode, but this is not a show that will be remembered when the years pass... Trust me...	actually understand show good rat much drama good one feel actor pain cheesy one sometimes even pathetic watch several season girlfriend like properly say describe doctor quantity natural disaster weird emergency happen season much thing disappoint actor mean see cast expect decent act get wrong good job episode season example chandra wilson good job first season main character star show awful many con enough pro show tv nothing might watch episode show remember year pass trust

0	As long as you are willing to admit to yourself this is Hollywood, and be willing to suspend reality you will find this entertaining. Now I am not talking about massively ridiculous inaccuracies, just your typical Hollywood inaccuracies. For instance, the typical Hollywood way of portraying the use of force by law enforcement. Reality is the following, if a criminal has a weapon drawn or tries to draw a weapon, law enforcement will immediately shoot you. Hollywood shows law enforcement telling people to put the weapon down when a like is under threat. Law enforcement only does that if distance, or additional movement would be required for an immediate threat to life to exist. I cant help but wonder if Hollywood has changed the public's expectations or perceptions of how law enforcement reacts to resistance. I also wonder if this Hollywood induced misconception has led to life threatening problems between the public and police.	long will admit hollywood will suspend reality find entertain talk massively ridiculous inaccuracy typical hollywood inaccuracy instance typical hollywood way portray use force law enforcement reality follow criminal weapon draw try draw weapon law enforcement immediately shoot hollywood show law enforcement tell people put weapon like threat law enforcement distance additional movement would require immediate threat life exist can not help wonder hollywood change public expectation perception law enforcement react resistance also wonder hollywood induce misconception lead life threaten problem public police
2	This tv adaptation of the talented Mr Ripley has been filmed in a Hitchcock style in black and white around the cities and countryside of Italy. Obviously having Andrew Scott in it has a great appeal. However, it starts slow, very slow and actually Scott's Ripley isn't very likeable. I wondered why spend hours watching this when I could watch the film? In fact initially Ripley really has so little appeal and I was wondering if this might be a different spin on the plot where he isn't talented? Keep watching though it is immensely enjoyable once you get into it. Without spoiling anything you may watch astounded at some of the characters (policemen) and their laziness or bad luck, yet it slowly spins a plot and spins faster towards an ending. You will be satisfied by the ending and the cameo by a former Ripley. So indulge and be patient, travel to Italy and get unexplainable wealth.	tv adaptation talente mr ripley film hitchcock style black white around city countryside italy obviously andrew scott great appeal however start slow slow actually scott ripley likeable wonder spend hour watch could watch film fact initially ripley really little appeal wonder might different spin plot talente keep watch though immensely enjoyable get without spoil anything may watch astound character policeman laziness bad luck yet slowly spin plot spin fast towards end satisfy end cameo former ripley indulge patient travel italy get unexplainable wealth

2	Although an utterly engrossing and fascinating story, what is so memorable about this is how it looks. Over the years films and TV shows have often tried to be arty, frequently resulting in pompous and cringy pretentiousness. Without wanting to sound pretentious myself, this is the truest most beautiful piece of art I've seen for many a year. It gives you that same awe inspiring feeling of amazement as when you walk into St Vitus Cathedral or see the Taj Mahal for the first time.This is as close to perfection as you can get but to be critical and needlessly picky, I suppose it could be said that it feels a little slow at times. Audiences used to fast moving, all-action dramas might not appreciate this as much as some of us. That pace which gradually ramps up is necessary. It allows you not just to get to know Ripley (played brilliantly by Andrew Scott) but to get to know exactly how he feels and what he's thinking. The genius of this production is that we find ourselves rooting for Ripley, a thoroughly detestable human being. He's got no redeeming features whatsoever yet as much as we grow to passionately detest him, we find ourselves hoping against hope that he's going to get away with it all. It's so exceptionally well written that we're taken on the journey with him and all of his emotional experiences and anxieties.Is it right to enjoy such unpleasantness?	although utterly engross fascinate story memorable look year film tv show often try arty frequently result pompous cringy pretentiousness without want sound pretentious true beautiful piece art see many year give awe inspire feel amazement walk st vitus cathedral see taj mahal first time close perfection get critical needlessly picky suppose could say feel little slow time audience use fast move action drama might appreciate much we pace gradually ramp necessary allow get know ripley play brilliantly andrew scott get know exactly feel think genius production find root ripley thoroughly detestable human get redeem feature whatsoever yet much grow passionately detest find hop hope go get away exceptionally well write take journey emotional experience anxiety right enjoy unpleasantness
2	I'm really enjoying this show, I only have one and a half episodes left.I don't have much knowledge of the game, but as the show goes , it is way better than most shows coming out nowadays.I love that this show is not afraid to show character flaws and they do a good job of showing how ppl turn out based off life experiences. It is refreshing to see characters that have to over come adversity. It is a very much needed break from what Hollywood has done to female leads and their male counter parts in the last few years.The only character/ issue that I am having is Maximus. It took me a while to pinpoint what bothered me about the character, and I think it's the fact that he reminds me of a confused and angry teenager that is just now learning the ways of the world. His emotions go back and forth too much for me and his actions don't feel consistent. It doesn't help that I can't for the life of me figure out how old he is supposed to be. I assumed he was a 45 to 50 year old man when he was first introduced, this gave me a certain expectation in behavior, so I was caught off guard when he started acting the way he did, he seemed bitter, immature, and naive at times, brave sometimes , but other times a complete coward, they tried to make him look like a good guy, but his actions said otherwise.Anyway, I just found out that he is 34 in real life so he was probably 33 when he filmed.. I guess I'll find out for sure how old he is once I watch the last 2 episodes.Other than that, I'm loving the show, and the whole Maximus thing doesn't bother me too much, but it does take me out of the show every now and then.	really enjoy show one half episode leave much knowledge game show go way well show come nowadays love show afraid show character flaw good job show ppl turn base life experience refresh see character come adversity much need break hollywood do female lead male counter part last year character issue maximus take pinpoint bother character think fact remind confuse angry teenager learn way world emotion go back forth much action feel consistent help life figure old suppose assume year old man first introduce give certain expectation behavior catch guard start act way seem bitter immature naive time brave sometimes time complete coward try make look like good guy action say otherwise anyway find real life probably film guess find sure old watch last episode love show whole maximus thing bother much take show every
2	Do hope this series will get another season. I never play the game but do know bout bits and pieces of the lore (thank you video essay) and this series is very entertaining and well done.The story is engaging. Simple and yet amazingly well put. The violence is very... violent. Over the top, lots of gruesome stuffs that made me look away from the screen or just cringe, but like it fits the wasteland and the situation they are in.Theres only an editing error or like splicing (?) that doesn't make sense and put me out of the story, but other than that, I enjoyed every minute of it. Kinda sad that the s1 is finish and who knows when the next season will be out.I like the characters. Lucy is very nice as a protagonist. She started as someone who is quite naive because of her upbringing to become a survivor without truly losing herself.I love the ghoul character, though it reminded me so much of that character in westworld.I also love the musics and the retro 60s aesthethic contrasted with apocalypse. Always something I enjoyed to see from the fallout games.Also big shout to the best girl, the doggo. Cx404 / Dogmeat, you are amazing.	hope series get another season never play game know bout bit piece lore thank video essay series entertain well do story engage simple yet amazingly well put violence violent top lot gruesome stuff make look away screen cringe like fit wasteland situation there s edit error like splice make sense put story enjoy every minute kinda sad finish know next season like character lucy nice protagonist start someone quite naive upbringing become survivor without truly lose love ghoul character though remind much character westworld also love music retro aesthethic contrast apocalypse always something enjoy see fallout game also big shout good girl doggo cx dogmeat amaze
0	Having never played the game I am scoring, and reviewing, this solely on the merits of the TV show, and compared to other shows (for example Halo, Into the Badlands, Shadows and Bones), it tries too hard to look and feel dystopian to maintain suspension of disbelief.Every opportunity is used to play some old 50's/60's music could not more feel like someone got a free jukebox and insists that it be used in every scene, even when the music has zero bearing on the scenes and does nothing to evoke the feelings the director undoubtedly intended to invoke.I might give it a chance to see how it develops but based on just the first two episodes it's a hard storyline to follow and any and all cohesion between the different storylines to allow non-Fallout-gamers to get seemed to have gotten lost in translation, with too much time spent on trying to force feed you the rather poorly presented misery of the world, instead of using that time to let the dystopian-ness reveal itself through solid story-telling.	never play game score review solely merit tv show compare show example halo badland shadow bone try hard look feel dystopian maintain suspension disbelief every opportunity use play old music could feel like someone get free jukebox insist use every scene even music zero bear scene nothing evoke feel director undoubtedly intend invoke might give chance see develop base first two episode hard storyline follow cohesion different storyline allow non fallout gamer get seem get lose translation much time spend try force fee rather poorly present misery world instead use time let dystopian ness reveal solid story tell

I think I just saw him in a Wal Mart commercial.The lead has absolutely zero character or charisma, especially if we're to buy him as a grifter.If you can sit through eight episodes of this you must be partially comatose.

I understand the show is a drama and isn't a real life portrayal of actual police work in LA but this has gone too far. This show is garbage now. Just my opinion.	excite season season annoyingly eye roll harper character bind absurd story go far hollywood understand show drama real life portrayal actual police work la go far show garbage opinion
2	The detail and accuracy of the time makes this an unforgettable watch, as well as the graphic depictions of warfare and violence. Characterisation is strong and makes you finding sympathy/apathy alike for the array of characters presented. It may be somewhat predictable in places, especially between the 2 main male/female leads, which is my only criticism, but otherwise this is a worthy series. Cosmo Jarvis is very watchable; enigmatic and carries himself through well despite the unfamiliar landscape and terrain. Over half way through and it seems to be heading for an epic showdown, that I hope is not predictable.	detail accuracy time make unforgettable watch well graphic depiction warfare violence characterisation strong make find sympathy apathy alike array character present may somewhat predictable place especially main male female lead criticism otherwise worthy series cosmo jarvis watchable enigmatic carry well despite unfamiliar landscape terrain half way seem head epic showdown hope predictable

0	Well, I most definitely loved the book, but the series... It's okay, but somehow, I expected so much more. The first four episodes is where it all seems to happen, and the binary army computer is just beautifully made - guess crowd simulation often seems to do the trick. Episodes five to eight seem a bit of a timewaster with nothing much happening in them. Looking forward seeing The Dark Forest and Death's End, but not sure if it will be holding up to my expectations. Anyways, it's not a bad Netflix production, but it's also not one of their best. Believe that series like the Queen's Gambit would have been a whole lot less expensive to produce with ultimately a better impact. Think in this case the book still has my personal preference, but who knows, Netflix may up their game and rethink their strategy for the next two books. It just needs to be a whole lot better than this. So, not bad, but not holding up to the book.	well definitely love book series okay somehow expect much first four episode seem happen binary army computer beautifully make guess crowd simulation often seem trick episode five eight seem bite timewaster nothing much happen look forward see dark forest death end sure hold expectation anyways bad netflix production also one good believe series like queen gambit would whole lot less expensive produce ultimately well impact think case book still personal preference know netflix may game rethink strategy next two book need whole lot well bad hold book
0	The novel of Shogun originally written by James Clavell was based on the writings of William Adams, who was the first Englishman to set foot in Japan and became the trusted adviser of Japanese shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. William Adams is still a celebrated figure in Japan for building and bring western trader to the Japans. The Blackthorne character in the novel is bright, inquisitive, principled and driven. Well played by Richard Chamberlain in 1980. Maybe it was the script or the actor Cosmo Jarvis but the Blackthorne in this version is inept, mercenary and clumsy for lack of a better term. Mr Jarvis' characterization couldn't build a fire without help. It's fortunate that this iteration changed the focus on to the indigenous principals and not the Blackthorne character but it still skimmed over the palace intrigue. Also missing is Father Alvito who should be the hero when the novel is viewed in terms of Clavell's Objectivist philosophy. Toranaga played well by Hiroyuki Sanada lacks the ruthlessness of Tokugawa Ieyasu who was the real Shogun. The show is a good attempt to tell a great story but some of the characters are just not up to the challenge.	novel shogun originally write jam clavell base write william adams first englishman set foot japan become trust adviser japanese shogun tokugawa ieyasu william adams still celebrate figure japan build bring western trader japan blackthorne character novel bright inquisitive principle drive well play richard chamberlain maybe script actor cosmo jarvis blackthorne version inept mercenary clumsy lack well term mr jarvis characterization build fire without help fortunate iteration change focus indigenous principal blackthorne character still skim palace intrigue also miss father alvito hero novel view term clavell objectivist philosophy toranaga play well hiroyuki sanada lack ruthlessness tokugawa ieyasu real shogun show good attempt tell great story character challenge
2	"As a longtime fan of Fallout, especially New Vegas and 4, I was looking forward to this series since I saw the trailer a month prior. I binge watched the entire series in two days, and I wasn't disappointed at all.In typical Fallout fashion, the story takes place in on a post-nuclear apocalyptic world, particularly the ruins of Los Angeles, California. We follow three main, widely varying, protagonists.First, there's Lucy Maclean, a naive but determined and idealistic Vault Dweller who leaves her home, Vault 3, to find her father who was abducted by a Raider chieftain named Moldaver.Next, there's Maximus, a downtrodden aspirant of the Brotherhood of Steel who gets unexpectedly promoted to squire.And finally, we have Howard Cooper aka The Ghoul, the most cynical, jaded, and experienced protagonist who was once a pre-war actor before becoming a mercenary after the apocalypse.You'll also see longtime Fallout canine character, Dogmeat for you dog-lovers out there.The main plot of first season revolves around a wild-goose chase for the severed head of a scientist named Dr. Wilzig, which carries a big secret that could change the entire world. From there, the main story expands into a few sub plots for each character in an immerse and creative manner.First of all, the aesthetic was superb and fully captured the game in every category. From the Vault to the wasteland, to the very items, weapons, enemies, items, etc. Everything matches the source material. You'll almost feels like you're playing a Fallout game as you watch the show. Plus, the action sequences were as exciting as they were fitting for a Fallout setting. Longtime fans will definitely be reminded of their past combat experiences with the slow motion intervals.There was plenty of character development and interactions among all three characters. Lucy becomes tougher and more hardened by the harsh realities of the wasteland (among other things). Maximus becomes disillusioned with the Brotherhood, yet ironically a respected member in the process, and even forms a romance with Lucy, and Cooper eventually transforms from an enemy to an uneasy ally to Lucy as they continue their journey.The music was a captivating mix of different sources. There is an original soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi, who took inspiration from Fallout composer Inon Zur himself. Plus, you'll hear multiple original songs and leitmotifs that any Fallout fan with recognize from past games, and plenty of golden oldies from real musical artists such as Johnny Cash, Dinah Washington, and The Inkspots.The special effects were a breathtaking mixture of CGI and practical effects that fully capture the Fallout universe. The mutant creatures, such as Radroaches, Gulpers, and a Yao Guai. Personally, I can't wait to see a Deathclaw. I especially liked the Brotherhood Knights dressed in their T-60 power armor suits.Overall, this show succeeded where ""Halo"" failed and is a must watch for Fallout fans or just about anyone interested in the post-apocalyptic genre."	longtime fan fallout especially new vegas look forward series since see trailer month prior binge watch entire series two day disappoint typical fallout fashion story take place post nuclear apocalyptic world particularly ruin los angeles california follow three main widely vary protagonist first lucy maclean naive determine idealistic vault dweller leave home vault find father abduct raider chieftain name moldaver next maximus downtrodden aspirant brotherhood steel get unexpectedly promote squire finally howard cooper aka ghoul cynical jade experience protagonist pre war actor become mercenary apocalypse also see longtime fallout canine character dogmeat dog lover main plot first season revolve around wild goose chase sever head scientist name dr wilzig carry big secret could change entire world main story expand sub plot character immerse creative manner first aesthetic superb fully capture game every category vault wasteland item weapon enemy item etc everything match source material almost feel like play fallout game watch show plus action sequence excite fit fallout set longtime fan definitely remind past combat experience slow motion interval plenty character development interaction among three character lucy become tough harden harsh reality wasteland among thing maximus become disillusion brotherhood yet ironically respect member process even form romance lucy cooper eventually transform enemy uneasy ally lucy continue journey music captivate mix different source original soundtrack ramin djawadi take inspiration fallout composer inon zur plus hear multiple original song leitmotifs fallout fan recognize past game plenty golden oldie real musical artist johnny cash dinah washington inkspots special effect breathtake mixture cgi practical effect fully capture fallout universe mutant creature radroache gulper yao guai personally wait see deathclaw especially like brotherhood knight dress power armor suit overall show succeed halo fail must watch fallout fan anyone interest post apocalyptic genre
2	"Season 1 is good, Season 2 even better. Season 3: I genuinely like and appreciate as they are having the characters interact and goof around more. There is more explanation to smaller details of the cop routine and their rules. They didn't ""Hollywood ending"" Nathan Fillion's character to a mistake he made in Season 2. I honestly thought they would this season 3. Instead, a new character arch for him as well as a couple of the other Rookies and seasoned training officers. I find it odd they (the bad reviews about the show ""going woke"" or downhill) expect a cop show to continue with out addressing any issues that are going on today. I particularly really liked Season 3, episode 9, called Amber. They intelligently addressed many of the issues/questions today's cops have to deal with. I was genuinely really impressed with how they made that work into the show and how it was handled. Take my advice, take the bad reviews of season 3 with a grain of salt. This is a genuinely good show with sincere intentions of wanting you to understand the life, big or small problems, of a cop."	season good season even well season genuinely like appreciate character interact goof around explanation small detail cop routine rule hollywood end nathan fillion character mistake make season honestly think would season instead new character arch well couple rookie season train officer find odd bad review show go wake downhill expect cop show continue address issue go today particularly really like season episode call amber intelligently address many issue question today cop deal genuinely really impress make work show handle take advice take bad review season grain salt genuinely good show sincere intention want understand life big small problem cop

2	This is not one of the normal boring soap operas. Me and my girlfriend watched one episode and after that we were hooked. This will force you to wait all week for Tuesday night to see what is waiting for you in Grey's anatomy.It is about 5 inturn doctors at a hospital, and you follow their work life as well as their private life. There is really nothing special to the content and we know it from other productions as well. But it just have something special. Maybe it is a combination of the way the story is told, combined with good actors. Maybe it just have that unexplainable IT. If you haven't seen this yet I'll strongly recommend you to give it a try.	one normal bore soap opera girlfriend watch one episode hook force wait week tuesday night see wait grey anatomy inturn doctor hospital follow work life well private life really nothing special content know production well something special maybe combination way story tell combine good actor maybe unexplainable see yet strongly recommend give try
1	"Firstly, and this applies to the games as well, 200 years is way too far-fetched. Industrialized civilizations could have risen twice-over. It gives me the impression the games, and thus this show, were originally designed for 20 years after the war. Enough time for a post-war generation to reach adulthood and entropy to catch-up to vault-dwellers, but then some seagull flew in and went ""no, make it TWO HUNDRED YEARS!!"", but by then it was too late to change all the artwork. So mentally knock a zero off that number and it'll go-down more easily.Ayways, the show is a mild dark comedy set in a fantasy retro-future, but a little slow at times, a little sparse with the comedy.Lucy worked well as a sheltered vault-dweller and she evolves over the series. Maximus is an interesting flawed character, not likable but clearly has some growing-up to do. Howard is Cad Bane. Dogmeat had way more personality than in the game, but they missed a golden opportunity with the booby-traps (searh: goddamn it dogmeat)... maybe next season.The Brotherhood were well portrayed, though they kinda glossed over the purity thing, and having a lame old-man in-charge didn't quite fit with their might-is-right ideology. Vault dwellers were a bit too hammy, not enough internal farce & own-goals as suggested by the games. We don't see much of the Enclave or other factions.There's only one robot, and there are no orcs (aka super-mutants), which is probably for the best given the current state of vfx. Mr Gutsy was sorely missed, as was some of the vicious anti-communist rhetoric from the games. Also missing was the all-important looting. Not looting a corpse naked is a bit of a Fallout faux pas, likewise not carrying-off the entire contents of a lair.The story is pretty tiresome: yet another daddy-issues production (I often wonder why Americans pump-out so many of these). There's some mystery surrounding the vaults and a certain raider, but with the usual predictable we're the baddies outcome. The games had similar problems, but at least there you could completely ignore it to do your own thing, especially Fallout4 (2014). Here we're forced to ride along Lucy's linear monothreaded quest for her dad, which in itself didn't feel compelling as we don't know much about either of them, even by the end. The story of Maximus was more interesting as his mistakes & lies start to snowball into a Flashmanesque victory, but again we really don't know enough about the character to care that much. Bane was more fleshed out, but so at odds with his pre-war persona, will be interesting to see how/why he became so cruel. I suspect Lucy's dad represents an amalgam the player from the different games, given the trail of destruction in his wake.Besides the excellent robot, Vfx here was pretty distracting, like early 00's BSG cylons distracting. Milky cataract compositing, white skies, softglows, poorly animated power-armor, unfinished gulpers and the deep dark abyss of Howard's gaping nose-hole. After witnessing all of this I go back to look at Transformers (2007 - seventeen years ago) and lament: ""what happened to you vfx, you used to be beautiful"".Sets were mostly great, but ruined by the cg in many cases. Lighting was all over the place, from natural sunlit to overcast to stage lit, sometimes in the same sequence. There were no radstorms. Costumes & props were nowhere near as good as those in Fallout4, some of the BG & minor characters looked like cosplayers, and quite a few were well-fed & indoorsy.Music was either great (historical recordings) or forgettable (the rest). The scene with the 'music critics' was hilarious."	firstly apply game well year way far fetch industrialize civilization could rise twice give impression game thus show originally design year war enough time post war generation reach adulthood entropy catch vault dweller seagull fly go make two hundred year late change artwork mentally knock zero number go easily ayway show mild dark comedy set fantasy retro future little slow time little sparse comedy lucy work well shelter vault dweller evolve series maximus interest flaw character likable clearly grow howard cad bane dogmeat way personality game miss golden opportunity booby trap searh goddamn dogmeat maybe next season brotherhood well portray though kinda gloss purity thing lame old man charge quite fit might right ideology vault dweller bite hammy enough internal farce goal suggest game see much enclave faction one robot orcs aka super mutant probably well give current state vfx mr gutsy sorely miss vicious anti communist rhetoric game also miss important loot loot corpse naked bite fallout faux pas likewise carry entire content lair story pretty tiresome yet another daddy issue production often wonder americans pump many mystery surround vault certain raider usual predictable baddie outcome game similar problem least could completely ignore thing especially fallout force ride along lucy linear monothreade quest dad feel compel know much either even end story maximus interest mistake lie start snowball flashmanesque victory really know enough character care much bane flesh odd pre war persona interest see become cruel suspect lucy dad represent amalgam player different game give trail destruction wake besides excellent robot vfx pretty distract like early bsg cylon distract milky cataract composite white sky softglow poorly animate power armor unfinished gulper deep dark aby howard gap nose hole witness go back look transformer seventeen year ago lament happen vfx use beautiful set mostly great ruin cg many case light place natural sunlit overcast stage light sometimes sequence radstorm costume prop nowhere near good fallout bg minor character look like cosplayer quite well feed indoorsy music either great historical record forgettable rest scene music critic hilarious
1	I used to love Grey's Anatomy except for the stupid McDreamy nonsense, but these last 2 seasons have really gone downhill in my opinion.There's just no depth to the show anymore. The writing isn't great, even the acting seems lackluster to me. And this season finale felt rushed & far reaching. Like they didn't know where to go with the episode so they just patched things together.It feels more like a cheap soap opera now whereas it didn't feel like that to me when it first started.Even the ending within the season finale was like what??? I didn't feel ANY chemistry between the 2 of them at any point this season, & this is the direction you are going in??? Really????It all seems VERY desperate to keep a dead show running.	use love grey anatomy except stupid mcdreamy nonsense last season really go downhill opinion depth show anymore write great even act seem lackluster season finale feel rush far reach like know go episode patch thing together feel like cheap soap opera whereas feel like first start even end within season finale like feel chemistry point season direction go really seem desperate keep dead show run
2	This was a slow burner. So much so, I had to watch it twice. But it has a lot going for it. No surprise that the cinematography, and general storyboarding is excellent, but the story itself brings some novel concepts to sci fi. I think astrophysics undergrad courses are going to feel the effects of this series... Without wrecking it for everyone, the story and concept is excellent, believable, and up there with Dune. There are many great moments, and some great black humor but the end of life scene acting was phenomenal and heart wrenching. And Eiza Gonzalez...Well , and I've probably wrecked it now, but I have to say she is the hottest girl in sci-fi I've ever seen. Hotter even than seven of nine.I can't wait for the next 3 series if they get the go ahead. There is just so much scope left in this story. 400+ years of scope, in fact.	slow burner much watch twice lot go surprise cinematography general storyboarde excellent story bring novel concept sci fi think astrophysic undergrad course go feel effect series without wreck everyone story concept excellent believable dune many great moment great black humor end life scene act phenomenal heart wrench eiza gonzalez well probably wreck say hot girl sci fi ever see hot even seven nine wait next series get go ahead much scope leave story year scope fact
1	"I understand that the original story was so complicated that it was not possible to fit it all into one season series. Netflix had to make some deft adaptations to make it work, cutting some characters or amalgamating some into one. However, they felt it was important to incorporate a romantic sub-plot, which had nothing to do with the original story. This changed the genre from a hard sci-fi to a romantic, light sci-fi, coming-of-age story.The casting choices were terrible, especially for Auggie. I HATED this actress's selection so much. No offense to scientists out there, but there is no way on Earth a top scientist would look like a 23-year-old supermodel with super-long eyelashes and filled-in duck lips. If they did, then I would be worried about the research they conduct. She does not emit an aura of intelligence befitting a scientist character, making the role very hard to believe. The Chinese roles were OK, while there was something off with Jin; again, he doesn't look too smart either, but much better than Auggie. All the faces look too ""San Francisco"" to be believable, and the ""represent all ethnicities"" agenda is very strong here.The story was so rushed that the ""epic"" feeling from the book is gone. Some of the dialogues are unnecessary and make the tone of the story feel like a teenager drama.If you have never read the book, you might enjoy this adaptation. If you are a hard sci-fi lover and have read the book, you better avoid this adaptation."	understand original story complicate possible fit one season series netflix make deft adaptation make work cut character amalgamate one however feel important incorporate romantic sub plot nothing original story change genre hard sci fi romantic light sci fi come age story cast choice terrible especially auggie hat actress selection much offense scientist way earth top scientist would look like year old supermodel super long eyelash fill duck lip would worry research conduct emit aura intelligence befit scientist character make role hard believe chinese role ok something jin look smart either much well auggie face look san francisco believable represent ethnicity agenda strong story rush epic feel book go dialogue unnecessary make tone story feel like teenager drama never read book might enjoy adaptation hard sci fi lover read book well avoid adaptation
0	I think it was not right that people are led to believe this is a stalking story. Yes there is stalking but I felt it was not the main theme and there was no message that could be helpful for those who are going through this problem. It was more about Richard's life and I am not sure if all this was a cynical move from him to get fame - after all he would do anything for that as he said himself. I found this story quite weak and I didn't emphatise with his character at all. I felt some scenes were also too violent when there was no need for it.The only likeable character was Teri and but again part of her storyline there was weak because surely she could have sued Martha for the aggression.Overall, I liked the first two episodes and that's it.	think right people lead believe stalk story yes stalk feel main theme message could helpful go problem richard life sure cynical move get fame would anything say find story quite weak emphatise character feel scene also violent need likeable character teri part storyline weak surely could sue martha aggression overall like first two episode

There are moments in this show that are so funny but then in the next breath so sad. It is had to put it in a category of what it is as it covers so many topics. The Acting is superb and the fact it is based on a true story makes it even more so crazy. It realy shines a light on how the world thinks and acts sometimes. There are some realy gard to watch moments in this but if you can get through them then this a must watch.

2	Season 1-6= 10/10 Season 7= 8/10 Season 8= 6/10Season 1-6 of Game Of Thrones is masterful, some of the best Television, or story I have seen. Character deaths, shocking, engaging, fantastic dialogue, incredible twists, intense, awesome battles, violent, incredible story and nuanced and complex characters with incredible world building and characters that you just fall in love with, with incredible arcs (Jaime, Cersei, Jon, Tyrion, Danerys, Robb, Ned etc) There is no other TV Show Like Game Of Thrones 1st 6 seasons, no other tv shows gives you the same feeling as episodes such as- Baelor, The Rains Of Castamere, Blackwater, Battle Of The Bastards, Laws Of Gods And Men, The Winds Of Winter, Hardhome, Mother's Mercy etc. Game Of Thrones S1-6 are easily a 10/10.Season 7 isn't as good as those 6 seasons, its still great television with awesome episodes such as The Spoils Of War and 'The Dragon And The Wolf' and Jaimie and Cersei Lannister are the best they've been (my personal favourite 2 characters). But the pacing feels a bit off, ep 5 and 6 feel rushed, disjointed and more generic. It's a set up season for S8 and while its still a great season of TV, you can see where it started to go a bit downhill. Still a solid entry in the GOT Saga.Season 8 is hugely disappointing, Great battles, music, production and acting. the story, characters, pacing and writing are not good. It's too crammed with too many stories and characters to fit in only 6 episodes and The ending of The Long Night negates the entire theme of Game Of Thrones, leaving for a disappointing 2nd half. Also, what they did with Jaimie Lanister and The Night King is unforgivable, GOT always shocked fans with great twists, but in S8 it's shocking at the expense of telling a good story.Even tho S8 is disappointing, GOT is still absolutely worth the watch, its one of a kind TV Show and the first 7 seasons are 100% worth watching.	season season season season game throne masterful good television story see character death shock engage fantastic dialogue incredible twist intense awesome battle violent incredible story nuance complex character incredible world build character fall love incredible arc jaime cersei jon tyrion danerys robb ned etc tv show like game throne st season tv show give feel episode baelor rain castamere blackwater battle bastard law god man wind winter hardhome mother mercy etc game throne easily season good season still great television awesome episode spoil war dragon wolf jaimie cersei lannister good personal favourite character pace feel bite ep feel rush disjoint generic set season still great season tv see start go bite downhill still solid entry get saga season hugely disappoint great battle music production act story character pace write good cram many story character fit episode end long night negate entire theme game throne leave disappoint nd half also jaimie lanister night king unforgivable get always shock fan great twist shock expense tell good story even tho disappoint get still absolutely worth watch one kind tv show first season worth watch
0	"This is my first review on IMDB.I recently read the book and found it enormously difficult to finish. There are dozens of characters. They all (with the exception of Ye Wenjie) seemed like human icebergs, no soul, no layers. The pace of the book is chaotic, full of science that honestly bored me. I'm a fan of Asimov, Sagan, Kaku, Stephen Hawking ... but the way Cixin Liu delivers the science seemed pompous and worthy of a draft. Let's see, Asimov, one of the most brilliant minds of humanity, when he wrote fiction, he cared about plot, about logic, about characters, and he didn't need to throw all his science wisdom at us; he did that in his non-fiction books.Also, for a book that claims to be extremely scientific, it feels outdated and incongruous. I thought the Netflix series would improve these aspects, that it would at least heat up such a cold book, and they partly did, but the story of the book is what it is. And on top of that, they added aspects that also make little sense (even from the other two books) yet simply make the plot holes become black holes.True, some characters in the series are somewhat Soap Opera-like, etc. But there are bigger problems: the main plot. The biggest problem with the series is the story as such, and this is because of the book.1.- If Ye Wenjie receives a warning signal from a race that is theoretically incapable of lying, warning her at least five times not to respond, then why is there any hope for the Lord? The signal is warning her that they are going to invade them, and Ye thinks it's salvation? No, Ye thinks it's punishment and that humans deserve to be annihilated. But neither in the book, nor in the Netflix series do they develop this dilemma well. Sometimes, you think Ye made the choice for the sake of humanity in the long run, sometimes simply for retribution. It could be both options, but it doesn't make much sense. Why is Ye astonished when the San-ti call humans ""bugs"" if they warned her from the beginning that they would go after them?2.- How is it possible that scientists commit suicide just because their data doesn't add up? That doesn't befit a scientist. Science faces challenges all the time. Just now, the Webb is causing a stir in the scientific community, and that is exciting, not depressing. In the series and in the book, the scientists act more like mystics who have lost faith, rather than scientists who want to dig deeper and deeper. In the real world, they may feel frustrated, defeated, for a moment, but mass suicide? Nope. If it is because the San-ti are manipulating their minds directly, then all is lost, because the San-ti can do the same to the prominent leaders of humanity, etc. If it is simply because of the failure of science at certain points, suicide by scientists is unrealistic and absurd.If you need to remove a hard disk from a ship, how is it possible that the best solution is to use nanofibers and to kill everybody? After all, nanofibers are only very powerful and very small blades. The odds of the nanofiber also destroying the hard drive are almost 100 percent. Besides, there were children on that ship. On the other hand, wasn't it better to perform a surgical operation and catch Mike Evans ( ghastly underdeveloped) and seize the technology that was on the ship, the hard drive, etc.? That whole scene makes no sense; it's there just for the Wow effect. Also, for a scientist to lend herself to this, after so much struggle, is a terrible decision for the character.4.- The Sophon is the end of the game. The San-ti can know everything humans do and manipulate what they see. They can make the stars twinkle, place an eye in the sky, make the sky look like a mirror. So isn't it obvious that they can make humanity destroy itself in a few years? It is extremely simple for them. The options are endless. They can collapse power plants, water plants. They can alter atomic bombs (more or less a la Skynet in Terminator)... Besides, if the sophon watches over humans, how come the San-ti didn't know that humans lie? And with the sophon, it's impossible for humans to strategize, since the sophon will always know everything.5.- For the convenience of the script and the book, the sophon cannot read minds. But then again, it doesn't need to. Well, after such a plot hole, humans publicly say they are going to create the walfacer project. Another project that makes no sense. This is from the second book. Dark Forest. SPOILERS FROM, BOOK TWO START HERE!!!!Let's see, that book was written in 2008, before Kepler and Webb. Now we know there are thousands of planets (only in the Milky Way) and many of them could be like Earth. The Dark Forest theory to explain the Fermi paradox is quite poor. I don't mean that it is pessimistic, but rather lame. According to this theory, if someone in space with more technology than us discovers us, we are more or less doomed. But I don't think that's true, since a civilization capable of mastering dimensions (as demonstrated in the third book) should also be able to see and detect us, and yet we're still here. They would only attack if they felt threatened by us, but we are completely harmless to space. The San-ti are right: we are bugs. So what is the stress of killing whatever you see in a dark forest if you are more powerful. That is justifiable for unintelligent predators. It is as if an Orca sailed in the dark sea, and upon seeing a small fish, killed it out of fear, not hunger. The Orca is above such an instinctive survival decision. Besides, the universe is not a dark forest for civilizations that have been able to develop some technology. Even we have ways of seeing the cosmos. Anyway, this theory, and the way they apply it in the book to make a pact with the San-ti (I repeat, a pact when the San-ti have the sophon, which is practically God) is quite absurd. It is to think that the universe is reduced to a jungle full of snakes whose only objective is to survive and not to be killed. It is extremely simplistic.END OF SPOILERS FROM BOOK TWO!!!!!6.- The whole plot of bringing a human brain to space and giving it to the San-ti (this is from the third book) doesn't make any sense either. What can humanity win by doing this? Besides, the San-ti have been studying us for decades with the sophon. I insist, the sophon slays any plot that may come after it, turning them into far-fetched and far-fetched decisions and scenes. Could they be mind-blowings? Uh, if they make any sense, yes. Otherwise, they're just imaginative scenes (science-based mostly) just to be contrived for the sake of being gimmicky."	first review imdb recently read book find enormously difficult finish dozen character exception ye wenjie seem like human iceberg soul layer pace book chaotic full science honestly bore fan asimov sagan kaku stephen hawk way cixin liu deliver science seem pompous worthy draft let see asimov one brilliant mind humanity write fiction care plot logic character need throw science wisdom we non fiction book also book claim extremely scientific feel outdate incongruous think netflix series would improve aspect would least heat cold book partly story book top add aspect also make little sense even two book yet simply make plot hole become black hole true character series somewhat soap opera like etc big problem main plot big problem series story book ye wenjie receive warn signal race theoretically incapable lie warn least five time respond hope lord signal warn go invade ye think salvation ye think punishment human deserve annihilate neither book netflix series develop dilemma well sometimes think ye make choice sake humanity long run sometimes simply retribution could option make much sense ye astonish san ti call human bug warn begin would go possible scientist commit suicide datum add befit scientist science face challenge time webb cause stir scientific community excite depress series book scientist act like mystic lose faith rather scientist want dig deeply deep real world may feel frustrate defeat moment mass suicide nope san ti manipulate mind directly lose san ti prominent leader humanity etc simply failure science certain point suicide scientist unrealistic absurd need remove hard disk ship possible good solution use nanofiber kill everybody nanofiber powerful small blade odd nanofiber also destroy hard drive almost percent besides child ship hand well perform surgical operation catch mike evans ghastly underdevelop seize technology ship hard drive etc whole scene make sense wow effect also scientist lend much struggle terrible decision character sophon end game san ti know everything human manipulate see make star twinkle place eye sky make sky look like mirror obvious make humanity destroy year extremely simple option endless collapse power plant water plant alter atomic bomb less la skynet terminator besides sophon watch human come san ti know human lie sophon impossible human strategize since sophon always know everything convenience script book sophon read mind need well plot hole human publicly say go create walfacer project another project make sense second book dark forest spoiler book two start let see book write kepler webb know thousand planet milky way many could like earth dark forest theory explain fermi paradox quite poor mean pessimistic rather lame accord theory someone space technology we discover we less doom think true since civilization capable master dimension demonstrate third book also able see detect we yet still would attack feel threaten we completely harmless space san ti right bug stress kill whatever see dark forest powerful justifiable unintelligent predator orca sail dark sea upon see small fish kill fear hunger orca instinctive survival decision besides universe dark forest civilization able develop technology even way see cosmos anyway theory way apply book make pact san ti repeat pact san ti sophon practically god quite absurd think universe reduce jungle full snake whose objective survive kill extremely simplistic end spoiler book two whole plot bring human brain space give san ti third book make sense either humanity win besides san ti study we decade sophon insist sophon slay plot may come turn far fetch far fetch decision scene could mind blow uh make sense yes otherwise imaginative scene science base mostly contrive sake gimmicky
2	I knew I was going to enjoy this from the start. I've never seen any of the other versions so can't compare it. The 1960s 'film noir' way in which it was filmed gives it such a sinister feel, which wouldn't be the same had it been filmed in colour. Andrew Scott is new to me, but is a perfect fit for the character he plays. I'm only at the first episode so hope it lives up to its early promise. I would imagine a lot of the exterior scenery that show up on here, and the interior of some of the grand buildings featured hasn't changed much since the era in which this series is supposedly set. 10 out of 10 for sure.	know go enjoy start never see version compare film noir way film give sinister feel film colour andrew scott new perfect fit character play first episode hope live early promise would imagine lot exterior scenery show interior grand build feature change much since era series supposedly set sure
0	I honestly don't think the show should've continued after season 10, when Christina Yang leaves. I hadn't watched the last two seasons until I was bored at home because of quarantine and had nothing better to do. It was terrible, I don't know why they keep insisting on making more episodes, it's just recycled story lines at this point. I wish the producers would do the kind thing and put it out of its misery while it still has a shred of dignity left.	honestly think show continue season christina yang leave watch last two season bore home quarantine nothing well terrible know keep insist make episode recycle story line point wish producer would kind thing put misery still shre dignity leave
1	3 years ago, I would've told anyone this was the best show ever made. It was, no doubt about it. The first 5 seasons are absolutely brilliant. Stunning visuals, an absolutely fantastic cast and thanks to the books, the best dialogue and writing ever to grace television. Season 6 was still amazing, however that's where it took a turn..Season 7 is where it started to drop. Characters were acting.. out of character more and more, people could seemingly teleport all over the world and the once cunning dialogue seemed to have faded quite a bit. Then came a 2 year gap with the 8th and final season, which, I feel, made a lot of people forget about the slight disappoinment that season 7 was. Huge hype and anticipation was utterly crushed by probably the worst ending I have ever seen. The quality did not just continue to go downwards, it plummeted and crashed into the ground.It's still visually stunning, the music is still breathtaking and the production quality overall is just mindblowing - except when it comes to writing. 7 seasons if storyline were butchered, including the main villain and basically all of the main characters. It wasn't a factor of me not agreeing or me not being 'happy' about it - they literally destroyed their storlyines and made them act like different people whilst all they, and therefore we had gone through, meant nothing. It's been extremely painful to see such decline in what was genuinely the best thing to grace television. I truly believe that.I'll still give it a 7. The first few seasons are without a doubt the best you'll ever see. But if you missed out or come across this in 10 years time when the next generation will find out about this phenomenon: know that the ending and the whole last season are an utter disappointment an ruin it all.	year ago would tell anyone well show ever make doubt first season absolutely brilliant stun visual absolutely fantastic cast thank book good dialogue write ever grace television season still amaze however take turn season start drop character act character people could seemingly teleport world cunne dialogue seem fade quite bite come year gap th final season feel make lot people forget slight disappoinment season huge hype anticipation utterly crush probably bad end ever see quality continue go downwards plummet crash grind still visually stun music still breathtake production quality overall mindblowing except come write season storyline butcher include main villain basically main character factor agree happy literally destroy storlyine make act like different people whilst therefore go mean nothing extremely painful see decline genuinely good thing grace television truly believe still give first season without doubt well ever see miss come across year time next generation find phenomenon know end whole last season utter disappointment ruin
1	First off, I would watch Nathan Fillion tie his shoes for an hour. He's the reason I still watch the show... well, I've grown to love Chen and Bradford, too... but the amount of medical snafus in this show are getting ridiculous. They need to get someone with a medical background to consult for the show. Sheesh... this last episode, Tim Bradford has back surgery after a dislodged bullet fragment makes him paralyzed and is back at work the following week? Someone in a car accident doesn't immediately get put into a c- collar? And why is Jenna Dewan at EVERY medical scene?? She's the worst EMT ever! Isn't Los Angeles bigger than that? Anyway, the acting is good... just fix the medical inaccuracies. Its.	first would watch nathan fillion tie shoe hour reason still watch show well grow love chen bradford amount medical snafu show get ridiculous need get someone medical background consult show sheesh last episode tim bradford back surgery dislodge bullet fragment make paralyze back work follow week someone car accident immediately get put c collar jenna dewan every medical scene bad emt ever los angeles big anyway act good fix medical inaccuracy
1	I know this sounds crazy, but the past few seasons have looked cheap and feel impersonal. It feels more like a daytime soap then an award winning drama. If this show can't make us feel anymore like it did in seasons 8 and before, then it might be time to come to a close in the next season. Don't drag out a show that can't regain its spark.	know sound crazy past season look cheap feel impersonal feel like daytime soap award win drama show make we feel anymore like season might time come close next season drag show regain spark
1	So i loved the show, the intencity of scenes and the dialogue was not hard to follow with subtitles. But I just cant rate this any higher, I do love unusual endings in shows and movies, endings that you expect the least but it felt speedrun and skipped. I Awaited an big battle with army vs army to conclude the fight between the clans and that blackthorne would have some part to ensure victoyr for lord toranaga but instead lord toranaga just reveald his plans in the near end of his show and we just have to sit there and imagine he wins the battle. It would have been fun to atleast see a smal part of the battle and atleast get a glimpse of vicory on lord toranaga's side but instead we see the armies in a future timejump as lord toranaga explains his plans and then it cuts back to the present. I know this is how the book end (i have not read it) but atleast a part of the battle could have been fun to see. But for the show overall I can comfortly rate it a 9/10 as i do like these kind of shows (slow drama) because of how intense some scenes can be as it leads up to something big and you can feel it coming slowly witch builds up an satisfying intensity. Great actors great visuals and good to watch if you like history and japan culture :D.	love show intencity scene dialogue hard follow subtitle can not rate high love unusual end show movie end expect least feel speedrun skip await big battle army vs army conclude fight clan blackthorne would part ensure victoyr lord toranaga instead lord toranaga reveald plan near end show sit imagine win battle would fun atleast see smal part battle atleast get glimpse vicory lord toranaga side instead see army future timejump lord toranaga explain plan cut back present know book end read atleast part battle could fun see show overall comfortly rate like kind show slow drama intense scene lead something big feel come slowly witch build satisfy intensity great actor great visual good watch like history japan culture

2	I have to admit that I might be a bit biased as I love Andrew Scott, but I think he really delivered. His character was complex, and while the show was slow paced, he really held attention without overdoing it. The casting in general was great, although I have to say that I felt that Freddie felt a little out of place, she looked to modern to be believable for the time period imo.Purple Noon, The Talented mr Ripley and Ripley all have different interpretations of the story. Personally I loved this slow, dark, mature black and white interpretation. The slow pace somehow made it feel more believable, as if it was happening in real time.This Ripley is older and has a history of scheming, you can tell that everyone he meets from the starts feels that something is off about him, but he does gain their trust. There is an obvious darkness about him. The black and white really portrais his dark personality well. Dickie is rich, kind and naive, living a slow paced life .If you go in expecting a different interpretation then you will absolutely love it. Just enjoy the story and the visuals.	admit might bite bias love andrew scott think really deliver character complex show slow pace really hold attention without overdo cast general great although say feel freddie feel little place look modern believable time period imo purple noon talente mr ripley ripley different interpretation story personally love slow dark mature black white interpretation slow pace somehow make feel believable happen real time ripley old history scheme tell everyone meet start feel something gain trust obvious darkness black white really portrais dark personality well dickie rich kind naive live slow pace life go expect different interpretation absolutely love enjoy story visual
1	As GoT started, the first four seasons were insanely great. The story, the characters, the mature plot points. Everything was just perfect. It was 11/10 for me then. But as the seasons passed and episodes increased, the show became dumber and dumber and dumber. The story became childish, and the premise deteriorated. And now in season 8, it feels like a bunch of kindergarten kids are given the task of writing the plot for this show.	get start first four season insanely great story character mature plot point everything perfect season pass episode increase show become dumber dumber dumb story become childish premise deteriorate season feel like bunch kindergarten kid give task write plot show

1	The initial nine seasons of the show were enjoyable, but upon further reflection, it became apparent that the portrayal of doctors and hospital practices was not an accurate representation of reality. The show's approach seemed to be more focused on mocking patients and bedside manners, which can be perceived as distasteful and disrespectful, especially for healthcare professionals who have worked in environments with high ethical and moral standards.Despite these concerns, it is worth noting that the acting skills of the cast, particularly Dr. Derek and Christina, were commendable and well-suited for their respective roles.	initial nine season show enjoyable upon reflection become apparent portrayal doctor hospital practice accurate representation reality show approach seem focus mock patient bedside manner perceive distasteful disrespectful especially healthcare professional work environment high ethical moral standard despite concern worth note act skill cast particularly dr derek christina commendable well suit respective role

But dang if they didn't absolutely nail this. It honestly feels like once the green light was given those in charge basically said, ""We got the IP to do it...now make it damn good."" The casting, the writing, the acting is so damn well done there is a surprise in every episode. The world building is second to none and keeps you engaged through-out the eight episodes.

On my mind, Tokyo Vice is so much more better in this respect. I did not read the book, I did not watch the 70th series, but this one is definitely not a piece of art. Despite all the costumes and excellent Japanese actors, whom I very much admire, this show feels superficial, with much cliche from Holywood-like acting and story-telling. I am a fan of Japan culture, but this ""creation"" has nothing to do with it, despite what authors/makers/some watchers may claim.

2	The anticipation for this show has been crazy, and so far is staying very close to the original story what's sad thing about it is the subtitles are moving so fast you don't have time to read it all which is very disappointing. At this day and time the Japanese language should be represented but slow it down some, we all are not fast readers. The patent tree is absolutely excellent and you're learning the true culture of the Japanese people in the 16th century which we may see as harsh but what culture isn't harsh.

1	Its good scify as most movies are average this one has a great cast and the pace is faster than the Chinese version. All the episodes were interesting full of concepts involving nanotechnology, A. I., computers Some parts drag it down like the love story. The best parts involve a look at the drama of the people's revolution and how repressive tyranny is and there is no masking the idiodecy of the perpetrators. Any form of fascism, religious delirium as a projection of God onto the aliens which is absurd. The premise that we are not perfect enough to pass the stringent values of another species is truely explored as we can be stomped out like bugs.	good scify movie average one great cast pace fast chinese version episode interest full concept involve nanotechnology computer part drag like love story good part involve look drama people revolution repressive tyranny mask idiodecy perpetrator form fascism religious delirium projection god onto alien absurd premise perfect enough pass stringent value another specie truely explore stomp like bug
1	These second rate writers took a 3 episode storyline and stretched it to almost 2 seasons. This storyline was shallow, repittitive and trite. I am watching one more episode and if I hear the word Elisha, this program will be dead to me.The nightmare was compounded by forcing us to watch a crossover to the FBI Rookie which is nothing more than a daytime soap opera. There is no solid storyline, character development is based on emotional tripe and the main actress Simone acts more like a high school counselor than an FBI agent.The writers for both shows should be fired and banned from any productions in the future.	second rate writer take episode storyline stretch almost season storyline shallow repittitive trite watch one episode hear word elisha program dead nightmare compound force we watch crossover fbi rookie nothing daytime soap opera solid storyline character development base emotional tripe main actress simone act like high school counselor fbi agent writer show fire ban production future

From season 3 it starts to become gripping with stuff happening, nail gripping scenes hoping your favourite character stays alive.Season 7 is decent, but trash with many plot holes and things that make no sense.Season 8 is trash tier, literally garbage that ruins the whole series as a whole.

1	"There are aspects of the ""3 Body Problem"" story that potentially make it quite bad. But I haven't decided if these aspects of the story are used to convey a deep theme about humanity's failings. For example, the solution Thomas Wade comes up with to get the hard drive storing recordings of conversations with the aliens. That is the dumbest solution ever: slice the ship up killing everyone on board! Could they not just wait for them to resupply at a port and then get a search warrant. But maybe ""3 Body Problem"" is brilliant, and this is an illustration of how humans can justify killing people. Also, in this day in age, alien invasion stories don't make sense. We now know there are millions of planets like Earth. There is no reason to invade an occupied planet. But, again, this could just be used to contrast humanity with a much more advanced species so to illustrate our failings. Finally, the mission to intercept the aliens on their path to Earth is just so dumb. What do they expect to accomplish by sending a frozen brain to them? It feels almost like a live version of ""Rick and Morty"". So, I don't know. Is ""3 Body Problem"" brilliant or stupid. I will continue to watch season 2 to find out."	aspect body problem story potentially make quite bad decide aspect story use convey deep theme humanity fail example solution thomas wade come get hard drive store record conversation alien dumbest solution ever slice ship kill everyone board could wait resupply port get search warrant maybe body problem brilliant illustration human justify kill people also day age alien invasion story make sense know million planet like earth reason invade occupy planet could use contrast humanity much advance specie illustrate fail finally mission intercept alien path earth dumb expect accomplish send freeze brain feel almost like live version rick morty know body problem brilliant stupid continue watch season find
2	Every now and again there comes along a show or movie that is so raw and heartbreaking it stops you in your tracks, baby reindeer is the first show in a very long time to do this too me. As you've probably heard now it's based on the main characters true life and no it is not just about a stalker. Although the show does an excellent job of creating the fear & dread that we associate with stalking there is also an underlying deeper sadness (you'll understand about half way through the series). Do I recommend watching the show? Absolutely if you can handle very dark subject matter. *ps, there should also be a trigger warning on episode 3, I know there is on 4 but warning for episode 3 especially for trans folk and the queer community.I loved the show but it's one I will add to the never watch again.	every come along show movie raw heartbreaking stop track baby reindeer first show long time probably hear base main character true life stalker although show excellent job create fear dread associate stalk also underlie deep sadness understand half way series recommend watch show absolutely handle dark subject matter ps also trigger warn episode know warn episode especially trans folk queer community love show one add never watch
0	"This was a slow starter. It wasn't until episode that I realised that, far from being serious science fiction, 3 Body Problem is a gloriously bonkers comedy.It wasn't easy to work out for a start as there was a pretty decent sci-fi storyline emerging in the early episodes. Unfortunately it turned out that the scenes set 60s/70s China were only provided the background for the confused main plot line.There's these scientists or something. Some of them put on VR headsets and play a fancy game made by some people on a boat because of aliens and stuff. There's also a guy who made his fortune selling snacks and his school teacher mate... it was so rushed it was hard to tell. Oh, and a boat gets chopped in half with some carbon nanotubes. Then the sky goes weird and everyone decamps to a stately home to make a nuclear bomb spaceship. Huh?The script is clunky and often laugh-out-loud bad. The only character of any interest is Liam Cunningham's Wade - perhaps the most bonkers and fun character in the whole thing. Wade is the boss of a secretive anti-alien agency which is in the unfortunate situation of having to save humanity on what looks like a budget of a couple of hundred quid. The ""agency"" starts off as just Wade and his gumshoe detective sidekick Da Shi, before rapidly expanding by hiring a Navy captain and some glum looking scientists. When the agency relocate from what looks like a 1970s office block to a stately home, the new found power and an expanded budget go to his head and Wade starts issuing increasing bizarre orders, like: build me a spaceship that can go as fast as light, wake me up from cryo-freeze so I can watch the tennis, blast a teacher's brain into orbit with nuclear bombs. He also spends quite a long time shouting at invisible alien computers (the ""siphone"", the ""cellphone""?).Maybe the book is brilliant. If so, I imagine it was more epic science fiction than batshit comedy romp. And that's the problem. Epic sci-fi is pretty... epic. Stories are often long and complex and it takes real skill to convert them into coherent, well paced scripts which are able to carry an audience without decending into absurd nonsense. It all felt a bit rushed and, ultimately, comically absurd."	slow starter episode realise far serious science fiction body problem gloriously bonker comedy easy work start pretty decent sci fi storyline emerge early episode unfortunately turn scene set china provide background confuse main plot line scientist something put vr headset play fancy game make people boat alien stuff also guy make fortune sell snack school teacher mate rush hard tell oh boat get chop half carbon nanotube sky go weird everyone decamp stately home make nuclear bomb spaceship huh script clunky often laugh loud bad character interest liam cunningham wade perhaps bonker fun character whole thing wade boss secretive anti alien agency unfortunate situation save humanity look like budget couple hundred quid agency start wade gumshoe detective sidekick da shi rapidly expand hire navy captain glum look scientist agency relocate look like office block stately home new find power expand budget go head wade start issue increase bizarre order like build spaceship go fast light wake cryo freeze watch tennis blast teacher brain orbit nuclear bomb also spend quite long time shout invisible alien computer siphone cellphone maybe book brilliant imagine epic science fiction batshit comedy romp problem epic sci fi pretty epic story often long complex take real skill convert coherent well pace script able carry audience without decende absurd nonsense feel bite rush ultimately comically absurd

1	What strikes me hard in the novel is how complex YE Wenjie is with her self-contradiction, on one hand she's lost hope in humanity because she was betrayed and she went through the manic time in China but on another, she still believed in love and tried to save humanity (with the help of San-Ti, she thought San-Ti had higher moral standards).Quite ridiculous of this show to fast forward the story of young YE Wenjie, her falling love with her husband (the guy who stole her idea of using the sun as a signal amplifier in the show while who actually helped and protected her a ton in the novel and made her feel a little warmth in human) and her being a mom with help from local villagers and her being a teacher to local village kids (again made her regret her decision of sending message out to Saniya-Ti because she felt love among humans), all the stories that make her a round person with complexity and struggles that audience can empathize with instead of just a simple villain as depicted in the show. And even more ridiculous that the show spends lots of time around meaningless romantic tangles among the friend group, which doesn't help in either storyline progressing or showing the complexity of human nature. This is not a sitcom or romcom like Friends or How I Met Your Mother, it doesn't really matter who Saul is sleeping with or whether Jin loves Will.Another thing that fascinated me in the novel is how it reveals the three-sun chaotic environment of San-Ti planet by showing the history of how human understand the universe and physics (a lot of real historical figures like ancient Chinese & European philosophers and physicists) and proves that the physic theories on earth can't be applied to San-Ti and can't help San-Ti solve their problem, therefore the only option for them is to find another habitat, earth! But again this part is fast forward in the show.It seems that the show doesn't have the patience to show the complexity of human nature and the detailed physic science as written in the book, it just wants to fill all the eye-catching special effects into a sci-fi story plus some boring romance and love stories.	strike hard novel complex ye wenjie self contradiction one hand lose hope humanity betray go manic time china another still believe love try save humanity help san ti think san ti high moral standard quite ridiculous show fast forward story young ye wenjie fall love husband guy steal idea use sun signal amplifier show actually help protect ton novel make feel little warmth human mom help local villager teacher local village kid make regret decision send message saniya ti feel love among human story make round person complexity struggle audience empathize instead simple villain depict show even ridiculous show spend lot time around meaningless romantic tangle among friend group help either storyline progress show complexity human nature sitcom romcom like friend meet mother really matter saul sleep whether jin love another thing fascinate novel reveal three sun chaotic environment san ti planet show history human understand universe physics lot real historical figure like ancient chinese european philosopher physicist prove physic theory earth apply san ti help san ti solve problem therefore option find another habitat earth part fast forward show seem show patience show complexity human nature detail physic science write book want fill eye catch special effect sci fi story plus bore romance love story

Many of the characters while amazing for other things, just didn't work right here.Perhaps the biggest disappointment was Eiza Gonzalez, who I am a fan of.I kind of knew this could be pants thanks to seeing John Bradley as one of the cast. He was in something else that bombed big style. He is rapidly becoming a ""Jonah"" figure.I don't know if something has been lost in translation from the original Chinese to this, if it has been, then it is most likely Benioff and Weiss that are to blame on that front. That or this should have just stayed Chinese.I also felt like this was almost and advertisement to encourage people to smoke again.

0	Part of Tom Ridley's engaging charm is his earnest boyishness and his eagerness to please. So why cast a nearly 50-year-old man in the role? Andrew Scott is a respected actor, but this part is all wrong for him. I've enjoyed both the Matt Damon and Alain Delon versions, where Tom's youthful beauty opens doors ~ or at least leaves them ajar. And the black-and-white photography doesn't work here. Dickie Greenleaf's life was one of technicolor luxury; let us see it in all of its Mediterranean opulence. So very disappointed by the creative decisions that mar this newest version of Patricia Hightower's thriller.	part tom ridley engage charm earnest boyishness eagerness please cast nearly year old man role andrew scott respect actor part wrong enjoy matt damon alain delon version tom youthful beauty open door least leave ajar black white photography work dickie greenleaf life one technicolor luxury let we see mediterranean opulence disappoint creative decision mar new version patricia hightower thriller
2	Baby Reindeer is a raw and gripping watch, with astonishingly nuanced writing and stellar acting to boot.A difficult watch at times, it's confronting and cautionary, with a focus more on the commonalities between the stalker and stalked in terms of the drive for attention and validation, and the relentless need to hang on to what they value, with the victim internalizing the blame and guilt for both his abuse and the longevity of the stalking.It was great to see a male victims take on abuse and stalking, as he often played down the severity of either, and seemed reluctant to consider himself a victim at all, and his relationship with Teri was compassionately and sensitively portrayed.To think that this was based on a true story is a bit mind bending, and I wonder how much of what happens is embellished for the script, but regardless of this, the story is well written and executed, and the post-production is brilliant.	baby reindeer raw grip watch astonishingly nuance write stellar act boot difficult watch time confront cautionary focus commonality stalker stalk term drive attention validation relentless need hang value victim internalize blame guilt abuse longevity stalk great see male victim take abuse stalk often play severity either seem reluctant consider victim relationship teri compassionately sensitively portray think base true story bite mind bend wonder much happen embellish script regardless story well write execute post production brilliant
2	Grey's Anatomy is a drama series made by Shonda Rhimes staring Ellen Pompeo, Patrick Dempsey etc. Centered around five surgical interns and goes through their professional and personal challenges along with fellow surgeons at Seattle Grace Hospital.As a drama lover when I first heard about this show I immediately decided to watch it and frankly the first 10 to 12 seasons were sensational and entertaining for instance the plot and the story line were so engrossing and inspiring and it even got me on the edge of my seat in some scenes. Last two episodes of each and every season was always unexpectedly nail-biting and spine-tingling. Also, the sound effects and the cast were pretty much memorable.But unfortunately, after season 12 when almost most of the original cast had left the show, it gradually turned in to an unconvincing mediocre series that I couldn't even stand watching another episode and it was definitely the time for them to end the show but surprisingly they've continued and now it's in its season 19 with the most formulaic boring stories.If you want to start watching Greys Anatomy, do it for sure but for the sake of your time and energy stop after season 12.	grey anatomy drama series make shonda rhime star ellen pompeo patrick dempsey etc center around five surgical intern go professional personal challenge along fellow surgeon seattle grace hospital drama lover first hear show immediately decide watch frankly first season sensational entertain instance plot story line engross inspire even get edge seat scene last two episode every season always unexpectedly nail bite spine tingle also sound effect cast pretty much memorable unfortunately season almost original cast leave show gradually turn unconvincing mediocre series even stand watch another episode definitely time end show surprisingly continue season formulaic bore story want start watch grey anatomy sure sake time energy stop season

0	This show had so much promise but really fell flat. They failed to develop or show any type of character arc. Who is the main character? Is it Jin, Auggie, Saul? They bounce all around between them but don't really give any of them any personality. Why you ask? Because they took 1 character from the book and turned them into 5 people trying to play off all these uninteresting and ultimately non impactful to the story interactions between them.It never really felt like there was any climax in the season. They also failed to give any development to the opposing side so you can understand their reasons for actions.	show much promise really fall flat fail develop show type character arc main character jin auggie saul bounce around really give personality ask take character book turn people try play uninteresting ultimately non impactful story interaction never really feel like climax season also fail give development oppose side understand reason action
1	"This series CGI is definitely a stunner. But the series as a whole could have been easier to like with actually sympathetic lead characters in the mix. If you watch episode 5, you will have watched perhaps the only full episode worth the hype this show is getting btw. (Although I also liked the sub-titled historical intro (set in China, circa 1977), that featured an excellent actress who portrays the tortured young Dr. Ye. Meanwhile in contrast to this poignant and serious portrayal of an enslaved physicist who betrays humanity, are the two irritating ""western"" female scientists, Jin and Auggie, who seem to have been cast for their ability to maintain sex appeal even while grimacing or in a state of shock. (Question: Does how good female physicists look in tight jeans impress particle accelerators?) And one other question: how does Dr. Salazar, who is nearly going blind/ being driven insane by flashing numbers scrawled across her vision, manage to apply mascara and eyeliner so perfectly? I got used to this distracting supermodel Einstein schtick after a while, but sheesh, It's just so ludicrous. Btw, I've now watched half of the ""unflashy"" Chinese 30 episode version called ""3 body"" and it's dramatically superior. At least it never reeks of glammed-up sci-fi soap opera like this Neflix version does. Although admiitedly, the final scene was pretty OK."	series cgi definitely stunner series whole could easier like actually sympathetic lead character mix watch episode watch perhaps full episode worth hype show get btw although also like sub title historical intro set china circa feature excellent actress portray torture young dr ye meanwhile contrast poignant serious portrayal enslave physicist betray humanity two irritate western female scientist jin auggie seem cast ability maintain sex appeal even grimace state shock question good female physicist look tight jean impress particle accelerator one question dr salazar nearly go blind drive insane flash number scrawl across vision manage apply mascara eyeliner perfectly get use distract supermodel einstein schtick sheesh ludicrous btw watch half unflashy chinese episode version call body dramatically superior least never reek glamme sci fi soap opera like neflix version although admiitedly final scene pretty ok
1	"I've only played Fallout 4, so I am not a fanboy of the game from the first release like so many people are. Still, the series did not disappoint. The first thing I thought when I saw this was the Art Director deserves an Emmy. The place looks exactly like the video game. The cities, the towns, the abandoned buildings are right out of the video game. The Art Director did a masterful job in creating a wasteland of destroyed cities.Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins were terrific. The reason I didn't give the series an 8 or 9 star review is because of one character, Maximus/Titus. I didn't like his storyline, and I especially didn't like the actor, I thought he was terrible. He always has this forlorn, sad look on his face, and he always whined. I just didn't like him at all especially the attempts at humor. Goggins on the other hand was terrific as usual.For those who don't know about the game, we are in a ""Mad Max"" type environment after a nuclear war has almost completely destroyed civilization. We have people living in underground vaults hoping to repopulate the Earth one day after whatever is left on the surface has died. But the surface dwellers aren't too keen on dying out just yet. We have various factions of all the different groups and of course radioactive monsters. The story is done bascially in two different perspectives. We experience the present while remembering the past and how the world got where it is today. It tells how and why the vaults were built and how we came to war. Accompanying our protaganists is a sound track made up of mostly 1940s and 1950s songs. It's fine for a while but they overdo it a bit.All in all, I think this was a very good series and I can envision at least 3 more seasons. I highly recommend this series."	play fallout fanboy game first release like many people still series disappoint first thing think see art director deserve emmy place look exactly like video game city town abandon build right video game art director masterful job create wasteland destroy city ella purnell walton goggin terrific reason give series star review one character maximus titus like storyline especially like actor think terrible always forlorn sad look face always whine like especially attempt humor goggin hand terrific usual know game mad max type environment nuclear war almost completely destroy civilization people live underground vault hop repopulate earth one day whatever leave surface die surface dweller keen die yet various faction different group course radioactive monster story do bascially two different perspective experience present remember past world get today tell vault build come war accompany protaganist sound track make mostly song fine overdo bite think good series envision least season highly recommend series
1	It's not bad if you turn your brain off and just have it on in the background. The most annoying thing is no one could hit what they were aiming at if their life depended on it... which within the story it often is. My 8 year old can hit a target at a greater range while under intense nerf gun fire 😂 but seriously if real cops found themselves needing to fire their weapon as often as this lot with such poor accuracy they would all be dead.There is also a lot of pausing and hesitation to let people get away so the episode isn't over in two minutes.Having said all that it is quite addictive and easy binge watching.	bad turn brain background annoy thing one could hit aim life depend within story often year old hit target great range intense nerf gun fire seriously real cop find need fire weapon often lot poor accuracy would dead also lot pause hesitation let people get away episode two minute say quite addictive easy binge watch

1	"Yes I read the books, no I don't care that they changed things. It's simply not a good show.This was created by David Benioff and DB Weiss, the two who created 4 of the greatest seasons of television and 2 of the worst (Game of Thrones). I didn't know they were in charge until a few episodes in and it really made sense once I found out. In an interview about SE6 of GoT Weiss said that he fought tooth and nail to add a pointless zombie bear scene saying ""Damn it, I want a god-damn zombie bear!"" He'd fought for several seasons until he was finally greenlit to add it. Why? Because he thought it was cool. No other reason.It very much shows that the two couldn't help themselves yet again when creating this show. The books have plenty of concrete and fascinating imagery that, to the shows credit, translate very well to the screen. However, so much of the added material is just bad and weighs down the fascinating ideas in the books.Very very minor spoilers, it's not enough that in one scene everything starts to get destroyed, but then a little girl riding a literal flaming horse bursts through a window with CGI lava pouring in behind her screaming ""save meee aaahhhh"" which genuinely made me laugh at how bad it was. It's so over the top. Of course that's the scene where my wife walks in and just laughs asking me what the hell I'm watching and it's legitimately embarrassing seeing the absolutely cringe on display.Not everything is the show's fault, like the katana lady who was edgy and cringe even in the books, and some of the show works like the stunning visuals, but I guess the show's worst enemies were the ones who tried to make this in the first place. You need a mature team to make this series work and we got two hacks most famous for drilling a celebrated series into the dirt. Who could have seen this coming...It's simply messy, adding aspects to the story to make it more interesting and cool when the (first two) books are already just that. You can change things, I don't mind, but just keep them consistent within the world you're displaying."	yes read book care change thing simply good show create david benioff db weiss two create great season television bad game throne know charge episode really make sense find interview se get weiss say fight tooth nail add pointless zombie bear scene say damn want god damn zombie bear fight several season finally greenlit add think cool reason much show two help yet create show book plenty concrete fascinate imagery show credit translate well screen however much add material bad weigh fascinate idea book minor spoiler enough one scene everything start get destroy little girl rid literal flame horse burst window cgi lava pour behind scream save meee aaahhhh genuinely make laugh bad top course scene wife walk laugh ask hell watch legitimately embarrass see absolutely cringe display everything show fault like katana lady edgy cringe even book show work like stun visual guess show bad enemy one try make first place need mature team make series work get two hack famous drill celebrate series dirt could see come simply messy add aspect story make interest cool first two book already change thing mind keep consistent within world display

1	Have been a big fan of the show since series 1 and now at series 13, I've actually lost interest. The first 10 series were hard to not binge watch - although this is a medical drama it's the characters that made me continue to watch more. However, the characters have now lost their depth and the story lines are becoming dull and strung out. Since the death of one of the main characters in series 11 it feels as though Shonda should have left us all to wonder what happened in the wake of it, not actually tried to show us. I won't be tuning in to series 14.	big fan show since series series actually lose interest first series hard binge watch although medical drama character make continue watch however character lose depth story line become dull string since death one main character series feel though shonda leave we wonder happen wake actually try show we tune series

1	"Let's start with the fact that those who were expecting a dark, melancholic drama with complex philosophical explorations in the spirit of ""The Book of Eli"" (2010) or the opposite, full of killer action in the form of ""Doomsday"" (2008), will be disappointed. Fans of art house and ""Six-String Samurai"" (1998) are also unlikely will like the adaptation. Amazon's Fallout, although it has a little bit of everything in it, ultimately remains a predominantly evil satire with elements of fan service, taking the ideological and conceptual basis of the controversial fourth part of the game series.The shelters are safe, but the wasteland is lifeless only at first glance. Monsters come not only in the form of cockroaches, water creatures, but also people. Consumerism of the fifties played a cruel joke on its ideological inspirers. The authors quickly go over the top, paying a lot of attention to small details, references and key elements, some of which, however, will only be understandable to hardcore fans of the genre. A scene later they joke about the fact that the ""Brotherhood of Steel"" uses old technologies to collect technologies, while simultaneously sarcastically noting that there is no practical use for a toaster found in a scorched desert. They immediately switch to the next segment, without really plunging into the context. This approach is reflected in its own way on the main characters:A shelter resident raised on high ideals is forced by circumstances to go to the surface and face harsh reality.A boy who miraculously survived, tormented by moral dilemmas, builds his career in the ""Brotherhood of Steel"".Ghoul cowboy. An ambiguous character with a partially vague past, whose image and behavior, adjusted for local realities, are almost completely copied from the ""Man in Black"" from ""Westworld"" (2016-2022).At first all three will be united by the search for a certain object that can change the fate of the entire surrounding surviving world. Along the way, the main story arc, as usual in an ""RPG with Action elements"", is diluted with several side stories of varying degrees of interest.During flashbacks, when one of the characters indulges in rhetorical reasoning, a third kind character interrupts him with an apt thought - they are all just a product for later consumption, so it's time to forget about art and any meaningful depth in a world ruled by corporations and a joyful consumer culture. What serves as a small plot digression is equally applicable as a verdict on the first season. The film adaptation is not bad in its own way, but at the same time, it's required to understand its specifics and what lies at its core, so as not to expect from it what it is not."	let start fact expect dark melancholic drama complex philosophical exploration spirit book eli opposite full killer action form doomsday disappoint fan art house six string samurai also unlikely like adaptation amazon fallout although little bite everything ultimately remain predominantly evil satire element fan service take ideological conceptual basis controversial fourth part game series shelter safe wasteland lifeless first glance monster come form cockroache water creature also people consumerism fifty play cruel joke ideological inspirer author quickly go top pay lot attention small detail reference key element however understandable hardcore fan genre scene later joke fact brotherhood steel use old technology collect technology simultaneously sarcastically note practical use toaster find scorch desert immediately switch next segment without really plunge context approach reflect way main character shelter resident raise high ideal force circumstance go surface face harsh reality boy miraculously survive torment moral dilemma build career brotherhood steel ghoul cowboy ambiguous character partially vague past whose image behavior adjust local reality almost completely copy man black westworld first three unite search certain object change fate entire surround survive world along way main story arc usual rpg action element dilute several side story vary degree interest flashback one character indulge rhetorical reason third kind character interrupt apt think product later consumption time forget art meaningful depth world rule corporation joyful consumer culture serve small plot digression equally applicable verdict first season film adaptation bad way time require understand specific lie core expect

2	Translating the series to screen was a difficult task, but the show is faithful to the events of the books while making appropriate modifications to fit the medium.The primary protagonists are now contemporaries and friends in an interwoven plot line. We see great progress in telling the stories of Ye Wenjie, the Three-Body game, the staircase project, and the introduction of wallfacers and hibernation.Many other modifications are very sensible - Ye's principles of cosmic sociology have been replaced with metaphor. The game narrator / sophons are personified. The legacy of the ETO is embodied by original character Tatiana, enabling behavior motivations distinct from Ye and Evans.Alas, the best remains ahead, as the series proceeds into the terrors of The Dark Forest, and the bizarre reaches imagined in Death's End. We can only hope Netflix continues their investment for one more season to ensure we get to see it.	translate series screen difficult task show faithful event book make appropriate modification fit medium primary protagonist contemporary friend interweave plot line see great progress tell story ye wenjie three body game staircase project introduction wallfacer hibernation many modification sensible ye principle cosmic sociology replace metaphor game narrator sophon personify legacy eto embody original character tatiana enable behavior motivation distinct ye evans alas good remain ahead series proceed terror dark forest bizarre reach imagine death end hope netflix continue investment one season ensure get see
0	Too much bad acting. Way to much music in almost every scene. A messy plot. Not enough action. Monsters that are not nearly as dangerous as in the games, and are killed easily. For instance a gulper that is simply killed by dragging a man out of its mouth. I didn't really understand how that was possible at all to kill a big scary monster like that. The main characters do a decent job trying to make the series interesting, but many of the other characters are simply bad actors. A lot of scenes are confusing and a lot of questions about why the characters do what they do or say what they say are left unanswered. The good thing about the whole thing is the visuals and the environment, that is very true to the game series. But that's about it. Maybe I expected too much. But it felt like a less than mediocre Nuka cola.	much bad act way much music almost every scene messy plot enough action monster nearly dangerous game kill easily instance gulper simply kill drag man mouth really understand possible kill big scary monster like main character decent job try make series interest many character simply bad actor lot scene confuse lot question character say say leave unanswered good thing whole thing visual environment true game series maybe expect much feel like less mediocre nuka cola

The actor, writer, director Richard Gadd has outdone himself in this one and the story being a real story of his own life, brings another spark in the show. All the performances were extremely brilliant and the cinematography will take your heart away. Somehow, you will understand what goes through the head of a person who went through trauma and here is where the writer and actor wins. It is a must watch. The ending will leave you in splits, but will make you think, and maybe that is what the writer wanted to do after all.

They keep saying how much it looks like the game and how it's artistically accurate. But is that it? Shouldn't things happen clearly when you turn a game into a series or movie. A reviewer said it's more fun to watch someone play the game than watch this. I completely agree. I watched the first episode and didn't feel like watching the second. I started the second episode and waited, bored until 2 thirds into it before something happened. We don't get time to know the main characters and they just wander around saying lame dialogs. One cannot even compare this to the Last of Us series which has humor, action and characters you care about and really good script. Fallout tried to include cameos by familiar faces to make up for how lame this show is but even Walton Goggin or Michael Rapaport can't save this. Watch Walton Goggin in Justified where he's given a good script and be amazed. As for this Fallout... i mean Strikeout I'm done with it.

1	"For once more, the fabulous D & D duet take certain liberties in their adaption of a renowned literary accomplishment, and if you take in account how things ended with Game of Thrones, then you shouldn't be overtly optimistic for the outcome of this one.I wasn't a big fan of the first two books -my mind changed with the third which I'm currently reading. I'm not sure if it was the translation or the writing style, I struggled to finish the first-the second was slightly better. I'm not a big fan of hard science. I always felt that Arthur Clarke did the same thing in a better manner in Childhood's End.The Netflix show polishes the rough edges and simplifies the whole thing, adding lots of gory scenes to make the show appeal to a younger and less sophisticated audience. Not necessarily a bad thing if you want to target the average viewer rather than the hardcore science fiction fans of the original trilogy.The Netflix show feels very rushed, by the time you reach episode six you're already in the third book, but hey, these are the guys who adapted Game of Thrones, so no suprise there.There is lots of visual excitement, but lots of scenes, such as the destruction of the ship and its passenger, feel like they belong to another film. The characters are also kinda lame. The ""Oxford 5"" were a bad idea better suited for the Final Destination franchise.After I finished the Netflix show, I started watching the Chinese version and I couldn't believe my eyes. Science fiction done on a level that has never been done before, with an amazing visual style much better than any Netflix or HBO show.

That is not something to be found here in this show, it's all because of the pacing, everything is raging forward, and the big ideas just flows out like the rest of the story, nothing special, nothing epic. I cannot speak for those who have never read the book before, but I doubt people can really catch the essence of those big ideas. It has nothing to do with casting, recreating or anything, I'm not criticizing those.And if you find the characters in the original book are flat enough, somehow David & Dan find a way to make characters in this show even more flat, more flat than those dehydrated Trisolarans. By the way they call them Santi now which is probably the only thing loyal to the original novel. That is the price of building 5 (or 4, or more than 5, who cares) protagonists at the same time in a show less than 9 hours. The good thing is the way they rearranged the story line did left plenty of space for the protagonists to grow in future seasons. Let's just hope the crew use this to their advantage in the next few seasons.Everything else is just a typical Netflix show, industry standard production, industry standard cinema, industry standard everything. For that it deserves a solid 7/10. It's a good show, and if you are not familiar with the original you might find some parts quite intriguing, first few episodes might be bit slow if you don't have any idea where the plot is heading but get better after ep3. It is what it is, it's a TV show detouring from the book and ,at least the first season, isn't your typical epic Sci-fi. It tries to please everyone but hardly satisfies anyone. Hope to see how things develop next season.	something reader original novel know carefully cixin liu plant every detail slowly guide plot trap boom crazy idea magnificent scene show blow away something find show pace everything rag forward big idea flow like rest story nothing special nothing epic speak never read book doubt people really catch essence big idea nothing cast recreate anything criticize find character original book flat enough somehow david dan find way make character show even flat flat dehydrate trisolaran way call santi probably thing loyal original novel price build care protagonist time show less hour good thing way rearrange story line leave plenty space protagonist grow future season let hope crew use advantage next season everything else typical netflix show industry standard production industry standard cinema industry standard everything deserve solid good show familiar original might find part quite intrigue first episode might bite slow idea plot head get well ep tv show detour book least first season typical epic sci fi try please everyone hardly satisfy anyone hope see thing develop next season
2	I didn't play the Fallout game (although I briefly played the mini game on my phone) and I'm so excited for this show! My husband and I binged the entire season this weekend and I'm so sad it ended. I do love anything in the post apocalyptic style / dystopian thrillers and this show is it! The acting is top notch, interesting/unique storyline, and the sets & costumes are great. I think this has the potential to be a HUGE hit. It makes me want to start Halo now. As a non video gamer, these shows plus Last of Us are hits even amongst the non gamer. I'm super looking forward to the next season...I could see so many ways the show could possibly go. I can't wait for more!!	play fallout game although briefly play mini game phone excite show husband binge entire season weekend sad end love anything post apocalyptic style dystopian thriller show act top notch interest unique storyline set costume great think potential huge hit make want start halo non video gamer show plus last we hit even amongst non gamer super look forward next season could see many way show could possibly go wait
0	Too childish & weird for me. No real storyline. Great acting. Great actors. Excellent production. But a meaningless story. Took 3 episodes to get a brief glimpse of where it's going. Nowhere. I won't be watching more.I've never been into computer games. This one is very annoying.Many other fantasy movies have strong storylines. This one doesn't.What starts out as intriguing with dying scientists and police investigating it soon turns into weird stuff with new age game headsets and fantasy scripts.I'm.guessing the script is AI generated as it's quite solid.sentences but nonsensical.. Lots of buzzwords but no depth or continuity.	childish weird real storyline great act great actor excellent production meaningless story take episode get brief glimpse go nowhere watch never computer game one annoy many fantasy movie strong storyline one start intrigue die scientist police investigate soon turn weird stuff new age game headset fantasy script guess script ai generate quite solid sentence nonsensical lot buzzwords depth continuity
2	Originally, I thought it was that detective show with Adrian Dunbar making a welcome return then realised that was Ridley!Despite not leaving my settee for 7 hours after a bingewatch of this, I am worn out from watching them walking up and down all those steps (it was a relief when they fixed the lift).I was apprehensive when I realised it wasn't in colour (I am sure the Italian tourist board is too!) but, let's just say, like the old Guinness adverts did; not everything in black and white makes sense!I have never seen the previous versions so can't compare them.I vaguely recognised Andrew Scott from a few British shows (plus 1917) and John Malkovich turns up to do a couple of cameo scenes. Knowing so few of the actors allowed me to concentrate on the storyline but there didn't seem to be much of one to be put off by (Skip episodes 3-6 and you won't miss much!).I loved the camera angles and Lucio stole the show with his stares (his paw marks on the stairs bring some brief colour to it all!).10 for directing and cinematography.8 for the acting 5 for the number of episodes you can skip.	originally think detective show adrian dunbar make welcome return realise ridley despite leave settee hour bingewatch wear watch walk step relief fix lift apprehensive realise colour sure italian tourist board let say like old guinness advert everything black white make sense never see previous version compare vaguely recognise andrew scott british show plus john malkovich turn couple cameo scene know actor allow concentrate storyline seem much one put skip episode miss much love camera angle lucio steal show star paw mark stair bring brief colour direct cinematography act number episode skip

0	Like many shows that Amazon has done in recent years, all our fears about how bad this show might be has come true. They made a show for people that have never played the game. It's not as bad as I was expecting which is why I gave it a higher rating however if you are a big fan of the franchise, you're likely to be as disappointed as we all thought we would be. Oxhorn explained it right in his review of the trailer. It's better than the abomination they created in the wheel of time but not quite as entertaining as the halo series which fans hated. If you've never played thw game then I'm sure you'll enjoy this show since it was made for the non fans yet again, for some weird reason.	like many show amazon do recent year fear bad show might come true make show people never play game bad expect give high rat however big fan franchise likely disappoint think would oxhorn explain right review trailer well abomination create wheel time quite entertain halo series fan hat never play thw game sure enjoy show since make non fan yet weird reason
2	Sure the black and white looks nice and chic and all. But there should be a universal law that says you have to show color when filming in Italy. Italy, in the 1960s, the Amalfi Coast, and you chose to not show colors? I am secretly waiting for the director to see that this was a huge mistake, and for him to re-release a version in color, and I can't wait to watch that. The characters behave somewhat strange sometimes. Dickie and Marge are so cold, distant, suspicious, yet at the same time overly welcoming when there's no need to. And Tom is just too creepy all the time than what anyone would deal with or take serious in real life. Why would Dicke askTom to stay with him if they show no signs of a developing friendship or that they even like each other? However, it's still the talented Mr. Ripley, nearly 8 hours of it. Bravo for making a remake, 9 stars for that. If they have shown Italy in color, it would have been 10 stars regardless of the weird parts, it's still highly enjoyable!	sure black white look nice chic universal law say show color film italy italy amalfi coast choose show color secretly wait director see huge mistake release version color wait watch character behave somewhat strange sometimes dickie marge cold distant suspicious yet time overly welcome need tom creepy time anyone would deal take serious real life would dicke asktom stay show sign develop friendship even like however still talente mr ripley nearly hour bravo make remake star show italy color would star regardless weird part still highly enjoyable
1	"...... I'll get to the ""but"" in a minute.Superbly cinematic and expertly filmed, Ripley gets the period, vibe, sets and props spot on. Ripley does not appear to have spared any expertise or expense in getting things right.The cast, with one glaring exception, is exceptional. The exception is Andrew Scott. I adore him in most everything else he has done, but he should have turned down - nay, run away from - this role. He is far too old to play Tom Ripley; in fact, he is more than twice the age of Ripley and no amount of makeup or tape can hide the actor's age. Pity, as Scott acts the role well, but his effort, indeed, the entire series, is spoiled due to the incredulity of a 47 year-old playing a ~25 year old."	get minute superbly cinematic expertly film ripley get period vibe set prop spot ripley appear spar expertise expense get thing right cast one glare exception exceptional exception andrew scott adore everything else do turn nay run away role far old play tom ripley fact twice age ripley amount makeup tape hide actor age pity scott act role well effort indeed entire series spoil due incredulity year old play year old
1	For a start Andrew Scott is 48 years old and looks it, so the persona of the young drifter doesn't fit. Next, not just his deliberately slow dialogue but all the casts methodical serious approach to everything becomes a drag.Add to this this monochrome colouring and the series fails to deliver much punch, surprise or atmosphere apart from dreariness, Ripley is more of a depressed desperate loser than a crafty conman and opportunist.They've put effort and thought Into the production but they have over done the styling, it drowns out the intrigue and fun the story.So an average show, that could have been better.Dakota Fanning's character is so deadpan she flattens most scenes she is in, the beauty and sparkle of Naples is totally lost, the lightness and purity that Gwyneth Paltrow once gave this role, made the character far more appealing.So I'm being generous with a 5, it's mainly for effort, they tried hard but failed.	start andrew scott year old look persona young drifter fit next deliberately slow dialogue cast methodical serious approach everything become drag add monochrome colour series fail deliver much punch surprise atmosphere apart dreariness ripley depress desperate loser crafty conman opportunist put effort think production do style drown intrigue fun story average show could better dakota fan character deadpan flatten scene beauty sparkle naples totally lose lightness purity gwyneth paltrow give role make character far appeal generous mainly effort try hard fail

2	This dark and powerful true story is a complicated thriller that ultimately examines male abuse victims through an angle rarely seen or spoken of. Painfully honest and brutally paced to throttle the viewer into the personal and multi layered world of the main character this incredibly well acted dramedy is complex, beautiful and one of the best and most important shows in recent years.Richard Gadd whose personal real life experiences is the backbone of this haunting story relives painful moments of his own ordeal as Donny with incredible honesty and bravery while taking full control over his own story. Jessica Gunning, as Martha, Donny's stalker, delivers a fiery and physical performance so unhinged and raw, the like of which has not been seen since Kathy Bates in Misery. Her ability to bring both red hot fury and dignity to a character with few redeeming qualities brings some much needed moments of dark humor to this otherwise serious story.Unabashed and ever present until the very end Jennifer Gunning's, Martha is the backbone of Reindeer Baby. Nava Mau, who plays Teri, Donny's beautiful and loving on again off again fling brings tremendous levity and much needed charisma to the show. And while Teri is trans (as is the actress who portrays her) and Teri's trans identity plays a central role and an ongoing theme in the story, Nava Mau fully transcends this part of the characters identity allowing us to get a deep dive into Teri's toxic attraction to Donny and his many red flags.The effects of toxic masculinity and homophobia and transphobia on men and how that particularly impacts male abuse victims has rarely been portrayed so masterfully and personally for wide audiences before. And judging by its global success Reindeer Baby's themes have never been more important than now.	dark powerful true story complicate thriller ultimately examine male abuse victim angle rarely see speak painfully honest brutally pace throttle view personal multi layer world main character incredibly well act dramedy complex beautiful one good important show recent year richard gadd whose personal real life experience backbone haunt story relive painful moment ordeal donny incredible honesty bravery take full control story jessica gun martha donny stalker deliver fiery physical performance unhinge raw like see since kathy bat misery ability bring red hot fury dignity character redeem quality bring much need moment dark humor otherwise serious story unabashe ever present end jennifer gun martha backbone reindeer baby nava mau play teri donny beautiful love fling bring tremendous levity much need charisma show teri trans actress portray teri trans identity play central role ongoing theme story nava mau fully transcend part character identity allow we get deep dive teri toxic attraction donny many red flag effect toxic masculinity homophobia transphobia man particularly impact male abuse victim rarely portray masterfully personally wide audience judge global success reindeer baby theme never important

0	...a Nolan was responsible for this disjointed mess.The characters are unbelievable, unlikable, and uninteresting almost entirely due to the storytelling jumping around so much and leaving out enormous chunks of their lives. Why, with eight hours or so of time, afe so many characters so underdeveloped? Why is so much of the so-called Wasteland in relatively good upkeep after so many years exposed to the elements and no one to maintain any of it?Many sequences are painfully long, and do nothing to enhance the story. Many sequences are introduced and over so quickly one wonders why they even bothered.It's painful to watch.	nolan responsible disjoint mess character unbelievable unlikable uninteresting almost entirely due storytelling jump around much leave enormous chunk live eight hour time afe many character underdevelop much call wasteland relatively good upkeep many year expose element one maintain many sequence painfully long nothing enhance story many sequence introduce quickly one wonder even bother painful watch
1	"I now watched 4 complete seasons of Grey's anatomy. And don't get me wrong, I like most of it. I liked SCRUBS better, I liked HOUSE better, but this series is, regarding content and character development, definitely the other one in my top 3 of medical TV series, and overall still in the top 10 even if it is place 9 or 10. But during season 4 I began to feel uncomfortable with the character of Meredith Grey, played by Ellen Pompeo. Well, played .... in literally every scene be it funny, sad, reflective, miss Pompeo fails to bring any emotional content to the screen. Her face is that of a jaded stuck up arrogant b**** if it is not expressionless at all. No matter what facial expression you might expect from an actor in any given circumstance and no matter how hard her colleagues try to save a scene: with her in it staring at them like they are not there, Ellen Pompeo is ruining this series. If you tell me that she had some facial operation that went terribly wrong I would believe it. It becomes harder and harder to watch and is putting me off the series. I guess the producers had no choice to keep her on as lead ""actress"" since the series is a hit, but in my opinion that is in no way tied to the non-existing efforts of Ellen Pompeo."	watch complete season grey anatomy get wrong like like scrub well like house well series regard content character development definitely one top medical tv series overall still top even place season begin feel uncomfortable character meredith grey play ellen pompeo well play literally every scene funny sad reflective miss pompeo fail bring emotional content screen face jade stick arrogant b expressionless matter facial expression might expect actor give circumstance matter hard colleague try save scene star like ellen pompeo ruin series tell facial operation go terribly wrong would believe become hard hard watch put series guess producer choice keep lead actress since series hit opinion way tie non exist effort ellen pompeo
2	A brilliant production. Andrew Scott is amazing, sweet and sinister all at once. Complex and shallow at the same time - you just never know....... The cinematography is astounding, breathtaking at points. Some scenes look like a piece of art. Italy is portrayed like another character in the series.I would have given this 10/10 but for the weird anachronistic Freddie character. I couldn't wait for him to be gone.Scott eats up the screen, I can't wait to see what's next for him. No one else gets a chance with Ripley, you think he's one thing, they think they've gotten the better of him because of their status/wealth. But he outsmarts them, on occasionally to their peril. And I'm glad of it.	brilliant production andrew scott amaze sweet sinister complex shallow time never know cinematography astound breathtaking point scene look like piece art italy portray like another character series would give weird anachronistic freddie character wait go scott eat screen wait see next one else get chance ripley think one thing think get well status wealth outsmart occasionally peril glad

Can't tell whether it's bad acting or bad direction maybe both but it's all just awful.	get one episode open sequence china pretty good draw introduce main character cleverest scientist western world top profession unfortunately badly cast dialogue akin university first year seriously terrible dialogue way make character believable diversity cast great dialogue characterisation production work diversity make one seem like real person top scientific community tell whether bad act bad direction maybe awful
2	I'm a huge fan of the games. I played Fallout 1 & 2 in the 90s, and Fallout 3, New Vegas and 4 later on (New Vegas is my favorite, but I love them all, yes even 4). I only briefly played Tactics and never tried 76.Anyway, this show is actually way better than I expected! It absolutely nails the tone of the games. The production design is fantastic. Some of the actual filmmaking is a little mixed, with a few scenes struggling when it comes to basic blocking and framing, but overall this is top tier work with a great cast. Walton Goggins is a standout, this is one of his best roles. There's some really nice character writing, too, and actual character growth.I know there's been some controversy with the changes made to the lore, especially in the last episode, but I actually think they handled it well, making the revelations near the end a satisfying character moment with some real emotional stakes to it. This isn't a perfect show, of course, but there's wayyyy more to like than not like, and as a fan of the games, I'm genuinely surprised how well this turned out. The production values are decent, the character writing and casting is great, and the tone is spot on; that's all I can ever ask for from an adaptation (or continuation) of something I love.Would love to see games like BioShock, Mass Effect, Deus Ex, Dishonored and Half-Life get the same sort of treatment.	huge fan game play fallout fallout new vegas later new vegas favorite love yes even briefly play tactic never try anyway show actually way well expect absolutely nail tone game production design fantastic actual filmmake little mix scene struggle come basic block frame overall top tier work great cast walton goggin standout one good role really nice character write actual character growth know controversy change make lore especially last episode actually think handle well make revelation near end satisfy character moment real emotional stake perfect show course wayyyy like like fan game genuinely surprise well turn production value decent character write cast great tone spot ever ask adaptation continuation something love would love see game like bioshock mass effect deus ex dishonor half life get sort treatment

If the trenches weren't alight, Dothraki swords ablaze, or dragon fire being spewed I literally couldn't tell wtf was going on.

1	I enjoyed this overall, liked the cast, the acting, visuals abit questionable sometimes (blob covering the earth) but generally pretty good. It's just the story I found it hard to take seriously, both the ai's strategy and the humans strategy make zero sense. Ai coming to attack us gave us a 400 year warning, told us all their plans and attempts to wipe out science otherwise we win? Why not just stop the ships?The humans strategy is even more insane. To send basically a living human brain with no body that gets propelled through space by 1,000 nuclear bombs that each have extreme room for failure as it all needs to be lined up like threading a needle? How is that a viable option? How are effectively 2 people on the planet coming up with this mental strategy, is there nobody else? We can propel a probe at 1% the speed of light, technically right now in real life, its called project starshot and it shoots lasers at a 1 gram craft propelling it to insane speeds. But the idea of riding a brain on the waves of 1000 nuclear bombs is the one that wins?Not only that, but the 2 people in charge of this absolute mess are about to time travel (cryo) to the future to make sure this insane plan works. That's the best earth could come up with? I'm ashamed and we deserve to be wiped out. Why not send probes travelling at 1% lightspeed as kinetic nukes at the fleet or basically anything other than the current plan.	enjoy overall like cast act visual abit questionable sometimes blob cover earth generally pretty good story find hard take seriously ai strategy human strategy make zero sense ai come attack we give we year warn tell we plan attempt wipe science otherwise win stop ship human strategy even insane send basically live human brain body get propel space nuclear bomb extreme room failure need line like thread needle viable option effectively people planet come mental strategy nobody else propel probe speed light technically right real life call project starshot shoot laser gram craft propel insane speed idea rid brain wave nuclear bomb one win people charge absolute mess time travel cryo future make sure insane plan work good earth could come ashamed deserve wipe send probe travel lightspeed kinetic nuke fleet basically anything current plan

1	"This latest in a recent trend of videogame adaptations is lacking the edge and wit of the Fallout titles.Bethesda's famous IP could work on the small screen; but the ""how"" is something I feel is still, as of yet, unanswered. Porting a videogame to a TV show takes work because those are two very different mediums with different aims. Splitting the story between three characters isn't necessarily a bad idea (GoT did brilliantly on multiple subplots) but it can be hard to properly pull off. The sprightly Ella Purnell as the vault-dweller female protagonist Lucy MacLean has a face that fits the brand and a geniality and greenness to match, but is just missing something.The through-line and recycled ""brand"" is shaky, and I feel the show is unsure of its desired identity (at the moment). Original Fallout is hilariously unhinged, comical, with dark humour that simply flows between scenarios - across the different factions it challenges notions of conventional ethics and philosophies too, so there's always food for thought. But the challenge for the writers here is to find a story that can work cohesively on TV that feels like Fallout but takes it in the new direction of a plot-driven live action production.The dialogue in the games is outstanding and engaging, but here it's merely okay. Every word should entertain, develop, or expand. But I can't say that here it really does. We get a lot of camera panning into facial expressions and filler speech; but not enough meat and potatoes.The story lacks suitable structure. It feels too ""sandbox"" without enough linearity and purposeful direction. Where's the show going? What does the viewer have to look forward to? Where are the cliffhangers? On many occasions the show is absorbed in the scene of the moment and forgets about introducing the next chapter, the fluidity is missing. Where are the characters' driving motivations? Are the characters investable... or just expendable? The producers perhaps assume that the strength of the Fallout brand can compensate for mediocre writing. It doesn't."	late recent trend videogame adaptation lack edge wit fallout title bethesda famous ip could work small screen something feel still yet unanswered port videogame tv show take work two different medium different aim split story three character necessarily bad idea get brilliantly multiple subplot hard properly pull sprightly ella purnell vault dweller female protagonist lucy maclean face fit brand geniality greenness match miss something line recycle brand shaky feel show unsure desire identity moment original fallout hilariously unhinge comical dark humour simply flow scenario across different faction challenge notion conventional ethic philosophy always food think challenge writer find story work cohesively tv feel like fallout take new direction plot drive live action production dialogue game outstanding engage merely okay every word entertain develop expand say really get lot camera pan facial expression filler speech enough meat potato story lack suitable structure feel sandbox without enough linearity purposeful direction show go viewer look forward cliffhanger many occasion show absorb scene moment forget introduce next chapter fluidity miss character drive motivation character investable expendable producer perhaps assume strength fallout brand compensate mediocre write

But then all of them left, like after that it became a drag, i mean i still like the show, but LOVE, no not like in the beginning.

0	"I have not read the books but I have heard for years about this great series. I was cautiously optimistic when I heard about Benioff & Weiss doing the adaptation for Netflix because they would have a completed work to adapt. They did a wonderful job on GOT until they ran out of Martin's source material. If these books were as good as they are said to be, there must have been a lot changed or lost in bringing it to Netflix.The first episode really drew me in. The scenes in China were great and a wonderful setup. I was anxious to see more. Then we meet the main characters (I agree with another reviewer's description of them as UK version of Friends). They do not in any way seem to act like scientists. But then this ""science fiction"" story seems to try and eliminate any vestige of real science. We are told that the world's super colliders are producing impossible results and that science is broken, but we are given not the slightest clue as to what those results might be. I guess we, the audience, are too stupid to understand. The list of unexplained illogic goes on. Why is Evans reading fairy tales to the aliens? Why is the nano fence a better way of destroying the ship than a bomb ? Why do the all powerful aliens need to recruit a cult on earth? And above all, we are really shooting a brain into space to meet and hopefully infiltrate the aliens? When this was brought up my first thought was that sixties classic ""They Saved Hitler's Brain"".There is more to telling a story than filming a series of scenes! There is a rushed feeling of this happened and then this happened and then this ...

However, some of the plots just go on and on, episode after episode, when you just want them to move on. The ridiculous Denny plot, just for one. The 'ghost' storyline was ridiculous and stupid, and went on for sooo many episodes! I found myself skipping forward a lot just to get back to the normal parts of the show.Izzie is annoying, dramatic and selfish, but the other characters are better and more watchable.It is a good show, on the whole, and worth watching if you are undecided.	really enjoy watch show medical part fascinate storyline fine however plot go episode episode want move ridiculous denny plot one ghost storyline ridiculous stupid go sooo many episode find skip forward lot get back normal part show izzie annoy dramatic selfish character well watchable good show whole worth watch undecided
1	The whole series kinda takes its sweet time to get going. The first three episode, I find it they're a bit of a slog, I won't lie. But stick with it, trust me. I'm not usually a fan of shows that make you work for it, but in this case, it's worth the effort. The story starts picking up, and suddenly you're hooked, craving more details. But I gotta admit, the main characters felt kinda so-so. Like, they were okay, but nothing mind-blowing. Overall though, it's a solid watch.There is a good lesson for this series, our planet, the people and how we act on it. I have not read the book or watched some adaptation so I like the message.	whole series kinda take sweet time get go first three episode find bite slog lie stick trust usually fan show make work case worth effort story start pick suddenly hook crave detail get ta admit main character feel kinda like okay nothing mind blow overall though solid watch good lesson series planet people act read book watch adaptation like message

Obviously I'm assuming they were voted by people who never played the game... the wasteland is weak.. enclave is weak.. death claws are pretty cool I'll give them that.. but life in the wasteland doesn't translate from the game to the show at all ! I feel like if they were going to change so much they shouldn't have tried to follow the story line just make a new path! Instead of watching I would suggest just redownloading the game if you don't still have it and just replaying it because you will have a far better experience...

2	"Many people will criticize Martha because of her obsessed behaviors. It's true she needs a relationship. But In fact it's the trigger Donny's approach to her to get things gone crazy.I believe life always has two perspectives, one is a visible one and the other one is beyond earthly knowledge.In Muslim book Quran ( like the other God's book's) gave hints about those unearthly messages.

0	As a longtime fan of Fallout, this was a mere paintjob of Fallout over countless modern-day ideals that would not exist in such a world.If you were expecting something more like Waterworld or Mad Max, solid shows that understood grit in a harsh world from the turn of the century, you will be dissapointed.There are no physical requirements for the Brotherhood of Steel. They allow their initiates to have guts in a world of scarcity. Everything is the modern DEI buzz with a coat of paint over it, the bones and soul of this world is not Fallout, it's our world with a holographic overlay.I don't think writers can even imagine worlds unlike our own anymore, unlike the elite tech companies and creative bubbles of the east and west coast. Over 200 years of radiation, scarcity, military cult purity tests, ignorance, and loss...we are still in the modern day with modern messages only an inch beneath the shallow surface of this 'world'.	longtime fan fallout mere paintjob fallout countless modern day ideal would exist world expect something like waterworld mad max solid show understand grit harsh world turn century dissapointe physical requirement brotherhood steel allow initiate gut world scarcity everything modern dei buzz coat paint bone soul world fallout world holographic overlay think writer even imagine world unlike anymore unlike elite tech company creative bubble east west coast year radiation scarcity military cult purity test ignorance loss still modern day modern message inch beneath shallow surface world
1	Excruciatingly long, excruciatingly boring, what was going on??!!! The middle of the season was the only part that was semi-enjoyable but the rest was all over the place. There was so much going on, it was honestly annoying how fast and slow everything was. The 5 protagonists were also all over the place, how yall friends but none of yall know what's going on with each other. It just seemed like they over compensated by trying to overcomplicate and add unnecessary drama to the show. I will be extremely extremely shocked and confused if it got a season 2. I only finished because I really had to understand wtaf was going on.	excruciatingly long excruciatingly bore go middle season part semi enjoyable rest place much go honestly annoy fast slow everything protagonist also place you all friend none you all know go seem like compensate try overcomplicate add unnecessary drama show extremely extremely shock confuse get season finish really understand wtaf go
2	Ever since the show was announced I was waiting for it , I love Bethesda games, grew up playing Skyrim but never tried out a fallout , but man this show was amazing, from the start till the end tying all the plot and giving each and every character a purpose, it's a trio linear story which gets tied to each other with several twists and turns , GHOUL is the best , Lucy is amazing the actor who played Lucy perfectly executed the role. Lucy's reaction to several surface stuff which she's seeing for the first time gets her soo surprised yet she's eager to find her dad without giving up is great , and the development of a regular apprentice soldier to a sword , 2nd in command to a literal legion army a faction called brotherhood of steel , the twists and turns leading to a great finale which shows both the past and the present before the bomb dropped, fallout has done it , it could have had more content even tho it was already entertaining it just made me want more of that dystopian world , I started playing the games enjoying every bit waiting for a second season Cheers.	ever since show announce wait love bethesda game grow play skyrim never try fallout man show amaze start till end tie plot give every character purpose trio linear story get tie several twist turn ghoul good lucy amaze actor play lucy perfectly execute role lucy reaction several surface stuff see first time get soo surprise yet eager find dad without give great development regular apprentice soldier sword nd command literal legion army faction call brotherhood steel twist turn lead great finale show past present bomb drop fallout do could content even tho already entertain make want dystopian world start play game enjoy every bite wait second season cheer
1	At the time of this writing the show has a 7.9 rating. I suspect in time this will go down to around 7.2 although personally I think it deserves a 6.Too harsh? I don't think so. While I didn't hate the show and am not one of those people who need or expect all adaptations to adhere strictly to the source material I think if you are going to make changes in your adaptation they should make sense and make some sort of improvement. This show failed on both scores. The original books by author Cixin Liu were hard sci-fi and brilliant in scope and imagination. The adaptation dumbs down the source material for TV and makes changes to appease the political viewers. None of this is an improvement. All it achieves is it takes everything that made the books so different from everything else out there and turns it into the same kind of Hollywood tripe that's a dime a dozen these days.	time write show rat suspect time go around although personally think deserve harsh think hate show one people need expect adaptation adhere strictly source material think go make change adaptation make sense make sort improvement show fail score original book author cixin liu hard sci fi brilliant scope imagination adaptation dumb source material tv make change appease political viewer none improvement achieve take everything make book different everything else turn kind hollywood tripe dime dozen day
0	I'm quite surprised with the hype around this TV series. Underneath this historical / fantasy optics, paired with sensationalist portrayals like violence and sexualisation, there's not a lot of substance or consistency to the overall story. Just like the books.I didn't see any reason for the rape and sadistic scenes to add any realism when it's clear this is fantasy, there's dragons in it for crying out loud. If you like that kind of horror fantasy, maybe it's your thing.I don't think the quality of the visuals was very good either, it's filmed like those low budget history documentary reenactments, and you can tell the actors are wearing wigs etc.Some scenes dragged with the dialogues and I barely felt anything for the characters including the Starks. The various arcs of characters wasn't written with a complex or grand design, more like a soap opera of characters and groups coming and going.I barely made it to Season 5. I'm not surprised to hear fans disappointed with season 8, I hardly saw any clever plots to hold the story together in the first place.This really is for shock scenes and soap opera type entertainment, sprinkled with a bit of fantasy motif on the side. I don't know how well this will stand the test of time, if anything it could be something to watch just for laughs.	quite surprise hype around tv series underneath historical fantasy optic pair sensationalist portrayal like violence sexualisation lot substance consistency overall story like book see reason rape sadistic scene add realism clear fantasy dragon cry loud like kind horror fantasy maybe thing think quality visual good either film like low budget history documentary reenactment tell actor wear wig etc scene drag dialogue barely feel anything character include stark various arc character write complex grand design like soap opera character group come go barely make season surprise hear fan disappoint season hardly see clever plot hold story together first place really shock scene soap opera type entertainment sprinkle bite fantasy motif side know well stand test time anything could something watch laugh
1	Ripley is about a scoundrel New Yorker, down on his luck, who finds himself propelled into an adjacent look at Italian luxury via the father of an old acquaintance. Through various devious means the main character pursues that luxury for himself, only to set various chaotic events into motion. Can Ripley stay one step ahead of his own misdeeds?The easiest place to start with Ripley is it's look and feel established by black and white presentation. I'd go as far as saying it's a technical masterpiece. Every episode has an array of incredible shots in well lit/thought out locations. In my opinion the look of this show is easily the best part and the main reason I completed the season.The secondary reason was I thought this show was hilarious. The blundering nature of the main character is black comedy gold, and the scenes are very consistent in delivering that entertainment.Otherwise? I thought the show was OK at best. I love the main character as an actor, but I think part of the comedy is likely due to improper casting. I can't say bad casting, because Andrew Scott delivers a consistent performance that I really enjoyed. But some of the scenes are preposterous. These occasional scenes destroy any chance of me really taking Ripley seriously.It's also too long, and at times truly boring in terms of delivery of content. The visuals, really all technical qualities keep every moment afloat with merit, but patience is required to enjoy the slow paced approach.For me the slow pace is the double edged sword of this show. On one side it meanders between major events, but! When those events occur, Ripley really extends the duration of highly entertaining scenes in a satisfying way.	ripley scoundrel new yorker luck find propel adjacent look italian luxury via father old acquaintance various devious mean main character pursue luxury set various chaotic event motion ripley stay one step ahead misdeed easy place start ripley look feel establish black white presentation go far say technical masterpiece every episode array incredible shot well light think location opinion look show easily good part main reason complete season secondary reason think show hilarious blunder nature main character black comedy gold scene consistent deliver entertainment otherwise think show ok good love main character actor think part comedy likely due improper cast say bad cast andrew scott deliver consistent performance really enjoy scene preposterous occasional scene destroy chance really take ripley seriously also long time truly bear term delivery content visual really technical quality keep every moment afloat merit patience require enjoy slow pace approach slow pace double edge sword show one side meand major event event occur ripley really extend duration highly entertain scene satisfy way
0	As a final year med student about to be a neurosurgery intern in two months, I have spent several years in hospitals and several months as a subintern at major hospitals throughout the country. This is one of the most unrealistic medical shows I have ever seen. I'm sure it's fine as a drama or soap opera but don't expect any accurate depiction of what things are really like in surgery. Nobody expects an intern to operate solo. Getting a Chinese interpreter takes 5 minutes. Even a junior med student knows that. Interns and residents are not nearly as dumb as they are portrayed here. The job of the intern is to do scut work. It's really not that hard. You're just a glorified secretary for your superiors. You don't save lives. You don't dole out bad news to family. You don't really even scrub into cases that much. Cut-throat competitiveness is the exception among interns. Camaraderie is the norm. Also, for God's sake nobody touches their mask with bloody gloves. You don't take off your mask in the OR to talk. I could go on and on. It would be nice if Hollywood would hire even a med student as a consultant and pay them a nominal wage to get a little shred of realism.I might sound overly critical but the lack of insight in Grey's Anatomy is not simply annoying but actually forces you to not take the show seriously. On the other hand ER was the most faithful in this regard and I guess that's expected since it was produced by Michael Creighton. Too bad it was not about surgeons. Even Scrubs is much more accurate and ten times more entertaining. I bought two episodes of Grey's. That's 90 minutes and 4 bucks I'll never get back. I should have just read my Greenberg instead...I may be a tough customer because life on the surgical wards is truly exciting not only in terms of the science and medicine but in terms of social drama. Nothing I have seen on television or movies even comes close to capturing this real life excitement and drama on all these levels.	final year med student neurosurgery intern two month spend several year hospital several month subintern major hospital throughout country one unrealistic medical show ever see sure fine drama soap opera expect accurate depiction thing really like surgery nobody expect intern operate solo get chinese interpreter take minute even junior med student know intern resident nearly dumb portray job intern scut work really hard glorify secretary superior save live dole bad news family really even scrub case much cut throat competitiveness exception among intern camaraderie norm also god sake nobody touch mask bloody glove take mask talk could go would nice hollywood would hire even med student consultant pay nominal wage get little shred realism might sound overly critical lack insight grey anatomy simply annoy actually force take show seriously hand er faithful regard guess expect since produce michael creighton bad surgeon even scrub much accurate ten time entertain buy two episode grey minute buck never get back read greenberg instead may tough customer life surgical ward truly excite term science medicine term social drama nothing see television movie even come close capture real life excitement drama level
0	In a disturbing twist of events, a deeply troubled individual attempts to justify their role in enabling another disturbed person to become a stalker, all under the guise of being excessively nice. This unsettling narrative unfolds as a seemingly unfunny comedian shamelessly exploits the vulnerabilities of a troubled woman, all in pursuit of fame. Through self-aggrandizement, the individual paints themselves as a martyr of kindness, but the underlying tragedy lies in their manipulation and exploitation of vulnerable individuals for personal gain. This sad tale serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of unchecked narcissism and the insidious nature of people-pleasing behaviors.	disturb twist event deeply trouble individual attempt justify role enable another disturb person become stalker guise excessively nice unsettle narrative unfold seemingly unfunny comedian shamelessly exploit vulnerability trouble woman pursuit fame self aggrandizement individual paint martyr kindness underlie tragedy lie manipulation exploitation vulnerable individual personal gain sad tale serve stark reminder danger unchecked narcissism insidious nature people please behavior

It's fallout 76 meets elements of fallout 3, some new Vegas with fallout 4 storyline but in the desert. I was looking for something more connected to at least one of the game storylines.

0	To be honest I only watched one and a half episodes.. that's all I could stomach. How do you take a novel that is rooted in scientific expression and decide removing any hint of actual science is the way to go for the TV adaptation. This series appears to be glossing over everything related to the detailed physics of our universe. It's mentioned enough but not nearly to the point where you understand why any scientist would take their own life when physical laws break down. I understand you have to cater to a larger general audience but there's no reason to think people in general aren't sophisticated enough to take interest. Still, that could have been forgiven if you cast appropriately and or with an ounce of respect for the source material, strike out there as well. There is no way these blokes convince any functioning audience that they are our are best and brightest. Not going to go into detail but they are in fact the most boring, self absorbed, condescending, relationship challenged, I'm better than you individuals you'll ever find collected on a sci-fi TV series (well.. maybe Sam from GOT was ok). Speaking of that, the gender swapping political correctness, what the what. I'm all for expressed creativity but Netflix really disappoints here as they were the ones who green lit this atrocity. From the book there is so much interesting content, character dialog, and relatable individuals to pull from. With this story's origins why choose this one to layer in all the empty calories of the modern day Hollywood agenda...	honest watch one half episode could stomach take novel root scientific expression decide remove hint actual science way go tv adaptation series appear glos everything relate detail physics universe mention enough nearly point understand scientist would take life physical law break understand cater large general audience reason think people general sophisticate enough take interest still could forgive cast appropriately ounce respect source material strike well way bloke convince function audience well bright go go detail fact bore self absorb condescend relationship challenge well individual ever find collect sci fi tv series well maybe sam get ok speak gender swap political correctness express creativity netflix really disappoint one green light atrocity book much interest content character dialog relatable individual pull story origin choose one layer empty calorie modern day hollywood agenda

0	"I recommend you just go play the games instead. Fallout doesn't translate well to a tvshow adaptation. It's so laugh out loud bad at times, and it hurts to watch another great franchise getting turned into some awkward rom-com social awarness, commercialised comedy and it will cast a loong negative shadow on future installments and all my interest has absolutely vained considerably.I would say that alot of props, decor and attention to details are commendable but in the bigger picture the actors and the action sequences doesn't sell the illusion.It's the same fate that happened to starwars. Instead of being the most unique and epic scifi that ever existed, where every little trinket, robot and creature felt organic in its enviroments. Now it's the opposite of cool, its a empty CGI asteroid hurling itself into a black hole of nothingness, a cashgrab with neverending fetch quests. Fallout is on that same trajectory.There's not a single actor that has any screen charisma or deliver any convincing performances except Kyle. He seems oblivious to whatever fallout is, and that makes his acting convincing. There's no sense of danger or urgency in these straight to videogame-y scenes. ""Think comedy with terrible cgi effects and cheesy, monotonious performances."" The worst part of it all, is the extremely annoying lead characters wich i couldn't stand. It's impossible to root for these smiley faced protagonists that seems to take everything as a huge joke. The realism and dispair of an apocalyptic wasteland feels more like a staged theme park instead of stepping into a nuclear nightmare.The Fallout games pitch black humor was 100% derived from the absolute hopelessness and wackyness of this crumbled, gritty world. Not with bad oneliners like in the show.I truly believe that the only director that could have captured Fallout's essence, atmosphere, the nightmarish mutated creatures and gore is Paul Verhoeven circa 90s.If you like Vanilla coke instead of Nuka coke i guess this is the family friendly version of Fallout."	recommend go play game instead fallout translate well tvshow adaptation laugh loud bad time hurt watch another great franchise get turn awkward rom com social awarness commercialise comedy cast loong negative shadow future installment interest absolutely vaine considerably would say alot prop decor attention detail commendable big picture actor action sequence sell illusion fate happen starwar instead unique epic scifi ever exist every little trinket robot creature feel organic enviroment opposite cool empty cgi asteroid hurl black hole nothingness cashgrab neverending fetch quest fallout trajectory single actor screen charisma deliver convince performance except kyle seem oblivious whatever fallout make act convince sense danger urgency straight videogame scene think comedy terrible cgi effect cheesy monotonious performance bad part extremely annoy lead character wich stand impossible root smiley face protagonist seem take everything huge joke realism dispair apocalyptic wasteland feel like stag theme park instead step nuclear nightmare fallout game pitch black humor derive absolute hopelessness wackyness crumble gritty world bad oneliner like show truly believe director could capture fallout essence atmosphere nightmarish mutate creature gore paul verhoeven circa like vanilla coke instead nuka coke guess family friendly version fallout

2	This show was a rollercoaster, that's the only word I would use. There was romance, heartbreak, tragedy, comedy and lot and lots of drama. The show was everything to me at one point, I admit I had a slightly concerning attachment to it. However, it wasn't the same after they killed off Mark and Lexie, Derek died, Alex left and Covid was introduced. The show ran on too long, it should've have ended a year after Dereks death. As soon as my favourite characters started leaving, I was annoyed and hurt. I haven't finished the 17tb season as it's too long for me and I have lost interest. It's the only show I have never watched until the end, mainly because it's still going. The seasons before all of that were amazing and entertaining. I loved all the different plots and twists. I think it's fair to say some deaths were very unnecessary.

1	This show goes seriously downhill after they all stop playing the weird video game, and worst of all, they kill off the best character halfway through the series.Benedict Wong is incredible in it and the first few episodes are brilliant and seriously compelling, but it all goes very wrong around the episode 5 mark. Somehow the threat of alien invasion sends the show into the territory of tedium. I agree with others about the serious miscasting of many of the scientist characters- the Auggie and Saul characters in particular don't seem to quite have the gravitas to pull it off, and as the show rests quite heavily on their shoulders, their miscasting really is quite a drawback.	show go seriously downhill stop play weird video game bad kill good character halfway series benedict wong incredible first episode brilliant seriously compel go wrong around episode mark somehow threat alien invasion send show territory tedium agree other serious miscast many scientist character auggie saul character particular seem quite gravita pull show rest quite heavily shoulder miscast really quite drawback

2	The three books by Liu Cixin changed my life. They are by far the best science fiction books I have ever read. The imagination, the science, the philosophy, these books are meant to change you, and the way you see the world and the universe.I was deeply worried about a Netflix adaptation, but I must say I have been glued to this show for it's entire runtime. The main elements are there, and well produced. The CGI is mostly on par, with some scenes far below the standard imposed by the recent Dune movies, but still sufficient for the experience to be great.The weak part of the books, although this is a matter of personal preference, has always been the human aspect of the grand story. The characters in every books (except maybe the second one), are bland, simple cogs in a massive wheel that is the fate of the unierse.The writers here decided to take a different route by embedding this grand story in a very human-scale story of friendship and love between five(six) humans. I was not sold at first, but quickly embraced it. Especially in the last few episodes of season 1. The first book is mostly covered in 5 episodes, so the episodes 6-7-8 use content from the other books and spend more time to dive in the characters who will all take the roles often given to secondary individuals, or by the single main character in the book. Note that in the book the main character does change between books.This decision by the co-producer is a great one, that will most likely displease those who want a perfect rendition. But even if you do decide that this british-centric group of friend is not your cup of tea (no pun intended), I cannot believe any fan of the book giving less than 7/10 for this one, since the main plot, and main events are respected in their whole. Although episodes 3-4-5 are the action-pacted one, I really enjoyed the human scale of episode 6-7-8, and it made me re-discover what is at stake in the books. Making me wish for a second season already.So if you enjoyed the book, don't read the negative reviews, plus yourself in, embrace the little differences, and enjoy. It's worth the ride.	three book liu cixin change life far good science fiction book ever read imagination science philosophy book mean change way see world universe deeply worry netflix adaptation must say glue show entire runtime main element well produce cgi mostly par scene far standard impose recent dune movie still sufficient experience great weak part book although matter personal preference always human aspect grand story character every book except maybe second one bland simple cog massive wheel fate unierse writer decide take different route embed grand story human scale story friendship love five six human sell first quickly embrace especially last episode season first book mostly cover episode episode use content book spend time dive character take role often give secondary individual single main character book note book main character change book decision co producer great one likely displease want perfect rendition even decide british centric group friend cup tea pun intend believe fan book give less one since main plot main event respect whole although episode action pacte one really enjoy human scale episode make discover stake book make wish second season already enjoy book read negative review plus embrace little difference enjoy worth ride
1	I've watched the first 3 episodes and I started watching with great scepticism, that it would be a 'starts good but fizzles out' series.I also like a good post apocalypse story, this is definitely one of those.I gather it's based on a game, i've never seen the game, but it does have an interesting game vibe that is appealing. It doesn't take itself too seriously, yet you are engrossed in the characters and their individual stories (however bizarre)Now I have to watch the remaining episodes and I do hope it continues to the same standard as the first 3 episodes.Solid 7.5/10 and may well increase to an 8/10 by the end .Very watchable.	watch first episode start watch great scepticism would start good fizzle series also like good post apocalypse story definitely one gather base game never see game interest game vibe appeal take seriously yet engross character individual story however bizarre watch remain episode hope continue standard first episode solid may well increase end watchable
1	As other users have mentioned, the first few seasons (1-6) of the show were a phenomenon. A story that had us gossip, speculate, theorize, and enjoy for years.But somewhere after Season 6, the show ran out of book material and into uncharted waters. Blinded by their past success, I assume the show runners felt they were up to the task of taking it to a proper end.In Season 7 you could notice signs of the downfall, like they were trying to foreshadow it.And then Season 8 happened. After a 2 year break the anticipation was as high as it can be. After each failed episode, illogical character arc, rich story line butchered or forgotten, I'd tell myself that maybe the next episode will redeem the show.

2	So first off been a Fallout fan actually since Wasteland.I went into this show with low expectations based on the plummet the games have seen recently.I noticed it only had one major actor I know Walton Goggins.Without spoiling much the first Ep was awkward.However once things got going like in the real games, it was dark and dirty outside.I enjoyed a good many nods to various games though out of base context.I liked the usage of Pipboy which was a staple in games.The FX are weird some are good some seem a bit cheap but ok for a show.The thing that makes this show a 9 to me is even though they screw up a lot, they make up with fun characters and good recoveries.So many videogame or any other media based shows are just filler with little else.I am looking forward to the next season.	first fallout fan actually since wasteland go show low expectation base plummet game see recently notice one major actor know walton goggin without spoil much first ep awkward however thing get go like real game dark dirty outside enjoy good many nod various game though base context like usage pipboy staple game fx weird good seem bite cheap ok show thing make show even though screw lot make fun character good recovery many videogame medium base show filler little else look forward next season
1	This show is made to ruin people's careers. This show has so many gaps running non-weekly as you don't want to see it anymore. After 2 gaps I ended watching it. I will never wait 1 month for 1 episode that must run weekly and even so when you are making us wait another month next month that's wrong. Either you have a strategy to run it with constancy or shut it off. You are doing wrong to these people who play those characters. Too bad it has so many gaps.	show make ruin people career show many gap run non weekly want see anymore gap end watch never wait month episode must run weekly even make we wait another month next month wrong either strategy run constancy shut wrong people play character bad many gap
1	I had the rating at 9 originally. This was one of the best shows on television. Unexpected twist that surprised me, but still made total sense in-universe, had me on my toes. A total lack of plot armor made me fear for my favorite characters like no other show or movie had for a very long time. The politics, the intrigues, the whole story had me in its grip.Then season 8 happened. From no plot armor, the show went to 110% plot armor. The politics are suddenly laughably bad and simple. Characters are propped up while others are torn down for what I can only speculate are the writers injecting hollywood politics into the show. Nothing against strong female characters, some of my favorite movies have female leads, but when it is so obvious that there's an agenda at play, like it is in GoT towards the end, it's just off-putting.The writing was deteriorating since the show overtook the books, but season 8 is bafflingly bad. There's still a few episodes to go, but after episode 3 and 4 I've lost all hope and will stop watching the show alltogether.Such a promising show that ends on such a low note is a shame. GoT has lost all rewatchability and I will probably never watch another episode of this show again and neither will I recommend it to anyone.I've changed my rating from 9 to 5 because the first 4 to 5 seasons are still superb. But the underwhelming and badly written conclusion destroys everything good about the show that came before. A real shame and a lost opportunity. The writers should feel bad and ashamed.	rat originally one good show television unexpected twist surprise still make total sense universe toe total lack plot armor make fear favorite character like show movie long time politic intrigue whole story grip season happen plot armor show go plot armor politic suddenly laughably bad simple character prop other tear speculate writer inject hollywood politic show nothing strong female character favorite movie female lead obvious agenda play like get towards end put write deteriorate since show overtake book season bafflingly bad still episode go episode lose hope stop watch show alltogether promise show end low note shame get lose rewatchability probably never watch another episode show neither recommend anyone change rat first season still superb underwhelme badly write conclusion destroy everything good show come real shame lose opportunity writer feel bad ashamed

0	"I had high hopes for this title as I love the original book so much, and like the Chinese TV series.However, this one make a great sci-fi with great story settings, DEEP PHILOSOPHY and SCIENCE discussions into a plain and simple ""there's some bad alien and bad guy, let's fight them together in the group of CHOSEN ONES, and we should have complex love, sex and other relationships"" story.1st, all characters are kind of lack of depth. Especially Ye Wenjie, who was a soul character, has very complex background and thoughts, so she once hate human, then begin to love some of the human, feeling a little conflict on welcoming the 3 body alien, but still lean towards 3 body alien may bring better things to human. In this movie, I only see hate, blind belief, and... sex? Saul Durand is the role of Luo Ji, who is key to all 3 books, however, he looks like a minor role the whole season, then at last 2 episode, suddenly push him to become a wallfacer. Auggie Salazar should be an important scientist character, but never saw she really worked on science stuff, more like an entrepreneur who drinks and smokes a lot, and always unable to resist the impulse, doesn't seem very rational.2nd, all major storylines are very rushed, it's like suddenly some setting jumped out, without enough, or even no scenes to develop the story. Like why we choose the nano line to cut the ship, why we need wallfacer, all like from nowhere.3rd, the details and story logic are bad. Initially, why Ye Wenjie took the blame on the forbidden book is not clear, just due to blind love on someone who betrayed her? Why is everything about a small group of people from Oxford? Just because they are THE CHOSEN ONES? Why use nano technology to cut the boat? Seems Evans doesn't want to destroy the hard drive at all, her run for mins and didn't destroy it, Just Sent SWAT TEAM! Why did Saul sit with Da Shi in an open Motel Garden after the assassin? He is eager to be killed? How does the cutting edge VR headset come from? Even though 3 body provide the design, Earth doesn't have the equipment and technology to manufacture those kinds of things yet!4th, the visual effect is not good enough, does the universe blink like broken lights? No details on the cutting boat scene also.Last but not least, a lot of important deeper conversation are gone, mainly ALL DEEPER PHILOSOPHY and SCIENCE discussions are missing from this TV series, make the story from a great personal, social and science discussion, into a plain and simple ""there's some bad alien and bad guy, let's fight them together in the group of CHOSEN ONES"" story."	high hop title love original book much like chinese tv series however one make great sci fi great story setting deep philosophy science discussion plain simple bad alien bad guy let fight together group choose one complex love sex relationship story st character kind lack depth especially ye wenjie soul character complex background thought hate human begin love human feel little conflict welcome body alien still lean towards body alien may bring well thing human movie see hate blind belief sex saul durand role luo ji key book however look like minor role whole season last episode suddenly push become wallfacer auggie salazar important scientist character never see really work science stuff like entrepreneur drink smoke lot always unable resist impulse seem rational nd major storyline rush like suddenly set jump without enough even scene develop story like choose nano line cut ship need wallfacer like nowhere rd detail story logic bad initially ye wenjie take blame forbid book clear due blind love someone betray everything small group people oxford choose one use nano technology cut boat seem evan want destroy hard drive run min destroy send swat team saul sit da shi open motel garden assassin eager kill cut edge vr headset come even though body provide design earth equipment technology manufacture kind thing yet th visual effect good enough universe blink like break light detail cut boat scene also last least lot important deep conversation go mainly deep philosophy science discussion miss tv series make story great personal social science discussion plain simple bad alien bad guy let fight together group choose one story
0	I got 17 minutes into it and turned it off. This does look like it can be a great TV series, but it is not suitable for people like me who like to multitask while watching TV. I'm busy. I am working from home. I like watching TV shows in the background while working on my computer. If I like the show, I'll usually binge watch it again, like I did with Vikings. Even though I am working while watching TV, I can generally get a good sense for what is happening and can keep up with the show.However, Shogun is not for those who like to multitask. It requires intent watching because a good deal of it is not in English. I understand the creators want to keep authenticity, but I intentionally used the example of Vikings. Vikings was a great show, yet it was in English.Hopefully, I will be able to find it with English dubbed down the road, but to not have it in English from the get go seems silly. Anyway, I'm disappointed because it does seem like a good series, but I can't waste time reading subtitles. I envy those who have the time to do so.	get minute turn look like great tv series suitable people like like multitask watch tv busy work home like watch tv show background work computer like show usually binge watch like viking even though work watch tv generally get good sense happen keep show however shogun like multitask require intent watch good deal english understand creator want keep authenticity intentionally use example viking viking great show yet english hopefully able find english dub road english get go seem silly anyway disappoint seem like good series waste time read subtitle envy time

It's not just a story of stalking, sexual abuse, emotional rollercoster or the transexiality but the story of a life.One of the best limited series in last few years on Netflix. Every minute spend is worth. What's not good in this series. The portrayal of Donny Dunn and Martha Scott just goes beyond imagination. The ending so fulfilling knowing the other side of the story is also been told.

I don't want to give a bad review to the actress, but instead to the character....understand? I'm sure the actress is a wonderful woman, but man! Poor girl has the worst lines ever!

0	"Saw this mysterious series starting on Netflix and decided to give it a try. I had never heard of the books, so I had no idea what this was about, but very quickly realized, okay, it's an alien invasion story. Let's see where this goes.The initial setup was intriguing with the visions, the VR headset, and some kind of secret investigation into all of it. And then it all fell apart for me in one scene - the scene where the alien cult leader on the ship is telling his alien overlords the story of Little Red Riding Hood, and they just don't get it. The alien voice says it's a lie and becomes shocked and horrified that humans lie! Then the aliens cut off all communication based on this revelation.Really? An alien species that has access to every aspect of human civilization doesn't know this?The aliens communicate using an elaborate VR game that represents their world's survival problem, and they don't get metaphor? It IS a metaphor.The aliens display themselves as a Ninja lady because their real form would be too disturbing for the humans, and they don't recognize this as deception... i.e., lying?Then when the leader of the intelligence agency along with other smart characters all put on their VR headsets to view the aliens' presentation on sophons, none of them call the aliens out on their obvious BS. They've all heard the recording of the conversation. Why don't any of these smart people say, ""Hey, aliens, you're lying to us right now by not revealing your true form! And you're so smart yet you don't get that the wolf story was a metaphor about not trusting people... exactly the lesson you learned, and we should have learned, because that's how we teach children."" Nope, no character ever realizes this, which means none of the writers realize it either. In fact, it's like the writers have never seen an alien invasion movie in their life. They play with these tropes like they just discovered them for the first time ever. While we the viewers have seen these things used in countless media.Thematically, there's an exchange that sums up this entire series. The intel director asks the Chinese investigator,""You're going to be watching this kid for the rest of your life, are you okay with that?"" The investigator replies, ""Do I have a choice?"" The director says, ""No."" The investigator answers, ""Then I'm okay with it.""From the beginning when the young Chinese girl is taken to work at the observatory to this point, no one seems to have any choice. Even the guy who refuses to be a ""Wall Watcher"" (or whatever it is) ultimately has no choice. The nanofiber girl wants out, but they still use her work for the ill fated frozen head project... which is so dumb... such an incredibly dumb idea, and yet no one can speak up and say that. It almost makes you forgive the lady who called the aliens in the first place. Because thematically, we're just replacing one authoritarian system for another and hoping the next one is more benevolent and effective.They clearly need to call up a Bruce Willis or Will Smith to deal with these aliens, because the current team is not up to the task..."	see mysterious series start netflix decide give try never hear book idea quickly realize okay alien invasion story let see go initial setup intrigue vision vr headset kind secret investigation fall apart one scene scene alien cult leader ship tell alien overlord story little red rid hood get alien voice say lie become shock horrify human lie alien cut communication base revelation really alien species access every aspect human civilization know alien communicate use elaborate vr game represent world survival problem get metaphor metaphor alien display ninja lady real form would disturb human recognize deception e lie leader intelligence agency along smart character put vr headset view alien presentation sophon none call alien obvious bs hear record conversation smart people say hey alien lie we right reveal true form smart yet get wolf story metaphor trust people exactly lesson learn learn teach child nope character ever realize mean none writer realize either fact like writer never see alien invasion movie life play trope like discover first time ever viewer see thing use countless medium thematically exchange sum entire series intel director ask chinese investigator go watch kid rest life okay investigator reply choice director say investigator answer okay begin young chinese girl take work observatory point one seem choice even guy refuse wall watcher whatever ultimately choice nanofiber girl want still use work ill fat freeze head project dumb incredibly dumb idea yet one speak say almost make forgive lady call alien first place thematically replace one authoritarian system another hop next one benevolent effective clearly need call bruce willis smith deal alien current team task

0	I'm not a fan of the books. Actually I've only read the second book on a recommendation of a friend who said that he really liked the second and you don't need a lot of background info from the first to understand what is going on.The main premise of the books is more or less ok, but the Cultural Revolution inserts I felt were really badly written and full of adolescent cliche and overall, I never felt it was anywhere close to the best sci-fi books. I know that the trilogy has a lot of fans, but I thought it was some sort of a fluke.When I heard that Benioff & Weiss were adapting the books for a Netflix series, I thought that maybe I missed something in the books and given that I was a big fan of Game of Thrones series (and, actually, not that big fans of the books), I thought they might pull off a strong series even if the source material was 'meh'.Well, watched three episodes and had to conclude that this is simply bad - unbelievable plot, unbelievable characters, slow pace, zero empathy to anyone and anything happening on the screen - basically, everything that could go wrong did go wrong here. A blinking night sky was actually the last nail in the coffin, I have zero interest watching a series where extraterrestrial force is so unsubtle and illogical. It's just silly and a waste of time.	fan book actually read second book recommendation friend say really like second need lot background info first understand go main premise book less ok cultural revolution insert feel really badly write full adolescent cliche overall never feel anywhere close good sci fi book know trilogy lot fan think sort fluke hear benioff weiss adapt book netflix series think maybe miss something book give big fan game throne series actually big fan book think might pull strong series even source material meh well watch three episode conclude simply bad unbelievable plot unbelievable character slow pace zero empathy anyone anything happen screen basically everything could go wrong go wrong blink night sky actually last nail coffin zero interest watch series extraterrestrial force unsubtle illogical silly waste time
1	First and foremost, all the actors are truly exceptional. However, as I delved deeper into the narrative, I began to question whether I was witnessing a profound human drama or a story about a mentally unstable man. The chaos surrounding the protagonist seemed largely self-inflicted, leading to a sense of confusion. While the grooming scene was remarkably authentic, the confession and coming-out scenes felt somewhat contrived. Perhaps I am still struggling to understand why he identified with Martha and why he fell so deeply in love with Teri. Nevertheless, I find myself intrigued by the genuine events that inspired this story.	first foremost actor truly exceptional however delve deep narrative begin question whether witness profound human drama story mentally unstable man chaos surround protagonist seem largely self inflict lead sense confusion groom scene remarkably authentic confession come scene feel somewhat contrive perhaps still struggle understand identify martha fall deeply love teri nevertheless find intrigue genuine event inspire story
1	Golly. I had high hopes for this one based on a few reviews I read. But geez, nothing could have prepared me for my disappointment.Apart from exploring some slightly intriguing sciency/fictiony ideas, the dialogue is only marginally better than a B-Grade soap opera, and no amount of acting chops could improve that. Sadly, there wasn't anyone capable of delivering a performance to even try to raise the standard.Some giant leaps in plot development, leaving too many questions unanswered is also a bit of a problem.Honestly, 5/10 is probably a bit generous, but I felt sorry for the crew and caterers.	golly high hop one base review read geez nothing could prepare disappointment apart explore slightly intrigue sciency fictiony idea dialogue marginally well b grade soap opera amount act chop could improve sadly anyone capable deliver performance even try raise standard giant leap plot development leave many question unanswered also bite problem honestly probably bite generous feel sorry crew caterer

1	"I was surprised that I generally like this show, but it is well acted, well directed, and have plenty of good characters to keep you invested.The problem here is that the show turns into a regular day time soap opera fairly quickly and that the characters, albeit lovely and great, are also mostly just there and are just soapy rather than growing developing persons. Another issue I have with this show is the sound design and music, which is actually kinda bad. I almost get the feeling the show-runners want to portrait a 1970s cop show and put in music and sound design to match. This is also a bit cliche. Most storylines and events we have seen a hundred times over and together with the soapy feel the show often turns into a chore. My final objection is that these police officers are tasks with solving murders, being arson specialists, they go undercover, they work with the FBI, they interact with and interview serial killers, and they solve all types of crimes... but they are normal beat cops... normal officers. When they for the 111th time singlehandedly solve a murder I'm just so over it.With that said this is still a okay/good TV, especially for today. Compared to most other shows today this is good. I am especially happy with the acting and general feel of the show. The directors use the ""shaky cam"" and ""body cam"" to almost perfection. Another thing which they nail is the extras and temporary actors playing villains, drug dealers etc. They are all very greatly cast and very well acted, and that helps immensely to sell the show.I have a few other nitpicks and positives, but at the end of the day this is a well acted, good procedural drama that, despite the somewhat soapy feel and cliches, is worth a watch. Perhaps the only really negative thing to say is that it overstays its welcome. This show as gone on for too long already after 2 seasons, and currently we are on its 6th. Don't get me wrong, this is still watchable, but there is no reason to drag this out. The writing and acting is not that great.Worth a watch and a 6/10 from me, but don't overthink it. What make this show work is the acting and the characters, but in the long run that is not enough."	surprise generally like show well act well direct plenty good character keep invest problem show turn regular day time soap opera fairly quickly character albeit lovely great also mostly soapy rather grow develop person another issue show sound design music actually kinda bad almost get feel show runner want portrait cop show put music sound design match also bite cliche storyline event see hundred time together soapy feel show often turn chore final objection police officer task solve murder arson specialist go undercover work fbi interact interview serial killer solve type crime normal beat cop normal officer th time singlehandedly solve murder say still okay good tv especially today compare show today good especially happy act general feel show director use shaky cam body cam almost perfection another thing nail extras temporary actor play villain drug dealer etc greatly cast well act help immensely sell show nitpick positive end day well act good procedural drama despite somewhat soapy feel cliche worth watch perhaps really negative thing say overstay welcome show go long already season currently th get wrong still watchable reason drag write act great worth watch overthink make show work act character long run enough
0	Very poor acting and direction. May be poor casting choice - Whenever Ms Maclean and Maximus are shown - they simply destroyed their characters. It certainly killed the vibe of the game. Ms maclean character seemed portrayed as a teen whereas she is an adult who has zero to none understanding about outside world/zero self defence and she lived due to mercy of others. Though she is attacked, she behaves like a teen - no seriousness at all. Whereas maximus - his character is simply powerless. Play the game folks. Only entertainment is ghoul - superb acting and casting choice. Also this confuses - who are the actual target audience.	poor act direction may poor cast choice whenever ms maclean maximus show simply destroy character certainly kill vibe game ms maclean character seem portray teen whereas adult zero none understand outside world zero self defence live due mercy other though attack behave like teen seriousness whereas maximus character simply powerless play game folk entertainment ghoul superb act cast choice also confuse actual target audience
2	Shogun is everything I hoped it would be and more. I've been looking forward to this ever since I first heard about it. My excitement grew even more when I saw the trailer. On top that it's gotten great reviews and currently has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. I thought my expectations were going to be too much and it'd be a let down but it's not. It's everything I'd hoped and more. I love this kind of genre. This premise kind of looked like The Last Samurai movie with Tom Cruise and I loved that movie as well. The story is told from the perspective of a British hero named John Blackthorne and his crew as they help Lord Torango in his war. This series just pulls you into their world and doesn't let go and you don't want it to. I've enjoyed every second of this.	shogun everything hop would look forward ever since first hear excitement grow even see trailer top get great review currently rotten tomato think expectation go much let everything hop love kind genre premise kind look like last samurai movie tom cruise love movie well story tell perspective british hero name john blackthorne crew help lord torango war series pull world let go want enjoy every second
1	"My favorite part of the entire series was the opening sequence that shows the bombs dropping, and even that I had some issues with, like nukes dont explode slowly enough for people to have time to say ""oh no honey thats just smoke from a fire"" (watch the trinity test footage). Im all for dramatic effect, but make it realistic. That being said, the scene was intense and beautifully acted by Goggins and I got goosebumps. Sadly the rest of the series didnt have the same effectThe fallout series took a tone shift with the arrival of Fallout 4. Prior to that, yes humor and absurdity were present, but they were sprinkled in amongst the backdrop of a desolate dying world with cruelty and horror around every corner. In fallout 3, often the first person you encounter is a homeless guy begging for a sip of clean water. He's not goofy, weird, or absurd in any way, he's just a normal human. There are slavers that keep kids in cages with bomb collars around their neck. Thats the kind of world we're in. The show however feels like its turned that formula on its head. It feels more like humor and absurdity are now the primary focus with sprinklings of reminders that ""oh dont forget we're in a post apocolyptic wasteland"". And Fallout 4, which the show seems to be most emulating, seemed to be the beginning of that tone shift, where the colors were a little brighter, the characters a little wackier, the sense of dread a little less present. The show has taken this to the next level with brotherhood knights that act like delinquent teenagers, organ harvesting drug dealers that watch tv all day and act like stoners, and a goofy brain in a roomba being the mastermind behind a vault conspiracy. I wanted more scenes and characters like norm, moldaver, charlie whiteknife, and barbara, who took their circumstances very seriously and whose perfomances sucked me into the world.Then there's the issue of certain elements of the show feeling hollow and not given the weight or depth they deserve. Like the scene where all the big corporations are meeting with vault tec. It seemed way too easy for a meeting like that to have been spied on, barbara even noticed her pipboy was transmitting but decided to still attend that meeting with it on? Come on. Then she just casually says in the meeting ""by dropping the bomb ourselves"" admitting to all these ceo's present that vault tec is considering creating the nuclear holocaust themselves. Info like that you'd barely share with people inside the company let alone blurting it out point blank to other companies unless you know they're fully on board. And all these ceo's present were ok with the end of the world, the end of their empires, in exchange for a few vaults where they could run human experiments? Maybe they were but they didnt give any indication as to why. And vault tec said this would be an opportunity to end conflict by outliving all enemies and having a single monopoly. How? When you're giving away vaults to other companies with their own ideas on how to run things how does that result in a single monopoly and not just another bunch of factions bickering and warring over the right way to do things? It feels like there's so much missing here, so much that has been glossed over and just thrown together without attention to detail or nuance. This is the kind of meeting that you'd find in a climactic scene of a show like 24 or Homeland, where multiple government agencies have expended mind boggling amounts of time and resources to get a recording of, that we as the viewer have been slowly piecing together over the course of the season, but in fallout this incredibly precious info feels unearned and like its just being lazily told to us for a plot point. The idea that vault tec started the war is something that people have been speculating since the inception of the fallout series and it didnt feel like the grand revelation it deserved to be.Another culprit of this was the scene where Lucy learns about her father. I didnt buy the father's performance trying to stop Moldaver from revealing the truth. And Lucy seemed to accept this reality way too easily (you're gonna believe that your father who you love nuked a town cause some lady who killed your friends and family told you so?) Again just lacked depth and nuance and left me wanting.My hope for season 2 is that we get more depth and nuance and the creators lean more into the gritty nature of the earlier fallout entries and lose some of the ""oh darn i missed every shot cause I suck without a scope on"" goofiness."	favorite part entire series open sequence show bomb drop even issue like nuke do not explode slowly enough people time say oh honey that s smoke fire watch trinity test footage I m dramatic effect make realistic say scene intense beautifully act goggin get goosebump sadly rest series do not effectthe fallout series take tone shift arrival fallout prior yes humor absurdity present sprinkle amongst backdrop desolate die world cruelty horror around every corner fallout often first person encounter homeless guy beg sip clean water goofy weird absurd way normal human slaver keep kid cage bomb collar around neck that s kind world show however feel like turn formula head feel like humor absurdity primary focus sprinkle reminder oh do not forget post apocolyptic wasteland fallout show seem emulate seem begin tone shift color little bright character little wacky sense dread little less present show take next level brotherhood knight act like delinquent teenager organ harvest drug dealer watch tv day act like stoner goofy brain roomba mastermind behind vault conspiracy want scene character like norm moldaver charlie whiteknife barbara take circumstance seriously whose perfomance suck world issue certain element show feel hollow give weight depth deserve like scene big corporation meet vault tec seem way easy meet like spy barbara even notice pipboy transmit decide still attend meet come casually say meet drop bomb admit ceo present vault tec consider create nuclear holocaust info like barely share people inside company let alone blurt point blank company unless know fully board ceo present ok end world end empire exchange vault could run human experiment maybe do not give indication vault tec say would opportunity end conflict outlive enemy single monopoly give away vault company idea run thing result single monopoly another bunch faction bicker war right way thing feel like much miss much gloss throw together without attention detail nuance kind meet find climactic scene show like homeland multiple government agency expend mind boggle amount time resource get record viewer slowly piece together course season fallout incredibly precious info feel unearned like lazily tell we plot point idea vault tec start war something people speculate since inception fallout series do not feel like grand revelation deserve another culprit scene lucy learn father do not buy father performance try stop moldaver reveal truth lucy seem accept reality way easily go to believe father love nuke town cause lady kill friend family tell lack depth nuance leave want hope season get depth nuance creator lean gritty nature early fallout entry lose oh darn miss every shoot cause suck without scope goofiness
0	It was fun, it was witty, it was charming.That was at the beginning of Grey's anatomy: during Season 1. Elle Pompeo was cute, Patrick Dempsey was handsome, and Katherine Heigl was gorgeous.The second season turned the characters into selfish self-centered individuals that constantly whine about their own little selves. There is nothing enjoyable: every time a moral dilemma is presented, they make the wrong ethical choice in the name of love, friendship, whatever. Doctors must go wild when they watch that show. It is completely unbelievable.Now, what happened to the actors: Ellen Pompeo looks like she has a stuffed nose all the time, Patrick Dempsey looks like he is about to cry on every frame, and they even ruined Katherine Heigl for me.Damn you.	fun witty charm begin grey anatomy season elle pompeo cute patrick dempsey handsome katherine heigl gorgeous second season turn character selfish self center individual constantly whine little self nothing enjoyable every time moral dilemma present make wrong ethical choice name love friendship whatever doctor must go wild watch show completely unbelievable happen actor ellen pompeo look like stuff nose time patrick dempsey look like cry every frame even ruin katherine heigl damn

2	Visually stunning with good acting, dialogue, direction. Japanese representation is extremely authentic and feels like a native high-budget period piece (jidaigeki).Unfortunately, people unfamiliar with the historical backdrop and the characters might find the first episode to be a bit confusing and overwhelming with many characters introduced in a short period of time amid multiple international tensions. Those familiar with the original series or the books should be fine, and the rest of the series should be more enjoyable once the main characters and their roles are firmly fleshed out. If the production value continues in this manner, I very much look forward to the rest of this series.	visually stun good act dialogue direction japanese representation extremely authentic feel like native high budget period piece jidaigeki unfortunately people unfamiliar historical backdrop character might find first episode bite confuse overwhelm many character introduce short period time amid multiple international tension familiar original series book fine rest series enjoyable main character role firmly flesh production value continue manner much look forward rest series
2	"I am writing this section as I am experiencing the here-after, even though the here-now rears as the child of fifty. Ponder this question at will: has the abomination of the clear and sufficient stream of duration been enough for the child? This question is of a different tonal character than what has come before. The history of the English (let us call it that), the abolished and intricate web of flesh, has long since been present in the philosophical inquiry of the great Brentano. I will not be lengthy in this matter, but would withdraw any statements about the ""Sho gun"" (as it is correctly spelled!) and the ""Sho gin"" (as is customary for the apparition). Furthermore, this has been explained as a tower, a rising value of effort that encapsulates three different movements (again this magic number!). The way the English, or hereafter simply Man, adapts the here-now as a junction of positions is never quite clear. Nonetheless, returning to this ""review"" 400 days later, the notion appears sufficient."	write section experience even though rear child fifty ponder question abomination clear sufficient stream duration enough child question different tonal character come history english let we call abolish intricate web flesh long since present philosophical inquiry great brentano lengthy matter would withdraw statement sho gun correctly spell sho gin customary apparition furthermore explain tower rise value effort encapsulate three different movement magic number way english hereafter simply man adapt junction position never quite clear nonetheless return review day later notion appear sufficient
2	The cinematography is simply outstanding and this is absolutely the lushest B&W production that I've ever seen. I'm so glad that they were brave-enough to shoot it in B&W. The settings are simply gorgeous, all told it's. Feast for the eyes. Andrew Scott is magnificent in a very restrained role. I've not read the book, but I do understand that this production is fairly faithful to it. It's amazing that this high of quality could exist on Netflix.The real star of the show are the various sets/locations, the expert cinematography, the writing, etc. I'm on my second round of binging this series.	cinematography simply outstanding absolutely lush b w production ever see glad brave enough shoot b w setting simply gorgeous tell feast eye andrew scott magnificent restrain role read book understand production fairly faithful amaze high quality could exist netflix real star show various set location expert cinematography write etc second round binge series

0	The Rookie was a semi entertaining show for the first couple seasons. Something to watch in case of boredom. John Nolan is an entertaining character with some great supporting characters as well. There is no way an LA Police Officer could have purchased the home he did. And real police don't have major gun battles with every shift. Storyline is so unrealistic it's sad. Then I'm the later seasons they started pushing leftist propaganda into their storyline. So I have stopped watching. I thought the show was about John Nolan. Instead it's about convincing the viewers to follow liberal politics. So you've lost this viewer because I don't think your political beliefs belong in my entertainment.	rookie semi entertain show first couple season something watch case boredom john nolan entertain character great support character well way la police officer could purchase home real police major gun battle every shift storyline unrealistic sad later season start push leftist propaganda storyline stop watch think show john nolan instead convince viewer follow liberal politic lose viewer think political belief belong entertainment
1	Half way of the show now, and honestly i think it's not half bad. Solid sci-fi screen adaptation, good pace and okayish CGI. I don't think screen adaptions must follow the original book, however it's still no nessisary to make this much changes, and divide characters like this. And i have to say it really not nessisary to be THIS MUCH political correct. I don't mind to see diversity of characters or femal power, but it was just carried out that makes you feel too forced. Some lines are out of context and just to be there for the political correctness, that's really unnecessary. Still i would like to recommend, it's still nice entertainment after all.	half way show honestly think half bad solid sci fi screen adaptation good pace okayish cgi think screen adaption must follow original book however still nessisary make much change divide character like say really nessisary much political correct mind see diversity character femal power carry make feel force line context political correctness really unnecessary still would like recommend still nice entertainment
2	The plot has been simplified too much, skipping many developments, and the pace is too fast, leaving many areas unclearly explained. There's a lack of the gradual unfolding of the story that brings a sense of surprise. Liu Cixin's original work, especially the first part, focused heavily on character development, particularly Ye Wenjie, who throughout the entire book becomes too one-dimensional. Her emotions should be complex, and there should be differences in psychology between her youth and old age. The characters all feel too flat. However, Yun Tianming's adaptation is decent, and the actor's performance is excellent. The visual effects, especially the cosmic scenes, which were highly anticipated, lack the necessary impact. On the bright side, the gaming and dehydration aspects are satisfying, reminiscent of how I imagined them while reading. Overall, it's okay, but it's just that it's been simplified too much compared to the original.	plot simplify much skip many development pace fast leave many area unclearly explain lack gradual unfold story bring sense surprise liu cixin original work especially first part focus heavily character development particularly ye wenjie throughout entire book become one dimensional emotion complex difference psychology youth old age character feel flat however yun tianme adaptation decent actor performance excellent visual effect especially cosmic scene highly anticipate lack necessary impact bright side game dehydration aspect satisfy reminiscent imagine read overall okay simplify much compare original
1	I fell in love with the series from the first episode, I liked the main idea of how an aged person changes his life and profession. I think, season 1 is excellent, a balance between comedy and drama looks interesting. The second season is a little weaker, but still good. And then I saw the third, 4th season...Oh, boy. It's great when ideas about freedom, respect, freedom of speech are promoted in a cinema. But It's just a pity that in modern Western society and in modern cinema we do not see this, we see the propaganda of distorted, substituted concepts. The authors simply adjusted to modern fashion, just tried to please trends. We all hear the howls of different movements about equality, but the truth is that this is hypocrisy, because as soon as these communities get to the mouthpiece, they themselves begin to breed inequality, try to humiliate the opposite side, elevate themselves. It's pathetic. The picture of the world that the series paints is so sickly artificial, fake. I would be glad to see the script, where men and women are equal in their opportunities and rights, despite the fact that they are different in nature, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and that is great, diversity is great. But instead of the ideas that men and women are worth each other, that they need each other, instead of the ideas of goodness, the authors impose on us the idea that it is normal to humiliate and hate someone who is not like you. Just very veiled. For example, that a woman is better in everything, and a man is pathetic and insignificant. And they poke you with it in every episode, but if you're smart enough, you can't help but notice it. Yes, women are great, just like men, just like any healthy person. But the way the series tries to impose its distorted picture of the world is disrespectful to the viewer. I'm sorry that a good series has gone bad. The problem is not in the topic being raised, but in HOW it is done, clumsily, disrespectful.	fall love series first episode like main idea age person change life profession think season excellent balance comedy drama look interest second season little weak still good see third th season oh boy great idea freedom respect freedom speech promote cinema pity modern western society modern cinema see see propaganda distort substitute concept author simply adjust modern fashion try please trend hear howl different movement equality truth hypocrisy soon community get mouthpiece begin breed inequality try humiliate opposite side elevate pathetic picture world series paint sickly artificial fake would glad see script man woman equal opportunity right despite fact different nature strength weaknesse great diversity great instead idea man woman worth need instead ideas goodness author impose we idea normal humiliate hate someone like veil example woman well everything man pathetic insignificant poke every episode smart enough help notice yes woman great like man like healthy person way series try impose distort picture world disrespectful viewer sorry good series go bad problem topic raise do clumsily disrespectful

Yes, an icicle!!!!! Are you kidding me? I thought maybe this was supposed to be a comedy but I was informed it is indeed a drama.

1	"Yes, this is quite unique. Yes, it's gritty. Yes, the acting for the most part is quite good. However, for those of us who have lived a relatively conventional life without drug abuse, repeated sexual attacks and self-torture, it's too awful to be watchable. I peaced out during episode 5 or 6 after enduring enough despicable behavior to last me a lifetime. The lead character is every bit as horrible in his way as the woman who stalks him, leading her on and keeping her around for his own gratification. I could find nothing redeeming about any of it and felt more like a voyeur than a viewer. It's depressing. It's frustrating. I'll leave this one to the cinema connoisseurs who ""get"" this sort of thing in a way I never will."	yes quite unique yes gritty yes act part quite good however we live relatively conventional life without drug abuse repeat sexual attack self torture awful watchable peace episode endure enough despicable behavior last lifetime lead character every bite horrible way woman stalk lead keep around gratification could find nothing redeem feel like voyeur view depress frustrate leave one cinema connoisseur get sort thing way never

2	"With her Tom Ripley, the American writer Patricia HIGHSMITH created a ""man without qualities"" for the post-war period. There are already two great film adaptations of her great 1955 novel: PLEIN SOLEIL (1959) with Alain DELON (and Romy SCHNEIDER in a cameo) and THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY (1999) with Matt DAMON. Do we need another series? And then also in black and white pictures?Despite all the skepticism in advance, Steven ZAILLIAN (ACADEMY AWARD 1994 for the screenplay for SCHINDLER'S LIST) has created something masterful with Andrew SCOTT as Tom Ripley, which will hopefully be continued in the film adaptation of the four following Tom Ripley novels by the great master Patricia HIGHSMITH . Even those who already know the story from the novel itself or the two film adaptations mentioned will quickly be drawn under the spell of these calm and clear images. Episodes 3 and 5 are particularly impressive because of the calmly filmed action explosions.Instead of the mid-1950s, the action has been moved to the early 1960s, which can be heard in the first hits of the fantastic Italian singer MINA. The love for art in general and for Caravaggio in particular can also be better illustrated.While the film adaptation with Alain DELON was at least somewhat marred by an overly moral ending, forty years later Matt DAMON was able to emphasize the homoerotic component of the plot more strongly. This is also present in the NETFLIX series, but Ripley, played by Andrew SCOTT, is also simply a clever con artist who is primarily interested in the lure of riches and the beautiful life that comes with it. This certainly meets Patricia HIGHSMITH's intentions. Tom Ripley is what other people want to see him as. He doesn't really care whether he has to be heterosexual or homosexual. The main thing is that he can carry out his plans smoothly.Louis HOFMANN and John MALKOVICH can be seen in supporting roles. The latter plays a character that will become even more important in the Tom Ripley cosmos. A sequel is definitely planned by the makers. The producers also include DIOGENES ENTERTAINMENT, a subsidiary of DIOGENES Verlag from Zurich, which publishes the German-language translations of Patricia HIGHSMITH's works.

2	"In my mind, Alain Delon in Rene Clement's 1960 ""Purple Noon"" was the definitive Tom Ripley. Beautiful and totally amoral. Anthony Minghella's 1999 ""The Talented Mr Ripley"" had a bland but thoughtful Tom Ripley who felt and suffered. Minghella had a superb script, Gwyneth Paltrow, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Cate Blanchett playing riveting, unforgettable characters. There was also John Malcovich in a Liliana Cavani version, and although I've seen it, I don''t remember it, isn't that terrible? And the Wim Wenders version with Dennis Hopper doesn't count, good film, but it doesn't count as a version of Patricia Highsmith's novel. Now this. Ripley, the series. Hours long, in black and white. My first reaction was to rejected it but the truth is that I finish seeing it over a week ago and stayed with me, I can't shake it off. Why I wonder. And the reason is very simple. Steven Zaillian's version is truly wonderful. He has de-glamorized it. The whole thing. The story, the characters. Oh the characters. I was so used to see beautiful people playing them, in gloriously glamorous locations. This version is stark and Andrew Scott is like a replicant. No emotions, not even a hint of them. Invisible. As a consequence we do all the work. We gasp or look away. He just goes on. I know I'm going to see Ripley again, maybe not tomorrow but soon. I suspect you will too."	mind alain delon rene clement purple noon definitive tom ripley beautiful totally amoral anthony minghella talente mr ripley bland thoughtful tom ripley feel suffer minghella superb script gwyneth paltrow philip seymour hoffman cate blanchett play rivet unforgettable character also john malcovich liliana cavani version although see remember terrible wim wenders version dennis hopper count good film count version patricia highsmith novel ripley series hour long black white first reaction reject truth finish see week ago stay shake wonder reason simple steven zaillian version truly wonderful de glamorize whole thing story character oh character use see beautiful people play gloriously glamorous location version stark andrew scott like replicant emotion even hint invisible consequence work gasp look away go know go see ripley maybe tomorrow soon suspect

It's really, really stupid in my humble opinion.Every single doctor in every single season hooks up with every single doctor or nurse (or sometimes even patients) of the opposite sex (or obviously the same sex if we're talking about one of the characters that is gay).Also the stories are ridiculous. People come into this same Seattle hospital every week with the most ridiculous injuries and problems. Some guy with an old world world two bomb stuck in his stomach that could detonate any minute.

2	3 Body Problem: The first novel in the trilogy by Cixin Liu has been adapted for television. Much of the action has been shifted to the UK with Liam Cunningham playing Wade the Intelligence Chief who is fighting the Aliens. Great to have an M with a Dublin accent! The china sequences set during the cultural Revolution are important to the development of the plot and even more so to one of the main character's attitudes towards the Aliens. The advanced VR games are neatly slotted into this series as is the a;iens ability to control some events from and be seen by some humans as lords. Conspiracies, assassinations, scientists committing suicide and a united UN Security Council (!) along with d centuries spanning plan allow the narrative to unfold. A dark series, lots of violence and gory deaths from the outset. Don't miss this masterful adaptation. Created by David Benioff, D. B.

1	For those who haven't read the books: go watch this. A lot of the amazing concepts are explored and shown beautifully on-screen. The production quality is fantastic. If you loved it, please read the books, they will allow you to explore everything in far greater detail and truly digest it.For those who have read the books: beware and have an open mind. I fully understand why they completely transplanted the setting and shuffled many of the characters, as well as the timeline. It's an ambitious effort, which I think didn't succeeded in the way they wanted. Some of the characters in the book, particularly book 2 and 3, are somewhat flat and one-dimensional. This is okay, as they really are just vessels to tell a great civilizational epic and study of the human condition. They tried to change that, making the show more character-driven. However, at the same time they rush things, leaving you little time to sit and ponder and making the character arcs even worse than they are in the books.But at the same time, the concepts are still amazingly brought. Some of the moments that you wonder how they will put them on the screen, are wonderfully executed. The final episode gave me goosebumps, you'll know what I'm talking about it.Enjoy and be happy that this story now has a great, approachable adaptation.	read book go watch lot amaze concept explore show beautifully screen production quality fantastic love please read book allow explore everything far great detail truly digest read book beware open mind fully understand completely transplant set shuffle many character well timeline ambitious effort think succeed way want character book particularly book somewhat flat one dimensional okay really vessel tell great civilizational epic study human condition try change make show character drive however time rush thing leave little time sit ponder make character arc even bad book time concept still amazingly bring moment wonder put screen wonderfully execute final episode give goosebump know talk enjoy happy story great approachable adaptation
0	The sense of Japan , history and culture is excellent but ruined by the European angle and level of importance . That angle is the weakness and reduces the impact of the intrigue and chivalry of the clan history. Sanaa and sawai are brilliant and I loved every scene they were in but my enjoyment dropped when Jarvis as the English hero entered. Most in the west are unaware of the richness of the Japanese culture in the 17th century and this was an opportunity to explore same. I usually like dramas to stick to the book but in this instance I would have been very heavy for a heavily adapted screenplay.	sense japan history culture excellent ruin european angle level importance angle weakness reduce impact intrigue chivalry clan history sanaa sawai brilliant love every scene enjoyment drop jarvis english hero enter west unaware richness japanese culture th century opportunity explore usually like drama stick book instance would heavy heavily adapt screenplay

And 18 seasons later I still am, still love the stories, the humour and the locations. I visited Seattle in 2011 (wasn't watching the series at that point yet) and now I see all those landmarks I saw in real life and I can just imagine me walking there, meeting Meredith and all of Grey Sloan residents... As far as I'm concerned, this series can keep on going for many more seasons! Even when Ellen Pompeo would decide to stop playing Meredith Grey, there's a lot of other stories to tell. I've come to love each doctor, each resident, each nurse in this hospital!

However, if you're unsure or feel it doesn't meet that standard, then it falls short.Why do I ask this question? Because the novel ""The Three-Body Problem"" is universally acknowledged as a masterpiece, even considered one of the greatest contemporary science fiction works worldwide. It's astonishing that such a celebrated novel has been adapted into a mundane romantic sci-fi series. Without having read the novel, you might find the series passable. But you need to understand a fact: the original novel's brilliance surpasses this series by a hundredfold.As to whether fidelity to the source material is crucial, I don't believe it is. If the screenwriter has better creative ideas, adaptations can be made. However, it's evident that the screenwriter likely didn't thoroughly read the original novel, as many brilliant parts have been omitted and replaced with irrelevant content. This is alarming and has led to numerous factual errors and distortions of the novel's core story.If the content of the original novel and this series were the same, it definitely wouldn't stand a chance at winning the Hugo Award.These are my feelings after carefully watching the entire series. If I hadn't read the original novel beforehand, I might also have found the plot not too bad. But I would undoubtedly be very puzzled - isn't this just an ordinary romantic sci-fi drama?

They go from roomie beat cops doing believable activities to suddenly flying to Guatemala to take on the cartel. Johns gf the firefighter is continually used as a paramedic on scene for some reason, the whole thing is bizarre. A second year patrol cop works with the fbi cia and so on. Such a shame because it would be an 8/9.

This series was so thought provoking and unbelievably moving.. well acted and have to say Richard Gadd was excellent in the portrayal of himself, and Jessica Gunning was just as awesome as the infatuated stalker.Based on a true story this really showed how brutal and terrifying life can really be.So many awful badly written shows out there at the moment but this really captures the audience. I watched in 2 days and was gutted when it ended.Now I can empathise with all the poor innocent people that have been stalked and the fear that there is no end and no help out there.

The decision to kill her was one of the worst ones atleast me and my friend s stopped watching after her departure.I have a strong feeling that Nathan Fillon fought with her like he did with stana katic in castle. Whatever it was, there was no point of watching it after Zoë Anderson departure because the producer would have come with other similar goof ups later. So my view is , don't give it a try.I will not watch any series of Nathan again because he doesn't get along well on set with fellow actors.	brilliant show till episode number season one powerful character play captain zo anderson decision kill one bad one atleast friend stop watch departure strong feel nathan fillon fight like stana katic castle whatever point watch zo anderson departure producer would come similar goof up later view give try watch series nathan get along well set fellow actor

1	"POTENTIAL SPOILERSI remember the very first time I started watching Game of Thrones. It was different , unexpected plot twists everywhere but it all made sense . The deaths of characters were not a ""shock device"" to be exploited but a plot device to drive the story further into a better ,much unexpected direction.After the show ran out of source material ie. George RR Martin's books the show took a massive hit. The episodes reduced in quality. Characters kept dying off for no reason whatsoever except shock value which to be fair got me maybe once then it became boring. The deaths don't mean anything and the story has gone up in flames due to what I can only assume to be a lack of imagination or lazy writing.The last season which is currently airing kills everything you hold dear (not talking about the characters) , the plot. A villain who was built up from the very first episode of the first season just killed off as a mere foot soldier by someone who we didn't see coming . That's all the show has become a show where anything can happen unless you're a main character. Where people die because it's shocking not because it's good for the plot.Also the show cuts off on story elements to showcase it's CGI. People just travel from place to place like there's a subway in the realm. All while showing it's incredible CGI battles , dragons and wolves which by the way don't really matter as they're just there to look pretty.The show now just kills anyone without any explanation as to why or how. Imagine this - you're flying on a dragon and a guy in a ship shoots 3 perfectly aimed shots on a flying dragon all while behind a rock structure where he cannot be seen yet he can see you. It's a ship not a pebble you can hide behind an island.I feel like the pitch for the last 3 seasons went something like this- ""Hey I know what'd be good. Let's kill some people not major characters thought and even if they do we'll resurrect them then have a couple of battles and viola we have a perfect show with no plot whatsoever""."	potential spoilersi remember first time start watch game throne different unexpected plot twist everywhere make sense death character shock device exploit plot device drive story well much unexpected direction show run source material ie george rr martin book show take massive hit episode reduce quality character keep die reason whatsoever except shock value fair get maybe become bore death mean anything story go flame due assume lack imagination lazy write last season currently air kill everything hold dear talk character plot villain build first episode first season kill mere foot soldier someone see come show become show anything happen unless main character people die shock good plot also show cut story element showcase cgi people travel place place like subway realm show incredible cgi battle dragon wolf way really matter look pretty show kill anyone without explanation imagine fly dragon guy ship shoot perfectly aim shot fly dragon behind rock structure see yet see ship pebble hide behind island feel like pitch last season go something like hey know good let kill people major character think even resurrect couple battle viola perfect show plot whatsoever
1	I was so looking forward to seeing this show because of Colin Farrell and the ratings are high. I've always like Colin Farrell but some of his choices of roles have not been great and I'm beginning to think it may be true once again.I found the first episode to be disappointing. It comes across contrived, things happen way too conveniently for the main character. It comes across as very poorly directed which makes the acting seem poor. Over acting act times.I'll give it a couple more episodes to see if it gets better but I suspect it won't.Even the editing is not good. Full of flashing images and comes across like nits trying too hard to be artsy.I found the first episode to be boring but well see if it picks up.	look forward see show colin farrell rat high always like colin farrell choice role great begin think may true find first episode disappoint come across contrive thing happen way conveniently main character come across poorly direct make act seem poor act act time give couple episode see get well suspect even edit good full flash image come across like nit try hard artsy find first episode bore well see pick
1	I love this show so much that I rewatch the old seasons on repeat. I am a true addict, however I've found myself losing interest over the last several years. It's gotten to the point that I'm praying it ends so that series isn't completely ruined for me...and boy are we close! I'm only still watching at this point because I feel like I've invested too much time not to see it through to the end. Now that they have announced Meredith's reduced role in season 19, I am literally dreading its return in October. Please end this series for the sake of it's fans. There are very few that have stuck around this long and we are nearing our breaking point.	love show much rewatch old season repeat true addict however find lose interest last several year get point pray end series completely ruin boy close still watch point feel like invest much time see end announce meredith reduce role season literally dread return october please end series sake fan stick around long near break point

1	What even is this show anymore? Honestly, I was pretty much done after season 10, but I kept pushing because I was 10 seasons in. With each passing season, I hate this show more. I gave it 5 stars because those first 10 seasons were entertaining. I am currently on season 17, but I can't take it anymore. Major characters are being written off for no reason, constant Hail Marys for the ones I could care less about... it's hard to remain invested. This show is a freaking mess.	even show anymore honestly pretty much do season keep push season pass season hate show give star first season entertain currently season take anymore major character write reason constant hail mary one could care less hard remain invest show freak mess
0	All dialogue and exposition. Anytime a show relies upon a narrator it means the the storyteller is weak and unskilled. Show, don't tell, that's cinema. This show is driven solely by plot and not character, which renders it soleless. If you want to waste your precious time in this world, then watch this show, or use it as a sedative. There's really nothing more to say, but they want more words or characters. Oh yeah, me and the wife couldn't get through the second episode. There is absolutely no cheer in this show. Zero humor, soap opera esq. For sure. It's also obviously try to be a version of Chinatown meets L. A Confidential.	dialogue exposition anytime show rely upon narrator mean storyteller weak unskilled show tell cinema show drive solely plot character render soleless want waste precious time world watch show use sedative really nothing say want word character oh yeah wife get second episode absolutely cheer show zero humor soap opera esq sure also obviously try version chinatown meet l confidential
1	This show was a 10. Then they ran out of source material and the writers ballsed it up. For example, they periodically made people dumb for plot reasons, applied plot armour, made things happen for no reason other than shock value (instead of reasons or decisions or consequences). Also, people started teleporting all over the place, character development was forgotten about, world-building abandoned, plotlines and foreshadowing dumped without reason. Things no longer had to have a reason to occur, only that they be shocking or surprising. The show stopped being about politics, and personal drama, and underhanded actions, and instead became an action show, removing anything that needed any thought, just action and action and shocks, with locations and the politics and personalities being afterthoughts if they were included. Then season 8 happened. Admittedly, everyone involved in season 8 was fantastic, the cast, the crew, every element of the show was beautifully done. Everyone involved in the show for this season should absolutely be proud of their amazing work... Except the script writers. Who were bad at their jobs. Unfortunately, no matter how well made and acted a show is (and it was brilliantly made and acted) if it's in service of an incompetently written script, then the writers do a disservice to everyone else. And the writers truly let down the show by not letting someone competent do the writing. The last season of the show just seemed to be written by lazy writers who just wanted to finish up so they could go ruin Star Wars. I left it as an 8/10, down from the 10/10 it used to be, because every aspect of the show was fantastic, and it was only let down by the writing after there was no more source material to adapt. Plus, hasn't Cersei being pregnant (and it was confirmed in interviews with the show runners that she was) been a thing to try and humanise her for like a year and a half in the show's chronology? She's not even showing yet. Alternatively, if she was only a month or two along and everything in between took place in a month or two, then horses and ships and walking in Westeros must be REALLY fast, and the characters age REALLY fast, considering the amount of travelling that took place between the pregnancy being announced and the end of the show. Especially considering Jamie went from Kings Landing (where the impregnating happened) to High Garden (I think he went there after, but it was a while ago so that might be wrong) to Kings Landing to Winterfell, fought in a war, moved in with Ser Brienne of Tarth, a time jump where they were serious (I think, it wasn't clear), and back to Kings Landing before Cersei had a baby bump.	show run source material writer ball example periodically make people dumb plot reason apply plot armour make thing happen reason shock value instead reason decision consequence also people start teleport place character development forget world build abandon plotlines foreshadow dump without reason thing long reason occur shock surprise show stop politic personal drama underhanded action instead become action show remove anything need think action action shock location politic personality afterthought include season happen admittedly everyone involve season fantastic cast crew every element show beautifully do everyone involve show season absolutely proud amaze work except script writer bad job unfortunately matter well make act show brilliantly make act service incompetently write script writer disservice everyone else writer truly let show let someone competent write last season show seem write lazy writer want finish could go ruin star war leave use every aspect show fantastic let write source material adapt plus cersei pregnant confirm interview show runner thing try humanise like year half show chronology even show yet alternatively month two along everything take place month two horse ship walk westero must really fast character age really fast consider amount travel take place pregnancy announce end show especially consider jamie go king land impregnate happen high garden think go ago might wrong king land winterfell fight war move ser brienne tarth time jump serious think clear back king land cersei baby bump
1	I think that this series has a distinct, non-vulgar story with a factor of mystery and suspense, and it could have been much better than this had it not been for its poor implementation in terms of directing, writing dialogues, and events. I liked the diversity of languages, cultures, and races in this series, and I also liked the merging of realistic science with science fiction, which... It is considered an attractive idea, and they succeeded in combining them together, in addition to moving to the past and representing past events with a wonderful science fiction element. I also liked the characters of Soul Durand, Jack Rooney, Will, and Jin Cheng. This is in addition to good acting, wonderful photography, and very convincing CGI. There is some good comedy for the series and some symbolism For Oppenheimer's film, despite all these advantages, this series is full of many defects that spoil its story. The first of these defects is that some of the dialogues and conversations are boring and do not add any value or depth to the story. There is also the introduction of political agendas in a disgusting way, in addition of the presence of clear writing gaps and laziness. In writing the events and sequences of the story in a convincing way, such as shots of conclusion, analysis, and spying on the main characters without any evidence and without any preparation for these shots. Also, one of the drawbacks of this series is that the character of Auggie is an unpleasant, provocative, petty, and domineering character. I literally hated her appearance and shots. I could not sympathize with her. I was hoping it would end her scene fastly, in addition to the severe weakness in building some of the main characters of the series without adding any depth to these characters, such as the character of Mike Evans, who has illogical and unconvincing motives, as well as Detective Da Shi, who did not appear outside of his work except in literally two shots, while the rest of the series only worked as if he were a secondary character. On the side, there are no logical reasons for some of the events of the series, such as the reason for the Chinese army's attempt to communicate with aliens instead of developing weapons to fight the capitalists, and such as the reason for Yi Wenji's confidence in the San Ti Ren to this degree, and that they are the salvation of humanity, even though they described humans as insects and were the cause of the death of her daughter and her lover. Another disadvantage is that there are bad and very weak triangle love with no emotional addition to the series and very repeatative stories. As for the end of the first part to say the least, it is very unconvincing and bad and did not motivate me at all for the second part.	think series distinct non vulgar story factor mystery suspense could much well poor implementation term direct write dialogue event like diversity language culture race series also like merge realistic science science fiction consider attractive idea succeed combine together addition move past represent past event wonderful science fiction element also like character soul durand jack rooney jin cheng addition good act wonderful photography convince cgi good comedy series symbolism oppenheimer film despite advantage series full many defect spoil story first defect dialogue conversation bore add value depth story also introduction political agenda disgust way addition presence clear write gap laziness write event sequence story convince way shot conclusion analysis spy main character without evidence without preparation shot also one drawback series character auggie unpleasant provocative petty domineer character literally hat appearance shot could sympathize hop would end scene fastly addition severe weakness build main character series without add depth character character mike evans illogical unconvincing motive well detective da shi appear outside work except literally two shot rest series work secondary character side logical reason event series reason chinese army attempt communicate alien instead develop weapon fight capitalist reason yi wenji confidence san ti ren degree salvation humanity even though describe human insect cause death daughter lover another disadvantage bad weak triangle love emotional addition series repeatative story end first part say least unconvincing bad motivate second part
1	I can appreciate that a new television series cannot just instantaneously jump in to their storyline without providing their viewing audience with sufficient background information on the main characters. There are three (3) new rookies who are officers in training, Jackson West (Titus Makin Jr.), Angela Lopez (Alyssa Diaz), and the series main star John Nolan (Nathan Fillion). Each rookie is assigned a more experienced training officer while these rookies are being tested out in the field. As for this first episode, it may start off just a tad slow as we get to know the three (3) rookies but the action heats up in the latter half of the series opener. As with any cop show there are lots of bad dudes with guns, crimes committed and you can expect the good guys to generally get the upper hand on the bad guys.I did not see any Emmy award winning performances but I will say the series is both unrealistic and a whole lot of hokey at the same time. I am optimistic as the series progresses that the show will be more about the variety of its characters than the crimes being committed. For this reason I rate the series a 7 out of 10 and worth a watch for characters being portrayed.	appreciate new television series instantaneously jump storyline without provide view audience sufficient background information main character three new rookie officer train jackson west titus makin jr angela lopez alyssa diaz series main star john nolan nathan fillion rookie assign experience train officer rookie test field first episode may start tad slow get know three rookie action heat latter half series opener cop show lot bad dude gun crime commit expect good guy generally get upper hand bad guy see emmy award win performance say series unrealistic whole lot hokey time optimistic series progress show variety character crime commit reason rate series worth watch character portray

The first Lucy scene opens up with the stupid-plot written all over it. Plot holes, logical things that nobody does because it would break the super thin credibility they want to create with the story. Yayy external visitors! But they all smell, they look bad, their manners are questionable. Nobody raise a question, but then the girl finds out they got radiation on them. So... nobody did a check before? They all had their pipboys on, were they all broken?This is the disney version of fallout, where bad guys are extremely recognisable by the audience so they can scream ""oh nooo watch oooout!"" But I'm too old for this stuff, and that's why I liked the plot in the games: it wasn't straight black and white, it wasn't predictable, it was gritty and adult and always looking in the shades of grey.Modern streaming shows are all like this, and I can't stomach them anymore."	yes fallout yes visual great yes get theme almost right come like every series last year one also horrible writer cliche pre make dialogue scene copypaste show etc etc get annoy first lucy scene open stupid plot write plot hole logical thing nobody would break super thin credibility want create story yayy external visitor smell look bad manner questionable nobody raise question girl find get radiation nobody check pipboy break disney version fallout bad guy extremely recognisable audience scream oh nooo watch oooout old stuff like plot game straight black white predictable gritty adult always look shade grey modern stream show like stomach anymore

But even if you havent played a single fallout game, you can still totally enjoy this series.Great acting, good story, good dialogue, good visuals.Unlike other game adaptations, Halo comes to mind, which was a complete tragedy, Fallout doesnt disappoint.All of these new high quality shows seem to be coming out of prime too, also enjoying watching netflix burn.	honestly suprise good turn even do not play game even idea fallout still enjoy series alot element game video game cliche throw you ve play game you ll get even have not play single fallout game still totally enjoy series great act good story good dialogue good visual unlike game adaptation halo come mind complete tragedy fallout do not disappoint new high quality show seem come prime also enjoy watch netflix burn
1	"The Rookie, the series that introduced us to John Nolan, masterfully portrayed by Nathan Fillion, began its journey with two seasons that captured viewers' attention for their freshness and the magnetic presence of their protagonist. Unfortunately, the third season has undergone a change in tone that, in my personal opinion, has negatively impacted the overall quality of the series.The first two seasons of ""The Rookie"" stood out for their solid storytelling, endearing characters, and the unparalleled charisma of Nathan Fillion. Fillion once again showcased his acting prowess in bringing John Nolan to life, allowing the series to shine and carve out a special place in the hearts of viewers. The on-screen chemistry between Fillion and the rest of the cast was palpable, contributing significantly to the series' success.However, my opinion of the third season differs significantly. The shift towards ""identity politics"" has ruined the viewing experience. I feel that ideological themes have been forced into the plot at the expense of narrative coherence. The series has lost the balance that made it special, deviating from the original police intrigues that characterized it.In my view, Nathan Fillion remains a cornerstone of ""The Rookie."" His performance continues to be exceptional, and his dedication to the character of John Nolan is undeniable. However, even Fillion's talent cannot mask the issues in the third season that have affected the overall quality of the series."	rookie series introduce we john nolan masterfully portray nathan fillion begin journey two season capture viewer attention freshness magnetic presence protagonist unfortunately third season undergo change tone personal opinion negatively impact overall quality series first two season rookie stand solid storytelle endear character unparalleled charisma nathan fillion fillion showcase act prowess bring john nolan life allow series shine carve special place heart viewer screen chemistry fillion rest cast palpable contribute significantly series success however opinion third season differ significantly shift towards identity politic ruin view experience feel ideological theme force plot expense narrative coherence series lose balance make special deviate original police intrigue characterize view nathan fillion remain cornerstone rookie performance continue exceptional dedication character john nolan undeniable however even fillion talent mask issue third season affect overall quality series
0	I was 2 episodes in and I was so close to switching off, I got to episode 5 and finally something happens, I'm thinking here we go it will get better now, but I'm now 7 episodes in and it's still arguably the most boring show I've ever seen, nothing happens, they just constantly talk and talk and talk about aliens coming, but they are 400 years away, well I wish they could turn up and get rid of most of the cast and especially the writers, how can they justify making something so boring?I only watched this because it has Liam Cunningham and Eiza Gonzales but not even they can save it.What an absolute waste.I'd rather be a bug than watch any more of this rubbish.	episode close switch get episode finally something happen think go get well episode still arguably bear show ever see nothing happen constantly talk talk talk alien come year away well wish could turn get rid cast especially writer justify make something bore watch liam cunningham eiza gonzale even save absolute waste rather bug watch rubbish
1	I was looking forward to this but after watching half of the pilot I was starting to wonder how everyone else is giving this 10 stars? I finished and read some online reviews and the endless praising is unwarranted. The Netflix series Marco Polo had one of the highest production costs for it's first season and I was hoping for the same quality here, sadly that's not the case.The writing is simple which is to be expected as it's mostly English subtitles. The musical score is abysmal, the usual background tension drums when anything new or a serious scene is presented. It actually takes away from the scene instead of enhances it. In good television background music goes mostly unnoticed, here it gets annoyingly bad.There are loads of characters which is fine and this pilot is mostly building the world and setting the stage. It's not anything that's out of the ordinary, absolutely amazing storytelling here.The action is minimal and CGI is used to showcase crowd scenes and overhead drone shots.It's 6/10 for the pilot. Maybe a few more shows it'll get better. It's definitely not Marco Polo quality, although it's good enough to keep watching. Perhaps after years of garbage television everyone is just overly excited to watch something decent.	look forward watch half pilot start wonder everyone else give star finish read online review endless praise unwarranted netflix series marco polo one high production cost first season hop quality sadly case write simple expect mostly english subtitle musical score abysmal usual background tension drum anything new serious scene present actually take away scene instead enhance good television background music go mostly unnoticed get annoyingly bad load character fine pilot mostly build world set stage anything ordinary absolutely amaze storytelle action minimal cgi use showcase crowd scene overhead drone shot pilot maybe show get well definitely marco polo quality although good enough keep watch perhaps year garbage television everyone overly excite watch something decent
2	First of all this has got nothing to do with any cute reindeers! The reindeer of the title refers to the pet name stalker Martha gives barman and aspiring comedian Donny when she goes into his pub upset one night and he gives her a cup of tea on the house. It's a kind gesture he will live to regret.I started to watch this following positive reviews and word of mouth and I guarantee that once you start you won't stop until it's finished.Richard Gadd created, wrote and stars in it as Donny and it's based on some of his own experiences. He is a phenomenal talent.Jessica Gunning is terrific as the unhinged Martha who becomes obsessed with Donny and infiltrates every inch of his life. It's like Fatal Attraction on speed!But there is another story going on, one of sexual abuse which Donny suffers at the hands of someone else. An episode is dedicated to showing this and it's not an easy watch.There is a scene near the end of the series where Donny breaks down on stage and decides to bear his soul to the audience. It is one of the most incredible pieces of acting you are likely to see. I'll be very surprised if this doesn't pick up awards.	first get nothing cute reindeer reindeer title refer pet name stalker martha give barman aspire comedian donny go pub upset one night give cup tea house kind gesture live regret start watch follow positive review word mouth guarantee start stop finish richard gadd create write star donny base experience phenomenal talent jessica gun terrific unhinge martha become obsess donny infiltrate every inch life like fatal attraction speed another story go one sexual abuse donny suffer hand someone else episode dedicate show easy watch scene near end series donny break stage decide bear soul audience one incredible piece act likely see surprise pick award

It is not for anyone who isn't into the genre and even then there are way better examples of film noir that are entirely more engaging and enjoyable. It's definitely not a 7.9 in my opinion when there are so many other movies in that review status that are so much better. If you are looking for a time waster to look at some decent ish scenery of Italy and enjoy that period the by all means watch this but if not you will be wishing for the time back.	dialogue terrible child like force cinematography reason star watch take effort really like something bore anyone genre even way well example film noir entirely engage enjoyable definitely opinion many movie review status much well look time waster look decent ish scenery italy enjoy period mean watch wish time back

1	In each new episode, there is a new batch of random conversations between the characters. Only in the last five minutes of the series does any action take place. This leaves you hooked for the following episodes, but in the next episodes there will be the same narrative structure:More conversations between the characters and poor on-screen action in the last few minutes.I've already watched the first seven episodes and any rating that was made close to the series' release date should be redone.I believe that the only episode in which there will really be overwhelming action will be the last.	new episode new batch random conversation character last five minute series action take place leave hook follow episode next episode narrative structure conversation character poor screen action last minute already watch first seven episode rat make close series release date redo believe episode really overwhelm action last

1	What a pleasant surprise. I don't think I've seen a videogame adaptation that just gets the source material like this one. The tone, the world, the characters, this isn't just a show based on Fallout, this IS Fallout. The writing, however, can be hit or miss. The show definitely sticks closer to Bethesda's style of writing with its reliance on flashy high-concept setpieces with little depth to them. It makes the show enjoyable, if a bit repetitive, but ultimately a bit shallow. It also does that annoying thing a lot of bad shows do where there's no sense of geography and the characters just sort of teleport to wherever they need to be. The third episode is undeniably the show's lowest point as the show briefly turns into an unfunny sitcom where nothing happens. I wish we could see more of Hank in the beginning to see what kind of person he is. The characters in general feel somewhat underdeveloped, which is disappointing given how much the show focuses on them. Lucy's arc is sweet even though she comes across as a bit too childish at times, The Ghoul is charismatic as hell and watching his transformation from an idealist who believes in the American dream into a bitter and cynical nihilist is fascinating. Maximus is a great character to represent the Brotherhood because of how much he doesn't fit their ideals. He's a sociopath but instead of being a calculating manipulator he's an incompetent buffoon who's bad at pretty much everything he does, what a fascinating character. Ther whole thing feels a bit like a hyper-violent saturday morning cartoon. The show, however, has plenty of great moments, such as the whole Vault 4 subplot which nicely subverts your expectations, feels like a sidequest in New Vegas. In the second half after a couple of filler episodes the show finally decides to become good again and the ending is just firing on all cilinders. The snake oil salesman might be one of my favorite background characters ever. Can't wait for season 2.	pleasant surprise think see videogame adaptation get source material like one tone world character show base fallout fallout write however hit miss show definitely stick close bethesda style write reliance flashy high concept setpiece little depth make show enjoyable bite repetitive ultimately bite shallow also annoy thing lot bad show sense geography character sort teleport wherever need third episode undeniably show low point show briefly turn unfunny sitcom nothing happen wish could see hank begin see kind person character general feel somewhat underdevelop disappoint give much show focus lucy arc sweet even though come across bite childish time ghoul charismatic hell watch transformation idealist believe american dream bitter cynical nihilist fascinate maximus great character represent brotherhood much fit ideal sociopath instead calculate manipulator incompetent buffoon bad pretty much everything fascinate character ther whole thing feel bite like hyper violent saturday morning cartoon show however plenty great moment whole vault subplot nicely subvert expectation feel like sidequ new vegas second half couple filler episode show finally decide become good end fire cilinder snake oil salesman might one favorite background character ever wait season
2	"This is a good show and has held my interest though it's a bit slow at times and over-wrought with ritual and the relentless threat of suicide. It's like if you spill a cup of coffee you may as well plunge a knife into your gut because you've forever shamed yourself, your entire family and any pets you may have.The character of John Blackthorne who was a hero in the books and the 1980 TV Miniseries has been re-written for the 2020s where we can't have a straight white male being a hero. So he's mainly just a bumbling fool getting by on good luck and the real hero in this one is Mariko, our strong female lead with samurai skillz who is ""ice"" according to her husband. She's not always likable but she's a compelling character acted well.Hiroyuki Sanada (Toranaga) does his usual exceptional acting job and overall this is a great cast playing roles to near perfection. The sets and CGI aerial shots of 1600s Japanese cities are really amazing.There's a lot to like in this series but it also drags at times with the rituals and the attempted tension builds around whether someone will or won't actually commit seppuku, it just gets old after a while.

0	Last chapters have been a complete disaster for me, to see how they have destroyed everything that was built for 8 years is demeaning. It is as if they got bored suddenly and decided to just dropped the house of cards, let's end this now and we couldn't care less. It's incredible how the producers couldn't came up for something more credible for the audience, I think at this stage we don't care any more of the original story, what we need is a good closure and I think it is absolutely lacking at this moment. I have dropped my rating from 10 to 1.	last chapter complete disaster see destroy everything build year demean get bore suddenly decide drop house card let end care less incredible producer come something credible audience think stage care original story need good closure think absolutely lack moment drop rat

1	"For a long while now I've considered this show my favorite series. Season 1-7 were wonderful, full of epic cinematic scenes, inspired acting, and fantastic writing. Season 8 on the other hand, while still possessing the cinematic and acting (for the most part), severely lacks in the writing department. Dan and Dave seemed to have gotten the Disney project and said, ""Game of Thrones who, eh just pump something out quick they'll watch it anyway"". Honestly I would have been okay with the decisions made had there been more story as to why and less foreshadowing and gaps."	long consider show favorite series season wonderful full epic cinematic scene inspire act fantastic write season hand still possess cinematic act part severely lack write department dan dave seem get disney project say game throne eh pump something quick watch anyway honestly would okay decision make story less foreshadow gap
0	"I feel sorry for Nathan Fillion. He played an epic character in an epic TV show (Castle) for seven, long terrific years. But now he is just a clown doing clown things on a clown TV show. They killed his acting career. He deserved better than this. He once played an amazing detective and crime novelist who worked side by side with the woman that he fell in love with at first sight. But now he plays a boring woke guy doing boring things with other boring characters. They literally could have made him the only character of a TV show where all he does is wake up, brush his teeth, go to work, and then go home only to have bad nightmares all night. And that would be more interesting than watching him play as this John Nolan character who was once an interesting cop but is in no way interesting anymore. I mean 10 years from now, people will still remember the name ""Richard Castle"". But no one is going to know who the hell ""John Nolan"" is or even care.Yes, I will admit that I was angry and disgusted with the first five or six episodes of S03 because it was nonstop identity politics. But after the fifth or sixth episode, they stopped with that rhetoric. The problem with the show now is that it is completely boring and definitely not worth watching. And it has been so, so bad for the entire S03, that there is just no way that they can recover from it and save the show and make it good again. Just ""filler"" material of these actors standing, walking, or sitting in their cruisers smiling, laughing, and talking. I'd rather watch grass grow or paint dry. The writers and director completely dropped the ball after S02. I can't see this TV show getting a fourth season, and even if it does, it doesn't change the fact that it should have been cancelled immediately."	feel sorry nathan fillion play epic character epic tv show castle seven long terrific year clown clown thing clown tv show kill act career deserve well play amaze detective crime novelist work side side woman fall love first sight play bore wake guy bore thing bore character literally could make character tv show wake brush tooth go work go home bad nightmare night would interest watch play john nolan character interest cop way interest anymore mean year people still remember name richard castle one go know hell john nolan even care yes admit angry disgust first five six episode nonstop identity politic fifth sixth episode stop rhetoric problem show completely bore definitely worth watch bad entire way recover save show make good filler material actor stand walk sit cruiser smile laugh talk rather watch grass grow paint dry writer director completely drop ball see tv show get fourth season even change fact cancel immediately

I have a big question: Why a civilization advanced as 3 body do not move their planet out of the chaotic 3 body system like we did in ""The Wandering Earth"" to escape dying sun, and find a single star system and enjoy long stable time. The 3-body civilization would not have to reveal themselives to earth and perfectly sovled the 3-body system chaotic problem and remain silent for dark forest law.

Almost every Fan-favorite Characters are Plot Armoured. Characters Are Teleporting here to there. There isn't any tension nor shock events like in Starting seasons.

But instead what I saw was an unimaginably boring 8 episodes with no action except for a few minutes in one episode. No aliens, no action, nothing that made me think real hard or that boggled my mind. I would have turned it off long time ago but someone else wanted to watch it so it was on and I just couldn't believe how boring it was. Almost as boring was watching paint dry, no joke. Now I don't anything about the book, I only know what I saw in the trailer and whoever put that trailer together is a incredible because he took the dullest most boring show I've ever seen and made it look amazing.I am so so disappointed. What was this? What was the point?I hope there is never another awful show like this again.But for those who enjoyed it, I'm happy for you.	see trailer like oh wow look amaze go to see alien invasion time travel thing blow mind make think instead see unimaginably bear episode action except minute one episode alien action nothing make think real hard boggle mind would turn long time ago someone else want watch believe bore almost bore watch paint dry joke anything book know see trailer whoever put trailer together incredible take dull bore show ever see make look amaze disappoint point hope never another awful show like enjoy happy
1	I'm not one to follow a series as it is released. Mainly because of my impatience as a viewer. I get so involved, that I have to fuel the fire all at once. Eight years in the making, the suspense was. Boy, let me tell you, the imagination was surpassed ten fold when I actually started the series. It was a bit slow to begin with, though once it took flight, it soared. The writing, character development, portrayal, and the wonder. Astonishing. Unfortunately, the series stumbled, then tripped. The swan dive was horrifying. Such potential ripped from the very soul of the once beautiful masterpiece. With no effort really. All by just the last two episodes. It pains me to have to leave such a terrible review. A 6/10 is actually a bit courteous. I feel sorry for those that followed from day one with such patience. Maybe reading the books will make something better.	one follow series release mainly impatience viewer get involve fuel fire eight year make suspense boy let tell imagination surpass ten fold actually start series bite slow begin though take flight soar write character development portrayal wonder astonish unfortunately series stumble trip swan dive horrify potential rip soul beautiful masterpiece effort really last two episode pain leave terrible review actually bite courteous feel sorry follow day one patience maybe read book make something well
0	So many have reviewed this so I don't have to go on and on about the entire premise. I do have to say, because I really think it should be said, that there is so much potential here, but it's ruined. The lighting, the directing, the cinematography, the production value, the wardrobe, all so well done. It's beautiful...So why only four stars? It's filled with so many gratuitous sex scenes. Any way you like it: Gay, Lesbian, bi, Straight, Incestuous, sex while murdering... the list goes on and on. I really like sex. I do! I like it in movies and I like it in shows, but this is ridiculous. Almost none of it drives the story. None of it is really necessary at all, but sometimes it's nice to have a nice tasteful love scene. In this case it's a ploy to get ratings. It appears to have worked! My next complaint is about something that they could not have changed as it is part of the story from the books, but this is my review and I can give my opinion (shared by many.) They kill every character that you care about. Then, they introduce some new characters for you to like, and they kill them off. The bad guy wins. That is what they are trying to convey. It may be their prerogative to convey it, but I don't have to watch it. So I don't. I stopped watching. I just couldn't take it any more.The sad part is that there is so much good in this series. I really like the concept of the White Walkers. I like their take on dragons. The whole aesthetic is so well done. The world they have created is quite breathtaking. I just wish I could bring myself to watch it. The story just stinks. Oh well, there are plenty of people that like it so this is just one man's opinion.	many review go entire premise say really think say much potential ruin light direct cinematography production value wardrobe well do beautiful four star fill many gratuitous sex scene way like gay lesbian bi straight incestuous sex murder list go really like sex like movie like show ridiculous almost none drive story none really necessary sometimes nice nice tasteful love scene case ploy get rat appear work next complaint something could change part story book review give opinion share many kill every character care introduce new character like kill bad guy win try convey may prerogative convey watch stop watch take sad part much good series really like concept white walker like take dragon whole aesthetic well do world create quite breathtaking wish could bring watch story stink oh well plenty people like one man opinion
1	I've never read the book or seen 'The Talented Mr Ripley', or any other adaptation, so unlike most reviewers was not familiar with the story. The photography was great although I find filming in monochrome a tad pretentious in an attempt to be 'arty'. Much of the direction appeared to be a homage to Hitchcock and was none the worse for that.I liked the controlled perfomance by Andrew Scott as Tom Ripley, playing the serial killer perfectly and thought all the cast did a fine job. I particularly liked the superior expression on the face of the all knowing cat.So, this is a fine series and I will now watch some different versions to make a comparison. I would have given this a nine, but have to dock a couple of points for not filming the gorgeous Italian scenery in colour.	never read book see talente mr ripley adaptation unlike reviewer familiar story photography great although find film monochrome tad pretentious attempt arty much direction appear homage hitchcock none bad like control perfomance andrew scott tom ripley play serial killer perfectly think cast fine job particularly like superior expression face know cat fine series watch different version make comparison would give nine dock couple point film gorgeous italian scenery colour

You tell me that after he hits Greenleaf somehow he falls overboard, gets hit in the head, the boat leaves and manages to make it out alive? Let's not mention his fear of water, what happened to that?Also the sloppy killing, he probably isn't a killer but this series made everyone look stupid.Marge going from smart, suspicious, relentless to soft, repentful and friendly towards Tom.

0	The show itself is a bit of a feel-good series about a 40-year old man turned cop who gets to (of course) bang a 28 year old from training academy.Naturally the 40 year old is considerate, moral and wise man...... not like 99.9% of the 40 year old divorced men who are generally out of shape, bitter and depressed.The stories are of course typical police stories, but this show sees a lot of super-unrealistic gun-fights and unrealistic situations.	show bite feel good series year old man turn cop get course bang year old train academy naturally year old considerate moral wise man like year old divorce man generally shape bitter depress story course typical police story show see lot super unrealistic gun fight unrealistic situation

0	Dear Dan and Dave,I have long been a huge fan and an avid supporter of Game of Thrones all the way since Season 1, granted I regretfully have not had the joys of reading any of the wonderful George RR Martins books. I have, however spent hundreds of hours exploring the Game of Thrones lore, history of Westeros, fan theories, detailed interviews and everything in-between - It's fair to say I'm a more passion fan than most.I am no Hollywood writer - or in fact any writer for that matter - but I believe I share the opinion of so many GoT fans. I want to start off by saying thank you. Thank you to the visual effects crew, stunt co-ordinators, body doubles, extras, set designers, costume designers, camera men, George RR Martin, directors, the brilliant actors and so many other people behind the scenes of this once all-time great show - Not only have we the fans been incredibly let down, but the people who have put their physical blood, sweat and tears into the show have also had their beautiful hard work defiled.I could go into incredible detail about all the things wrong with this season, some notable events: Jon being exiled for killing Danny who murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent people, Jon's heritage being seemingly not important, the woeful execution of Danny going mad, Bran being king even though he didn't do anything at all, Drogon flying off into the 'sunset', Rhaegal being killed, missing the reaction of Sansa and Arya's when Jon revealed his real parents and most of all for me, no one sticking up for Jon in the meeting with all the powerful lords... He literally killed the woman he loved and saved countless lives in the process and he gets nothing in return, its shameful.With the holes in the show - and there as so many - I think it's a pathetic excuse of an ending. HBO wanted 10 seasons, but foolishly Dan Weiss and David Benioff decided they had enough, they wanted to wrap the show up so they could make mountains of money butchering yet another beloved franchise (Star Wars). I understand that not everything deserves a happy and perfect ending, nor can you please everyone. However, we spent nearly a decade following these wonderful characters, watching them develop and intelligently interact with each other since season 1. The ending to this show will never be forgotten, for the wrong reasons unfortunately. I hope Dan and David come out and apologise to the fans, we are the people that kept the show running, without the fans support there would have been no Game of Thrones on TV at all.The characters deserved better. The whole crew deserved better. The fans deserved better. George deserved better.Regards, A Game of Thrones fanOriginally posted by channelsergeant on Game of Thrones S08E06	dear dan dave long huge fan avid supporter game throne way since season grant regretfully joy read wonderful george rr martin book however spend hundred hour explore game throne lore history westeros fan theory detail interview everything fair say passion fan hollywood writer fact writer matter believe share opinion many get fan want start say thank thank visual effect crew stunt co ordinator body double extra set designers costume designer camera man george rr martin director brilliant actor many people behind scene time great show fan incredibly let people put physical blood sweat tear show also beautiful hard work defile could go incredible detail thing wrong season notable event jon exile kill danny murder hundred thousand innocent people jon heritage seemingly important woeful execution danny go mad bran king even though anything drogon fly sunset rhaegal kill miss reaction sansa arya jon reveal real parent one stick jon meet powerful lord literally kill woman love save countless live process get nothing return shameful hole show many think pathetic excuse end hbo want season foolishly dan weiss david benioff decide enough want wrap show could make mountain money butcher yet another beloved franchise star war understand everything deserve happy perfect end please everyone however spend nearly decade follow wonderful character watch develop intelligently interact since season end show never forget wrong reason unfortunately hope dan david come apologise fan people keep show run without fan support would game throne tv character deserve well whole crew deserve well fan deserve well george deserve well regard game throne fanoriginally post channelsergeant game throne e
2	And book readers, if books are so superior then why every single time you watch and whine? Let dumb adaptations get dumb appreciation.This series isn't without its faults but acting, production, cinematography, sound design is all done great except some janky VFX here and there. Ramin Djwadi's music is good but not as impactful as Westworld and Game of thrones.Some scenes could've been better in chopping room and some things are just exposition. So don't expect a series like Dark. But it's not a 3 or 4 or even 6 for that matter. It's entertaining. Slow burn at times. Acted very well and dialogues are for the most part really well done.Some sequences are executed extremely well and few characters are written well enough to become memorable as well.Here's to the hopeful second season which I can't wait for.	book reader book superior every single time watch whine let dumb adaptation get dumb appreciation series without fault act production cinematography sound design do great except janky vfx ramin djwadi music good impactful westworld game throne scene could well chop room thing exposition expect series like dark even matter entertain slow burn time act well dialogue part really well do sequence execute extremely well character write well enough become memorable well hopeful second season wait
1	During quarantine I decided to binge watch Grey's from season 1 to remind myself why I used to love it. When I reached season 11, I realized that's when it started to annoy me. Amelia Shepard is the most obnoxious character ever while Maggie is the most annoying. And just how many sisters can Meredith possibly have? Kind of a stupid premise. And I would have slapped Bailey senseless years ago. I just lost interest.	quarantine decide binge watch grey season remind use love reach season realize start annoy amelia shepard obnoxious character ever maggie annoy many sister meredith possibly kind stupid premise would slap bailey senseless year ago lose interest
2	I loved watching the first two seasons. The acting and storytelling was perfect but then we have season 3. As of writing this, I have watched 6 or 7 episodes of season 3 and it just keeps getting worse. I believe that racism is a problem but the character portrayed by Brandon Routh is a one dimensional caricature of a stereotypical white male racist cop. Whoever decided that Brandon Routh should play this caricature should have been fired on the spot. The only constantly good thing is Nathan Fillion's character, John Nolan and he is the only reason I'll keep watching this show. Currently there are only 4 seasons available on Netflix in my country and reading some of the other reviews on here. I think I'm gonna need a bottle or two of hard liquor to help me finish watching the show. It's sad that they ruined such an amazing show.	love watch first two season act storytelle perfect season write watch episode season keep get bad believe racism problem character portray brandon routh one dimensional caricature stereotypical white male racist cop whoever decide brandon routh play caricature fire spot constantly good thing nathan fillion character john nolan reason keep watch show currently season available netflix country read review think go to need bottle two hard liquor help finish watch show sad ruin amaze show

Without giving much away, the latter season felt a bit rushed, but certainly there are no loose ends in this unforgettable medieval fantasy series. The warring factions are captivating and all have their own vibe. The original and screenplay writers do a great job of bringing the vibrant universe to life. The acting and direction are top notch. The film score is absolutely cinematic and helps set the scene. The set design and costumes are perfect and all seem real.

2	TLDR: The show is awesome. The music, costuming, and sets are all top notch. The cinematography is breathtaking, the acting: stupendous. The writers have done VERY well with what they were clearly told to do: squeeze a 428,000 word epic into six, one-hour long TV episodes. They did very well and delivered a fantastic Cliffs Notes version of the novel. If the showrunner(s) had allowed them to tell the entire story, I would have given this a 10 instead of an 8.I read Shogun, by James Clavell, because it came highly recommended and because I considered it a challenge: I am not used to reading books that are quite that long. I fell in love with it. It is such a beautiful love letter from a Westerner to Japan. I just wish the show had taken on the monumental task of telling the entire story. One of the reasons the book is so long is that it takes quite a long time for a Westerner to learn the ins and outs of a culture as complicated and nuanced as feudal Japan. It would have been so wonderful to see the entire novel in its rich fullness played out with the level of excellence achieved in this show.	tldr show awesome music costume set top notch cinematography breathtaking act stupendous writer do well clearly tell squeeze word epic six one hour long tv episode well deliver fantastic cliff note version novel showrunner allow tell entire story would give instead read shogun jam clavell come highly recommend consider challenge use read book quite long fall love beautiful love letter westerner japan wish show take monumental task tell entire story one reason book long take quite long time westerner learn in out culture complicate nuance feudal japan would wonderful see entire novel rich fullness play level excellence achieve show
0	Netflix succeeded again in taking those marvelous ideas in the original book, butchered and glued it into a joke.The visual effects team pay unnecessary attention to things like the countdown numbers sparking. Totally screwed up those plots that are frightening by their simplicity. A VLCC cut up like a soap box.And yeah, too many soap opera ingredients are added, too. Huge portion of the show turned up to be some romantic relationship story with colleagues, alteregos (they just have this need to turn a single person into a couple of morons fing with each other) and even the enemies. The power of conflict between the ETO and the human society is greatly dimished, which was the whole point. Writers are just trapped in a mindset of rendering CPC as savage, and keep adding actors whose whole purpose is to be diversity.	netflix succeed take marvelous idea original book butcher glue joke visual effect team pay unnecessary attention thing like countdown number spark totally screw plot frighten simplicity vlcc cut like soap box yeah many soap opera ingredient add huge portion show turn romantic relationship story colleague alterego need turn single person couple moron fe even enemy power conflict eto human society greatly dimishe whole point writer trap mindset render cpc savage keep add actor whose whole purpose diversity
1	Not well spent money $20 million per episode.Huge budget spent on special effects that are sometimes absolutely brilliant but sometimes look like bad sci-fi from the 90s. I don't get a luxurious feeling when I see this series that cost so much to make. It feels more like Emmerdale on steroids or like a bad British crime series.It's not bad but not $20 million per episode good.The series really balances from being an ok Sci-fi to being a single big flop. It's mostly the British feel over the whole production that bothers me. The first 8 episodes haven't been particularly tense either.

Alex leaving was too much. I understand that Justin wanted to leave and I'm guessing that he had things going on in his personal life which made his exit so sudden. I understand that the writers did their best with what they had. I am glad he got a happy ending but Alex would never have done that to Jo. Never. Losing Alex was the last straw for me.

0	Besides the bad characters. The entire premise is dumb. There is no way life let alone an advanced civilization could evolve under such chaotic and destructive conditions Also, why would an advanced civilization that had developed quantum tech and built thousands of spaceships not be able to figure out how to travel faster than light? Also, why would they need to conquer a planet that already has a civilization on it, when even our primitive civilization has been able to detect hundreds of exo-planets that could be suitable for colonization? Another thing is why are the scientist characters so unscientific? They hang around bars all the time and put possible mind controlling helmets on without a second thought? Also, how could an advanced civilization not understand such a basic thing as metaphor in a children's story? D & D strike out again.	besides bad character entire premise dumb way life let alone advance civilization could evolve chaotic destructive condition also would advance civilization develop quantum tech build thousand spaceship able figure travel fast light also would need conquer planet already civilization even primitive civilization able detect hundred exo planet could suitable colonization another thing scientist character unscientific hang around bar time put possible mind control helmet without second think also could advance civilization understand basic thing metaphor child story strike
1	"I have watched every episode of Grey's. I don't believe I have ever reviewed it. It has been an excellent series, as can be noted by its longevity. However, this year, I suddenly was bored by the same old characters and everybody having problems. Of course, there is the obligatory surprise pregnancy - again. Also, ""Meredith Grey,"" (Ellen Pompeo) is 50 years old and it is getting kind of absurd to have her acting like a 20-something, which is what she does. If the writers would work on that one thing - making Meredith a mature adult - it would help me keep my interest in this series. I have nothing against the May-December romance she has going with the young doctor, it's just her mannerisms and sometimes clothing that are over the top.

1	"Once again, I think those critics have ""binged"" the series. Whereas, most of us civilians only got to see the pilot. But, I've still come to the same consensus. Nathan is carrying this show -- if you watch this mediocre show, it's just for him. He's got no support -- everyone is angry with everyone, everyone sends everyone ""mixed signals"". This is just Quantico packaged in an LAPD setting. I'll give it more time, but so far this is all I have to say -- if you like Nathan, keep watching. If you're new to his work...this is not him at his best, don't waste your time. Go watch reruns of Firefly (Serenity) or Castle instead...much better.

0	My wife stopped watching the series midway because she felt it was like a teenage drama, with reactions and actions possibly influenced by hormonal imbalances. But I continued after having 2-3 more drinks. Additionally, the five friends in the series share the common background of attending Oxford, which seems to suggest that only bright minds come from there, a notion rarely seen in reality. The series is so boring; it does not appeal to any science-loving mind nor the general public. It seems like a poorly written series, no doubt crafted by a team also responsible for the worst season of GOT when they faced writing without any book available. Extra 2 stars just for the concept borrowed from the book. Now, I planing to buy the translated version of the book instead and experience its true content.	wife stop watch series midway feel like teenage drama reaction action possibly influence hormonal imbalance continue drink additionally five friend series share common background attend oxford seem suggest bright mind come notion rarely see reality series bore appeal science love mind general public seem like poorly write series doubt craft team also responsible bad season get face write without book available extra star concept borrow book plan buy translate version book instead experience true content

0	But that's about it.I love Andrew Scott but he is too old for this series and doesn't even look like Dickie, which makes the plot even more thinner.I never read the book but I watched the Talented Mr. Ripley movie and compared to that, this series is a letdown despite the total length of 8 episodes and the beautiful set pieces.First of all, despite its length, I never got the chemistry between Dickie and Tom. They never became best friends and Dickie is just... so bland (especially compared to the character played by Jude Law). The highly anticipated boat scene became wtf for me for its sheer stupidity. Maybe if the point was to show how stupid and naive Dickie was, then it worked 100%.Also, there is just some unrealistic / bad followed up scenes. Like Tom got super wet but then he appeared to be very dry in the next scene, or the clean up scenes where you would have thought there would be some implication considering how awful Tom is at cleaning up his own mess, but it never happened.Don't know... I guess I was expecting something more but Tom appeared to win because the writer wrote him to win, not because of his own wit (much like the movie).Oh, music is really good though. And the cat.	love andrew scott old series even look like dickie make plot even thinner never read book watch talente mr ripley movie compare series letdown despite total length episode beautiful set piece first despite length never get chemistry dickie tom never become good friend dickie bland especially compare character play jude law highly anticipate boat scene become wtf sheer stupidity maybe point show stupid naive dickie work also unrealistic bad follow scene like tom get super wet appear dry next scene clean scene would think would implication consider awful tom clean mess never happen know guess expect something tom appear win writer write win wit much like movie oh music really good though cat
2	"At first I thought ""no please, not another cop show"" and I wasn't sure about Nathan Fillion as a cop. But I must say, the directing is spot on, and the writing is refreshing - especially the relationships of the rookies and their T.O's, their relationship with each other, the conflicts they have to deal with, and the use/views of the body cams. Also surprisingly, Fillion is perfect for this part and nails his role, and all other actors were perfectly cast and also are great in their roles. I especially appreciate seeing the various parts of L.A. and the different people/conflicts the LAPD has to deal with - outside and within the force. So far so good, let's hope the writing progresses as good at the pilot was throughout the season. A well deserved 8/10 from me.EDIT: 4/2019 - upped my score from 8 to 9/10... the writing has vastly improved; more realistic (and original) drama, and much less cliched cheese.

1	As someone who has played FO1, 2, 3, and New Vegas, they nailed the tone and world building.As someone who likes actually good writing, this show fell flat on its face. Hard.Oddly enough, the storytelling here was relatively solid. Good characterization. The tone, as mentioned. A nice blend of cartoonish dark humor and grit.But in a rare twist of modern literature, it's the plot that is a problem. The plot became so nonsensical by the end that it wrecked the first half of the series.First, the reveal of how Vault 31/32/33 operate means that Hank must have known of the destruction of 32. Yet he let in the raiders.Second, Moldaver and Hank had history, and he STILL let in the raiders.Third, the show simply handwaves how Moldaver, who had a massive falling out with Vault Tech, somehow survived 200 years.Fourth, Hank nuked - NUKED - a whole city because his wife ran away? A hard pill to swallow... and a bridge to far when you remember he's been in cryo for 200 years and underground his whole life. Snap! Nuke!There plot issues that exist after you sit and think about it. And then there's issues that make you stop in the middle of the show and make you rewatch the foundational pieces to make sure you didn't miss something.Fallout is squarely in the latter category.While there is enough in the show to enjoy the journey, it wants to tell a cohesive story, and it does not. It's not a series of side quests. That brings the show way down in my book.If you can overlook foundational concerns like this, you'll enjoy the show.	someone play fo new vegas nail tone world build someone like actually good write show fall flat face hard oddly enough storytelle relatively solid good characterization tone mention nice blend cartoonish dark humor grit rare twist modern literature plot problem plot become nonsensical end wreck first half series first reveal vault operate mean hank must know destruction yet let raider second moldaver hank history still let raider third show simply handwave moldaver massive fall vault tech somehow survive year fourth hank nuke nuke whole city wife run away hard pill swallow bridge far remember cryo year underground whole life snap nuke plot issue exist sit think issue make stop middle show make rewatch foundational piece make sure miss something fallout squarely latter category enough show enjoy journey want tell cohesive story series side quest bring show way book overlook foundational concern like enjoy show

0	"Almost 90% of this 10-plus hour series was just boring melodramatics and lame nonsense proverbs. Even if you condensed just the best and pertinent parts from all ten episodes, you'd still barely have an enjoyable and fulfilling movie. There would still be more plot holes than bad haircuts and lame dialogue combined.Then to make matters worse, they finish the series off ""explaining"" how the battle was won, instead of showing anything. No big battle, nothing. I was waiting the entire series to see this big revenge war, and all I get is this anticlimactic speech. So in other words, there' too much blah blah, many beautiful scenes that offer zero to little plot advancement, and tons of useless half-explained backstories that added nothing but melodramatics to the already going-nowhere story.I'm baffled how this series is rated so high. Never mind all the fake 10/10 new account reviews, but even on RT - 99% by the critics?! Like seriously, are they that bored and easily amused and have that much time to waste with no reward for the viewers investment? By far this is the most boring, waste of budget and overrated series I have ever seen, and I've seen many flops. It's a very generous 1/10 all going to production values, and some decent cinematography - with the exception of the overly dark/night scenes, where I guess they couldn't find power outlets to plug some set lights on."	almost plus hour series bore melodramatic lame nonsense proverb even condense well pertinent part ten episode still barely enjoyable fulfil movie would still plot hole bad haircut lame dialogue combine make matter bad finish series explain battle instead show anything big battle nothing wait entire series see big revenge war get anticlimactic speech word much blah blah many beautiful scene offer zero little plot advancement ton useless half explain backstorie add nothing melodramatic already go nowhere story baffle series rat high never mind fake new account review even rt critic like seriously bear easily amuse much time waste reward viewer investment far bore waste budget overrate series ever see see many flop generous go production value decent cinematography exception overly dark night scene guess find power outlet plug set light

0	"Standard Netflix series journey here - starts super intriguing and cool and then turns into complete drivel. The film has an interesting and intruigung concept, but its execution feels off and all over the place. So many ""filller"" scenes with no substance or direction, with characters just making small talk instead of moving the story forwards. There were some very good parts, such as the nano fibres tearing the boat apart, but even with this I was questioning why the scientist and the agency would do something that horrific??? Why not just board the boat and try to stop them by force? Or at least try to?? Didn't think the music was that great either. So my end take is that it could have been a great series if the script was better and the director had a clearer vision. I wouldn't waste your time on this, unless you're curious as to how bad Netflix series can be. Would be stunned if this got a second season. Such a shame."	standard netflix series journey start super intrigue cool turn complete drivel film interest intruigung concept execution feel place many filller scene substance direction character make small talk instead move story forward good part nano fibre tear boat apart even question scientist agency would something horrific board boat try stop force least try think music great either end take could great series script well director clear vision waste time unless curious bad netflix series would stun get second season shame
2	A very well made period piece. Loved the cinematography and the frames. Keeps you right on the edge. A beautiful balance of mystery, acting, and art. The choice of making the entire piece in black and white was interesting but I guess it made the period drama more believable. However, the series should be watched with an open mind as it has been shot in 1960s when things were not digital and communication was quite slow.Background score and the settings go well with the storyline. The scenic urban-scapes, the gorgeous architecture, and portrayal of Italy are some of the other strong points of the series. There are a few subtle loopholes but that are overshadowed by an otherwise must watch master piece.	well make period piece love cinematography frame keep right edge beautiful balance mystery act art choice make entire piece black white interest guess make period drama believable however series watch open mind shoot thing digital communication quite slow background score setting go well storyline scenic urban scape gorgeous architecture portrayal italy strong point series subtle loophole overshadow otherwise must watch master piece
1	This had a lot of nostalgic elements from the games, it's music and set. I'm sure a lot of gamers like me would appreciate many parts of the world come to life. The main character is alright, she's full of pep and enthusiasm that would fit a vault dweller. But the ghoul is the main highlight of the show, he very quickly steals everyone else's attention, feels like the first few episodes of the Mandalorian.Maximus however, had so much inconsistencies and later on he acts as if he's written by two different people.. Many parts of the series portrays him as very weak then later on acts like an experienced wastelander... then another episode of him acting all weak and stupid again. His inconsistencies like his disappearing branding and all of a sudden his idiocy was contagious enough to even affect the main character - who was naive the first parts of the series, then experienced, then suddenly back to being silly again. Perhaps the writers had rad poisoning. He is basically like Star Wars' Finn. Boring, uninteresting, I even had to google for the correct spelling of his name, that's how memorable he was.Love interests in the entire series had no chemistry, no love and all business. Remove that and it won't affect the story at all.The season ending was kind of everything I'd expect the series to end, but a bit flat.. there was chaos but I sense no excitement at all, even with the Ghoul appearing. Overall I'd give this a 6.5, it's the Ghoul that saved this series to be honest, I'd watch season 2 if it's just him.	lot nostalgic element game music set sure lot gamer like would appreciate many part world come life main character alright full pep enthusiasm would fit vault dweller ghoul main highlight show quickly steal everyone else attention feel like first episode mandalorian maximus however much inconsistency later act write two different people many part series portray weak later act like experience wastelander another episode act weak stupid inconsistency like disappear brand sudden idiocy contagious enough even affect main character naive first part series experience suddenly back silly perhaps writer rad poison basically like star war finn bore uninteresting even google correct spell name memorable love interest entire series chemistry love business remove affect story season end kind everything expect series end bite flat chaos sense excitement even ghoul appear overall give ghoul save series honest watch season
0	OK If you are reading this i am guessing you are one of those super fans who can't get enough of Game Of Thrones & like wallowing in your appreciation of this despicable sorry excuse for TV Fantasy drama. As you can tell i am not one of you. Game of Thrones has so many good reviews & such glowing praise as to make me wonder if the whole world has fallen asleep or alternatively hooked up to some matrix-like hive mind channelling this drivel through a tube placed carefully up your backside, can so many people be so wrong? well the answer is Yes obviously. To Critique this show in a sour way is tantamount to treason i am sure but i am British & trust me it is OK to voice your opinion in a negative way despite the whole world wanting to spit venomous bile in your eyes. I have like most of you, watched every episode of it & although you will rant that i have a choice not to watch it or to plainly just go away, i, like a lot of people these days like watching TV shows & be they bad or good it is always good to watch the things that everyone is talking about (and talking about, and talking about) so i carry on in the vain hope that one day i'll switch this show on & something will actually happen but instead i get B grade British actors talking about 'The Wall' or saying things like 'Something awful is coming' or 'Let's shag!' & on & on, talking, more talking & waiting & waiting, always waiting for something to happen, has anyone noticed that nothing has happened in this show for the last 2 seasons? oh but there was a big battle! yes there was except we missed most of it as we were watching the women hiding below talking some more. Oh but there was 'The Wedding' yes there was, 5 minutes of action tabbed on the end of one of those lengthy talky episodes (you know the ones) 'wow so radical, killing off some of the main characters in such a ghastly manner, no one has done that before' Give me strength!! Game of thrones is like a really bad carrot, like the ones you always throw away to get a better one in the grocers, and the viewers are like ageing donkeys continually following it around until you are so accustomed to doing it that you just carry on regardless, yes i am one of them, i've been suckered as well!, i admit it but by always tossing out the promise of dragons i persevered anyway & now i am at a point that i am writing a review about it, not because i like the bloody thing more because i am sick of these endless reviews praising it's 'Boldness', it's 'Genius', it's 'Lord of the Rings-ish-ness.' My god people, what version of Lord of the Rings have you seen? the one i watched was majestic, action packed, sad, uplifting, funny & the real definition of Genius. Not this pile of puss spewing troll bile that passes itself off as fantasy, if anything its more like playboy channel soft core porn than epic fantasy, obviously one of the main reasons its so popular. Of course you will tell your girlfriend/boyfriend your watching it for the breathtaking dramatics or epic storytelling (because of course it has both of those..cough..choke!!) So you will go on watching it telling your friends how amazing it is, how shocked you were by it etc etc but deep down you all know the truth, that this is just a low level generic hybrid of The Red Shoe Diaries, Dr Quinn Medicine Woman & the recent crap Conan movie. In years to come this will be joked about, like in one of those TV Shows that reminisce about the 80's or 90's with a headline like 'How 10 million people COULD be wrong' & you'll sit there & laugh to yourself in a sad 'i wasted my youth' type way, you will finally realise after years of trailing after the carrot that nothing is going to happen in this show, you'll be left with one last talky exposition scene (whilst a battle rages on somewhere else, presumably somewhere they can't take the cameras) everybody will sit round the throne & toast with fine wine & grapes, there will be singing & dancing & orgies (of course) and maybe if we are lucky, one of the dragons might take a dump? Seriously if people don't start waking up soon i worry about the world, i mean Reeves & Fishburne are way too famous now to give a toss so save yourselves. There are much better shows out there to obsess over, much better fantasy books to read, much much better fantasy films to watch & certainly way better porn! but of course if watching evil characters twirl their moustaches & cackling behind peoples backs whilst masturbating over incestuous kin doing the Humpty Dumpty is your kind of thing, there is at least one scene like this every couple of episodes so knock yourself out. oh and of course you will get the promise of dragons just at the moment your thinking about switching off & watching re-runs of Breaking Bad instead... awful TV, watch Lord of the Rings again, that might wake you up my Matrix loving friends. Game of Thrones, enjoy your stay of execution but one day your head is going to be lopped off just like the only good actor in your show... By the way if you are thinking i am a Troll, i'm not, Trolls are fictional beasts that usually turn up in decent fantasy shows along with Goblins & Dragons, all of which do not feature prominently in Game of Thrones!	ok read guess one super fan get enough game throne like wallow appreciation despicable sorry excuse tv fantasy drama tell one game throne many good review glow praise make wonder whole world fall asleep alternatively hook matrix like hive mind channel drivel tube place carefully backside many people wrong well answer yes obviously critique show sour way tantamount treason sure british trust ok voice opinion negative way despite whole world want spit venomous bile eye like watch every episode although rant choice watch plainly go away like lot people day like watch tv show bad good always good watch thing everyone talk talk talk carry vain hope one day switch show something actually happen instead get b grade british actor talk wall say thing like something awful come let shag talk talk wait wait always wait something happen anyone notice nothing happen show last season oh big battle yes except miss watch woman hide talk oh we d yes minute action tabbed end one lengthy talky episode know one wow radical kill main character ghastly manner one do give strength game throne like really bad carrot like one always throw away get well one grocer viewer like age donkey continually follow around accustom carry regardless yes one suckere well admit always toss promise dragon persevere anyway point write review like bloody thing sick endless review praise boldness genius lord ring ish ness god people version lord ring see one watch majestic action pack sad uplift funny real definition genius pile puss spew troll bile pass fantasy anything like playboy channel soft core porn epic fantasy obviously one main reason popular course tell girlfriend boyfriend watch breathtake dramatic epic storytelle course cough choke go watch tell friend amaze shock etc etc deep know truth low level generic hybrid red shoe diary dr quinn medicine woman recent crap conan movie year come joke like one tv show reminisce headline like million people could wrong sit laugh sad waste youth type way finally realise year trail carrot nothing go happen show leave one last talky exposition scene whilst battle rag somewhere else presumably somewhere take camera everybody sit round throne toast fine wine grape sing dance orgy course maybe lucky one dragon might take dump seriously people start wake soon worry world mean reeve fishburne way famous give toss save much well show obsess much well fantasy book read much much well fantasy film watch certainly way well porn course watch evil character twirl moustache cackle behind people back whilst masturbate incestuous kin humpty dumpty kind thing least one scene like every couple episode knock oh course get promise dragon moment think switch watch run break bad instead awful tv watch lord ring might wake matrix love friend game throne enjoy stay execution one day head go lop like good actor show way think troll troll fictional beast usually turn decent fantasy show along goblin dragon feature prominently game throne

I mean we get that you want to bring them together as it has been hinted for so long now, but was that (doppelgänger theme) the only way the creators decided to go ahead with?Also, the shoot out in the season finale was not up to The Rookie standard which they have always maintained in previous seasons, I hope season 5 will make us forget the season 4 disappointment.Though season 4 was a mess there were few really nice episodes in it too like in the case of Aaron Thorsen, I am really glad that they finally brought some closure to his friends murder case.Also, I hope the show creators bring the FBI trainee Simone Clark character back again in season 5, she is like a female version of John Nolan. Both in terms of Career decisions & handsomeness ;-)Finally, can't wait for season 5. Hope the show gets back to its original charm again.

1	Shogun is propably most notable book of late James Cavell. In time of it's publishing it was surprisingly well acceptepted even by japanese, by how well it incaptured this mysterious culture. Then comes this atrocity. Understandably some libertties need to be taken when adapting a book into a movie or tv series, but these choises done here, not only they deviate from the source material, they do it in a fashion that makes absolutely no sense. Like no sense at all. Some conversations are made totally redundant for no reason, for instance when Blackthorne explains Netherlands insurrogance against their rightfull sovereign. In a book and in 80's series it was depicted in a way that made sence. And my biggest grievance is Blackthorne. Who in their right mind thought that dead-eyed ding dong like Cosmo Jarvis was a good choice for the lead role. That's totally inexcusable. That man has zero range, he would be better of playing some football hooligan than a 1600-century pilot, whom by should be one of the better educated people in the world. In the book he has his problems coming adjusted with japanese culture but he actually learns, beacuse he's smart. Not only language but culture. And he learns how to navigate the dangerous waters of japanese in house fighting of 1600-century.

0	"I didn't like the 1999 version at first, but as time went on, I came to love it for the pacing, costumes, performances and scenery (to me, Italy is another character of the story). It has become one of those reliable movies that I rewatch when I can't find anything else to put on.So when I saw this was coming out, I was super excited. I could tell it was gonna be different from the original, and that was fine with me. I figured that the story would be strong enough to keep me interested.When I started the first episode, I loved the b&w. But I quickly realized that there's a lot of mood building by way of single closeup shots - for example an ashtray with a lit cigarette would be held for like 10 seconds or falling water during a shower for just as much time. The use of single camera and centering also became tedious for me. Of course there were times where it worked beautifully, but after a while, I really wanted there to be little bit more movement.I can understand why this movie is getting such high reviews - especially if one hasn't seen Hitchcock. But what Hitchcock had were better performances and tighter pacing. While I love me some Adam Scott, he's too old for the role, and my first thought when Johnny Flynn came on the screen was ""They don't look similar at all - at least Matt Damon's hair could mimic Jude Law's. How's this gonna work?"" And then the performances were really underwhelming. Every actor in this is talented, but the director instructed them to give extremely deadpan performances. Lastly, I was really disappointed in the actor who did Freddie Miles. Philip Seymour Hoffman was such a powerhouse that whoever filled the role in this version needed to bring something to it; I'm not talking about her gender, I'm talking about some sort of dark charisma that repelled and compelled. Can't tell if it was direction, her ability or even the script. Probably all of them.So admittedly, I've only fast forwarded through 3 episodes. I will probably fast forward through the rest of it at some point. Based on the extra time spent on mood in the first 3 episodes, this definitely could have been told in four."	like version first time go come love pace costume performance scenery italy another character story become one reliable movie rewatch find anything else put see come super excite could tell go to different original fine figure story would strong enough keep interest start first episode love b w quickly realize lot mood build way single closeup shot example ashtray light cigarette would hold like second fall water shower much time use single camera center also become tedious course time work beautifully really want little bite movement understand movie get high review especially one see hitchcock hitchcock well performance tight pace love adam scott old role first think johnny flynn come screen look similar least matt damon hair could mimic jude law go to work performance really underwhelme every actor talented director instruct give extremely deadpan performance lastly really disappoint actor freddie miles philip seymour hoffman powerhouse whoever fill role version need bring something talk gender talk sort dark charisma repel compel tell direction ability even script probably admittedly fast forward episode probably fast forward rest point base extra time spend mood first episode definitely could tell four

0	The only fact that Scott/Greenleaf/Ripley with only a beard and a wig with long hair tries to deceive the Italian inspector who has seen him 3 or more times, and this works, destroyes the already fragile credibility of the whole structure.Scott is too old and lacks charm. Freddy is incomprehensibly more similar to a woman than to a man and the whole narrative structure suffers from a weak script and a questionable direction.The Americans have many flaws in writing and directing, and one of them is the incredible carelessness in the mise-en-scène.This happens often also in great movies.They simply don't care.	fact scott greenleaf ripley beard wig long hair try deceive italian inspector see time work destroy already fragile credibility whole structure scott old lack charm freddy incomprehensibly similar woman man whole narrative structure suffer weak script questionable direction americans many flaw write direct one incredible carelessness mise en sc ne happen often also great movie simply care
0	The characters are completely unrelated to the original work, the plot is too fast-paced, and there is no shaping of the characters' personalities. All the characters are merely pawns to push the plot forward. Ye Wenjie is a person who is internally wounded and disappointed in humanity. Why would she sleep with different people? American scriptwriters seem unable to understand that there can be emotions other than love between the male and female leads, and they must strengthen the connection between the characters through sexual relations. I suggest that those who have watched the TV series should go read the original work.	character completely unrelated original work plot fast pace shape character personality character merely pawn push plot forward ye wenjie person internally wind disappoint humanity would sleep different people american scriptwriter seem unable understand emotion love male female lead must strengthen connection character sexual relation suggest watch tv series go read original work
1	"First of all I want to say I agree with the reviews about the choice of actors. Why does it always have to be young females (late 20s) who plays leaders of big organisations and departments and brilliant doctors of theoretical physics etc.? Does anyone know how long it takes just to get through the education in university to get the phd degree? And then you need to work many years and publish a lot to become ""someone"" of importance. I'm sure these are supposed to be the most brilliant people on the planet (!) but it's still very unbelievable.Netflix (and others): There are lots of wonderful female actors 40-50+ to play these roles much better and more genuinely.Same goes for the guys mostly.Second, the acting and the personal plot twists are not so interesting, except for Jin's experiences in the game, where she actually develops some insight.However the others' stories seem fleeting and irrelevant. Interesting points fade away (like the numbers seem by one actor in the beginning..).. why? No follow up?Lastly, after the first 3-4 episodes the pace slows down, we now know ""what's coming"" and it gets quite boring with the retrospect parts. I fell asleep actually. I fear this is another one coming to a really bad and unsatisfying ending.. (how can it not?) but will watch the remaining episodes."	first want say agree review choice actor always young female late play leader big organisation department brilliant doctor theoretical physic etc anyone know long take get education university get phd degree need work many year publish lot become someone importance sure suppose brilliant people planet still unbelievable netflix other lot wonderful female actor play role much well genuinely go guy mostly second act personal plot twist interest except jin experience game actually develop insight however other story seem fleet irrelevant interest point fade away like number seem one actor begin follow lastly first episode pace slow know come get quite bore retrospect part fall asleep actually fear another one come really bad unsatisfying end watch remain episode

Horrid interface, lacked good mod support like Oblivion and the endless knives and forks and microwave parts. Oh and it's a personal opinion but I hate the 50s retro sci fi thing.Why do I say this.

2	Baby raindeer is not only about self hate and trauma but about honesty and communication and loneliness. Donny is so difficult to watch in the first episodes because he is painfully dishonest with himself and everyone else, especially when he is performing on stage. (It must have been so incredibly difficult for Dunn to play an old version of himself?!) He becomes more and more likeable as he opens up. Quite opposite to the result he feared. It's easy to hate him until you look at yourself and realise you are open when it comes to most things but you make exceptions for those few things that seem so unspeakable you will never share them. It so happens that he has experienced too many unspeakable things. Gadd is unbelievably, mindblowingly courageous.I also found the observations about the limitations of law to be very interesting. It's scary to know how easily the wave between legal and illegal can be surfed when one is knowledgeable enough. This goes hand in hand with the fact that most of the time, our own mistakes are what stop us from understanding and proving that we are the victim.We often see famous people speaking about their past traumas and we tend to mistakenly assume they must be fine now that they are rich and famous. This is why I am glad the series did not end when the main character obtains success, and that his problems are not magically solved by the achievement of his dreams.I loved little bits and details such as the written texts at the beginning of each episode and the effects on the last scene where he is sitting at the bar. I also loved Teri.	baby raindeer self hate trauma honesty communication loneliness donny difficult watch first episode painfully dishonest everyone else especially perform stage must incredibly difficult dunn play old version become likeable open quite opposite result fear easy hate look realise open come thing make exception thing seem unspeakable never share happen experience many unspeakable thing gadd unbelievably mindblowingly courageous also find observation limitation law interest scary know easily wave legal illegal surf one knowledgeable enough go hand hand fact time mistake stop we understand prove victim often see famous people speak past trauma tend mistakenly assume must fine rich famous glad series end main character obtain success problem magically solve achievement dream love little bit detail write text begin episode effect last scene sit bar also love teri

Its got the writing, the feel, the casting and characters are superb , and I don't often say that about anything. It's a light show that can be very serious because the characters have the depth to pull it off, they get along and are super loyal to each other with out much of the soap opera crap that tries to force a storyline.

A real trip back in time to the old style self-narrated private directive genre. Apple hasn't disappointed and continues its excellent record of releasing excellent limited series like this one. The only negative is in a world of instant gratification, waiting for a whole week for a new episode is torturous! But this is most certainly work the wait. Finally, I also love the embedded black and white clips from old detective movies throughout. It adds to the intrigue for me.	colin farrell simply perfect role vulnerable yet strong serious yet fun mysterious yet open really stellar support cast beautiful scenery la real trip back time old style self narrate private directive genre apple disappoint continue excellent record release excellent limit series like one negative world instant gratification wait whole week new episode torturous certainly work wait finally also love embed black white clip old detective movie throughout add intrigue

And I really wanted to like this.There is just so much nudity that I am not continuing.This show seems to have lots of neat and interesting points to it. But I have seen ENOUGH of women's naked body parts. And I simply cannot stomach any more.Many people obviously don't mind this. But I absolutely hate that what looks like such an interesting show has been cheapened so badly. Some people may call it ""gritty"" and ""realistic."" I find it trashy. You can still imply things are happening without shoving it in your face.I am extremely irked because I simply love fantasy, and the mythical creatures, political situations, and intricate world makes me want to watch this badly.But I don't know if I can get through my disgust. I almost turned it off after seeing yet another de-robing of a woman (the second time with this particular woman) with her pointed parts in plain view, while a man proceeded to take advantage of her while she was crying. I mean, this show can stand on its own without all this stuff and still be successful. What is the point of throwing in this trash? Is titillation to draw in perverted viewer counts worth ruining what could otherwise be a very respectable timeless work? I believe that whoever decided to include this was directly, and absolutely, lowering the value of this work.Anyway, I'm sure many will disagree with me, but I was extremely disappointed.Additionally, yes there was a fair amount of gore. A lovely intestine hanging out of a freshly sliced man, maggots on a de-gutted deer with a closeup of its head and bloated tongue, be-headings with pretty views of the red neck meat. Ugh. It was not as bothersome as my prior complaint, but I don't have too much of a problem with gore. Also it wasn't as frequent.With so many positive ratings, I feel that my viewpoint should be put out there."	really want watch really really want like much nudity continue show seem lot neat interest point see enough woman naked body part simply stomach many people obviously mind absolutely hate look like interest show cheapen badly people may call gritty realistic find trashy still imply thing happen without shove face extremely irk simply love fantasy mythical creature political situation intricate world make want watch badly know get disgust almost turn see yet another de rob woman second time particular woman point part plain view man proceed take advantage cry mean show stand without stuff still successful point throw trash titillation draw pervert viewer count worth ruin could otherwise respectable timeless work believe whoever decide include directly absolutely low value work anyway sure many disagree extremely disappoint additionally yes fair amount gore lovely intestine hang freshly slice man maggot de gutted deer closeup head bloat tongue head pretty view red neck meat ugh bothersome prior complaint much problem gore also frequent many positive rat feel viewpoint put
1	This series was absolutely infuriating to watch. It was a fine line between the main characters full of trauma, zero common sense and low EQ who desperately need help and healing, while watching in disbelief about how stupid and un-insightful some people can be.The characters consist of Donny and Martha, both unhinged, mentally unwell people.Teri, the only likeable character with common sense and helpful strategies.It is dark and depressing series, the 2 characters clearly not seeking any mental health support when it was needed, the people around them not really helping in any way. The feelings of shame and guilt from abuse and having very poor communication skills and low self esteem. A shame and a harsh reality of this is how some people actually live.	series absolutely infuriate watch fine line main character full trauma zero common sense low eq desperately need help heal watch disbelief stupid un insightful people character consist donny martha unhinge mentally unwell people teri likeable character common sense helpful strategy dark depress series character clearly seek mental health support need people around really help way feel shame guilt abuse poor communication skill low self esteem shame harsh reality people actually live
2	The biggest negative for me is that young Tom Ripley from Patricia Highsmith's book - a hero dramatic and naive, charming and destructive, very, very versatile in the virtuoso performance of Matt Damon - turned into just an old and angry loser. Andrew Scott is a talented actor, but where is the charm of youth and passion for life? Here Mr. Ripley is just a nasty petty thief - would you let someone like that into your home? And Dickie Greenleaf sees and understands people (like his father), why then did he trust this man, from whom immediately wanted to stay away?The main thing is that, as a big fan of the text, it seems to me that the image of Ripley in the book is deeper than what is embodied here. He is not just a sociopathic maniac - this is too simple a reading - Tom wants to be loved, wants to escape from the bottom of life (but at what cost...) But I want to watch the series to the end because of the passion of the director and cameraman for this story. And also because of the masterful work of other actors - especially the cruel-eyed Dakota Fanning and the charismatic and, at the same time, annoying Eliot Sumner (although after the incredible performance of Seymour Hoffman, I could not imagine another; but Eliot's Freddy - is super!) The black and white solution is intriguing - I was wondering when color would appear? (and, I admit, I didn't guess right).If we abstract from the book, from the films of Minghella, Wenders, Clement, then the series is a masterpiece - but my experience says that it is the book and the 1999 film that are real masterpieces. But this wonderful series, no, did not reach the level of a masterpiece. While there is a lot of fun to be had in watching it, it is a masterful work.	big negative young tom ripley patricia highsmith book hero dramatic naive charm destructive versatile virtuoso performance matt damon turn old angry loser andrew scott talented actor charm youth passion life mr ripley nasty petty thief would let someone like home dickie greenleaf see understand people like father trust man immediately want stay away main thing big fan text seem image ripley book deeply embody sociopathic maniac simple read tom want love want escape bottom life cost want watch series end passion director cameraman story also masterful work actor especially cruel eye dakota fan charismatic time annoy eliot sumner although incredible performance seymour hoffman could imagine another eliot freddy super black white solution intrigue wonder color would appear admit guess right abstract book film minghella wenders clement series masterpiece experience say book film real masterpiece wonderful series reach level masterpiece lot fun watch masterful work

0	"I cannot express how great this show was in its first 6 seasons. It was, the single best fantasy based show in history and also one of the best written non fantasy shows in history...then, then the source ran dry. With having caught up to the novels the shows ""writers"" had to go to Martin for assistance with where the story was going to go.With season 7, Martin was able to give them just enough information from what he has to give them a decent amount to write with. With season 8, all Martin had to give them was the basics of what he was going to do and oh my GOD have these writers shown that they are terrible on their own.The flaws in Season 8 is so glaring, and stand out in ways that is at times gobsmacking.We know from season 2 that Harrinhall was ""melted"" by dragonfire, and told, specifically that is exactly what happens to stone, when a dragon breathes its fire and it hits it...well, screw that says the writers of Season 8. Now, dragonfire causes stone to explode like it was hit with a missile!This, along with great twists like the queen of dragons just up and ""Forgetting"" that her enemy has a fleet of ships even though she had just be told about them, and that they destroyed her own fleet and killed several of her key allies just months before that so they could kill one of her dragons, from impossible angles.Anyway, I should give the writers some credit in that I have never seen anything remotely like I am seeing right now, with anything else...that almost every single person that I know that loved this show with a passion are now debating on not even watching the finale episode or not.Talk about wrecking a legacy."	express great show first season single good fantasy base show history also one good write non fantasy show history source run dry catch novel show writer go martin assistance story go go season martin able give enough information give decent amount write season martin give basic go oh god writer show terrible flaw season glare stand way time gobsmacke know season harrinhall melt dragonfire tell specifically exactly happen stone dragon breathe fire hit well screw say writer season dragonfire cause stone explode like hit missile along great twist like queen dragon forget enemy fleet ship even though tell destroy fleet kill several key ally month could kill one dragon impossible angle anyway give writer credit never see anything remotely like see right anything else almost every single person know love show passion debate even watch finale episode talk wreck legacy

2	After watching the first episode of this series, I was hooked. The writers are amazing at keeping the audience entertained even after 11 seasons. I still love the show and the all of the characters. The drama isn't too overwhelming because they keep it mixed with events in going on in the hospital. Even though the kill off a lot of characters or send them somewhere else in the middle of no where, you cant stay mad at the show because they know how to always keep you hooked. The relationships between the character also will keep you watching and re-watching. Meredith and Christina's relationship made me wish my friends and I could be that close all the time. When Sandra Oh decided to leave it was the hardest good bye other than when they had the plane crash and killed Meredith's sister. Finally Meredith and Derek's marriage was doomed to happen ever since they first started dating. I always knew they would end up together and they are perfect even when they are fighting with each other. If anyone watches one episode of this show they will be watching for their whole life, especially since I've watched it five times.	watch first episode series hook writer amaze keep audience entertain even season still love show character drama overwhelm keep mix event go hospital even though kill lot character send somewhere else middle can not stay mad show know always keep hook relationship character also keep watch watch meredith christina relationship make wish friend could close time sandra oh decide leave hard good bye plane crash kill meredith sister finally meredith derek marriage doom happen ever since first start date always know would end together perfect even fight anyone watch one episode show watch whole life especially since watch five time

Talia was not back for 2nd season. She was a favorite. Not a fan of the replacement. I think the plots have gotten a little over the top. I doubt a rookie would be in front for a meth lab bust. Patrol, yes. Some of the other crazy stuff, I seriously doubt it but they have to make it exciting. Season 3 I believe ep 5 when he goes to college is the worst. Small class, he is in the minority being white, teacher is black. They all give him a hard time for being a cop. So ridiculous. I'm over it! Enough of sticking BLM into every show on tv. That episode gets 1 star. That is where I'm at atm. Will continue series on Hulu when I'm over this episode.

It's just another drama with people fighting for a kingdom. The most pathetic end to a beloved series.

0	The rookie is the perfect depiction of the frailty of the illusion of societal safety guards, one of them namely the police. In essence it is just another detective show like ncis or law and order with a more hands on approach as the main point of observation being the police officers on ground with the suspects being apprehended.One main thing in common is the illusion of people adhering to protocol and process by the name of the law, removing obvious human flaws that comes with the faultiness of human nature. The police force is just too clean, just too sympathetic and by the book to be ever taken seriously. People knowing what they know about the reality of corruption, discriminatory practices and arbitrariness of police work, it appears to be more fairy tale than reality. Making it worse is how discriminatory and arbitrary sloppy police work is being downplayed while demeaning stereotypes are being praised in favor for policemen. The age of idealization of institutions and its officers is coming to an end as the distribution of information about the malpractice is becoming faster. So this show feels very much outdated while still trying to depict a corrupt institution through rose-tinted glasses.Shows like Brooklyn 99 or ,LA vice shows dealing mainly with police corruption, can be forgiven for that, as one is a parody and the other in essence a gritty character study. But a show of this caliber that tries to sell an idea of an institution instead of trying to tell compelling narratives is just too naive and falls flat in its approach.Not a very good look for nathan fillion who has done very little since firefly to further his acting career besides being the poster boy for american police propaganda.	rookie perfect depiction frailty illusion societal safety guard one namely police essence another detective show like ncis law order hand approach main point observation police officer grind suspect apprehend one main thing common illusion people adhere protocol process name law remove obvious human flaw come faultiness human nature police force clean sympathetic book ever take seriously people know know reality corruption discriminatory practice arbitrariness police work appear fairy tale reality make bad discriminatory arbitrary sloppy police work downplay demean stereotype praise favor policeman age idealization institution officer come end distribution information malpractice become fast show feel much outdate still try depict corrupt institution rise tint glass show like brooklyn la vice show deal mainly police corruption forgive one parody essence gritty character study show caliber try sell idea institution instead try tell compel narratives naive fall flat approach good look nathan fillion do little since firefly act career besides poster boy american police propaganda

Great character development and acting, interesting story lines and just enough action that each episode seems way too short. My only critique is that the two female officers look too much alike and I can't always tell them apart, but that could just be me. Really looking forward to the next episode. Bummer the whole season isn't released at once like Netflix.

0	The Fallout setting is supposed to be a somewhat tongue in cheek 1950s America that just never ended, so well up to the date of the nuclear war in 2077, appliances, cars, homes, clothing, etc. Are like they have been stuck in time for 120 years. The 1950s music is still there, as is the Mom and Pop culture.The intent is to ironically contrast that saccharine existence with the harshness of the apocalypse that arrives.Well ... this series kind of tanks that. The casting is like a commercial for Benneton or a UN diversity program and not 1950s America. None of the hair styles fit. None of the accents fit. None of the word choices fit. It's like the series just ran over to the nearest mall, found a bunch of kids and their parents, and asked them to pretend to be in the Fallout setting. Even the humour is typically straight from the Millennial handbag, with a ton of sarcasm and double entendres.This incongruity with the setting continues with the casting, where Brotherhood of Steel recruits (called Aspirants), some of whom have been training with the Brotherhood as foot soldiers for most of their childhood, look like they haven't done a push up in their lives. They don't look like recruits with years of physical training, they look like their only battles were with controllers in their hands. The notable use of a waifish, almost skeletal actor to play the 'best' Aspirant in the pile, the one chosen for promotion, when that actor looks like they would struggle breaking bread or holding a coffee for any extended length of time is a good example. They clearly cared more about that person's demographic makeup than they did whether they actually looked like what the role demanded.The main character from the vault is effectively a Mary Sue. In the first episode, she spouts her vault resume to convince the leadership of the vault that she's a good candidate for marriage to a man in another vault, something they do to help the bloodlines. She's literally good at everything she does, from hand to hand, to shooting, to science, to people, to bravery, to intelligence ... her only flaw is being naive, and that gets cured out of her quick, so her one real flaw is more or less gone by the end of the first episode.There's a lot of nods to items, people and places in the game, but this is where it gets messy. The absolute and utter retcon of the lore in at least four of the games by this series is, well, unforgivable. An entire faction, probably the most positive and interesting one, is completely wiped off the Earth. It just doesn't exist.I watched long enough to learn that, and then shut it off. It was OK, and moderately entertaining to that point, with the caveats listed above, but if you want me to swallow your casting nonsense and utter disregard for the setting at the same time, that's just not going to happen.I've given it four stars out of deference to the games, but this show isn't really all that good at all. There's a lot of fans who will clearly vote it up because Dogmeat is in it, or the Junk Jet, or a cool cowboy ghoul, but the core jobs of making a compelling story, the writing, the casting, and the sets only see one stand out (the sets). You really need all three.The retcon, though? Unforgiveable. The show runner should honestly be ashamed, after saying time and time again that his show was canon. That was 100% a lie.	fallout set suppose somewhat tongue cheek america never end well date nuclear war appliance car home clothe etc like stick time year music still mom pop culture intent ironically contrast saccharine existence harshness apocalypse arrive well series kind tank cast like commercial benneton un diversity program america none hair style fit none accent fit none word choice fit like series run near mall find bunch kid parent ask pretend fallout set even humour typically straight millennial handbag ton sarcasm double entendre incongruity set continue cast brotherhood steel recruit call aspirant train brotherhood foot soldier childhood look like do push live look like recruit year physical train look like battle controller hand notable use waifish almost skeletal actor play good aspirant pile one choose promotion actor look like would struggle break bread hold coffee extend length time good example clearly care person demographic makeup whether actually look like role demand main character vault effectively mary sue first episode spout vault resume convince leadership vault good candidate marriage man another vault something help bloodline literally good everything hand hand shoot science people bravery intelligence flaw naive get cure quick one real flaw less go end first episode lot nod item people place game get messy absolute utter retcon lore least four game series well unforgivable entire faction probably positive interest one completely wipe earth exist watch long enough learn shut ok moderately entertain point caveat list want swallow cast nonsense utter disregard set time go happen give four star deference game show really good lot fan clearly vote dogmeat junk jet cool cowboy ghoul core job make compel story write cast set see one stand set really need three retcon though unforgiveable show runner honestly ashamed say time time show canon lie
2	Fallout was my most anticipated series of this year, and I'm happy to say it did not disappoint.First of all, it looks spectacular. They absolutely nailed the look and aesthetic of the Fallout universe, and its reliance on more practical effects, rather than overusing CGI like most modern series, really showed.The cast was very good. Ella Purnell was a charismatic lead, and it goes without saying, but you can't go wrong with Walton Goggins.The story was very well written, making the show part of the same continuity of the games, without adapting any game in particular, I think, was a good choice. It truly felt like the writers respected the source material, which unfortunately is a very rare trait in video game adaptations.Following on from the success of The Last of Us, Fallout makes me look forward to the future of video game adaptations, and very excited for the Mass Effect and God of War series Amazon Prime currently have in development, as it is clear that they can make a TV series based on a popular video game series, truly incredible.9/10 - Amazing.	fallout anticipate series year happy say disappoint first look spectacular absolutely nail look aesthetic fallout universe reliance practical effect rather overuse cgi like modern series really show cast good ella purnell charismatic lead go without say go wrong walton goggin story well write make show part continuity game without adapt game particular think good choice truly feel like writer respect source material unfortunately rare trait video game adaptation follow success last we fallout make look forward future video game adaptation excite mass effect god war series amazon prime currently development clear make tv series base popular video game series truly incredible amaze

0	Fallout: Expectations Will FallAdapting movies and shows from video games seems to be a new trend in Hollywood. This can sometimes be confusing for the audience, if the show does not do a decent job at explaining what is happening, such as in the case of Amazon's new show, Fallout. Jonathan Nolan etal, and executive producer, Todd Howard. It stars Ella Purnell from Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.After the apocalypse destroyed the Earth, 200 years ago. A select number of people got to take shelter in vaults (safe from the outside world). However, when Lucy's dad is taken, she decides to go outside to find him.This show may sound like other shows, such as the 100, but unfortunately Fallout is confusing, pointless at times, and a little bazaar.The first couple of minutes of the show were unnecessary. It explained how the apocalypse happened, but the characters that participated in it had nothing to do with the rest of the story. The timeline jumps to the vault survivors 200 years later. The way the show jumps between two plotlines, (the vault dwellers and people on the ground) is very confusing. The show never makes it clear what the ground people are trying to accomplish. Nothing like how the 100, portrayed the sky people and the grounders. Maybe Fallout should have introduced the ground people, only when the storyline had Lucy (Ella Purnell) needing to know of them. The only way I was able to figure out who some of the characters' names were, was by looking them up. The show does a bad job of introducing other people, besides lucy.For a show labeled as a drama, Fallout has some very strange moments. A dog who eats things that most dogs would not, such as people, a robot that does not seem to serve a purpose in the plot, and very odd creatures that attack people on the ground, for no reason. If the robot were helpful and friendly, like the one from Lost in Space, that would have given Fallout a likable creature.The only two characters that make this show, not completely terrible is lucy and Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins), or as I call him, grave dude, since he rose from the dead. Purnell did a good job at portraying Lucy's caring and innocent nature, in a world where all they seem to do is violently fight. This show may have been a little better if it only focused on the adventure Lucy is having to go on to find her dad. If you are looking for Fallout to be another good apocalyptic siFi show, like the 100, your expectations will fall.	fallout expectation falladapte movie show video game seem new trend hollywood sometimes confuse audience show decent job explain happen case amazon new show fallout jonathan nolan etal executive producer todd howard star ella purnell miss peregrine home peculiar child apocalypse destroy earth year ago select number people get take shelter vault safe outside world however lucy dad take decide go outside find show may sound like show unfortunately fallout confuse pointless time little bazaar first couple minute show unnecessary explain apocalypse happen character participate nothing rest story timeline jump vault survivor year later way show jump two plotline vault dweller people grind confuse show never make clear grind people try accomplish nothing like portray sky people grounder maybe fallout introduce grind people storyline lucy ella purnell need know way able figure character name look show bad job introduce people besides lucy show label drama fallout strange moment dog eat thing dog would people robot seem serve purpose plot odd creature attack people grind reason robot helpful friendly like one lose space would give fallout likable creature two character make show completely terrible lucy cooper howard walton goggin call grave dude since rise dead purnell good job portray lucy care innocent nature world seem violently fight show may little well focus adventure lucy go find dad look fallout another good apocalyptic sifi show like expectation fall

Not even mentioned the forced ethnic protagonist.The power armour feels synthetic not real. The CGI is not well designed.The actors done good , but the ambience lacks of POST APOCALYPTIC ADAPTATION (very bright lightning ).Too much bethesda and so little Little black isle style for me.War War never changes... money either.	ron pearlman love fallout world since first game poor adaptation like fallout squeeze lemon plant seed something great capture ambience desolation wasteland even clothe seem brand new trash use location feel real look like plateau set studio even mention force ethnic protagonist power armour feel synthetic real cgi well design actor do good ambience lack post apocalyptic adaptation bright lightning much bethesda little little black isle style war war never change money either

Normally I love any cult or fantasy TV but not this one.There's too many macho long speeches and they get sooooo boring. I had to fast forward a couple. All that male posturing. Yawn! Double yawn. It's like Van Damme in furs, except at least you could laugh at him.I liked some of the younger characters, the dwarf and a couple of the females were okay. But then some old bloke would start gassing on again! To make matters worse every 10 minutes someone mentions the word 'brothel' or 'whore'. What a bunch of happy prostitutes all women are. Gawd even I know that's rubbish and prostitution done out of necessity. Oh, and there's too many characters! I was expecting something amazing because of the rave reviews so many chaps have given this. Sadly no.	good really give good shoot watch episode get feed switch normally love cult fantasy tv one many macho long speech get sooooo bore fast forward couple male posture yawn double yawn like van damme fur except least could laugh like young character dwarf couple female okay old bloke would start gas make matter bad every minute someone mention word brothel whore bunch happy prostitute woman gawd even know rubbish prostitution do necessity oh many character expect something amaze rave review many chap give sadly
0	"The first of Highsmith's novels about psycho Tom Ripley, re-interpreted in a series of sterile, icy vignettes filmed in gorgeous black and white.Probably to save money on the settings, only corners of the locations mentioned are shown (NY, Atrani, Naples, can't see a thing in San Remo, etc...) Since I'm Italian, I found the Italian locations particularly disappointing. The series was shot in cold weather and seeing Dickie and Marge alone on the beach and then bathing in the sea was weird. I never saw an Italian beach (or village) so deserted, not even in winter. It looked like only three people lived in Atrani and Naples was not much better (never seen the city so clean and orderly).As mentioned by others, Andrew Scott is too old to play Ripley, described as a 25 yo in the novel, nor has he the charisma of a psycho, but mostly looks sneery and frozen-faced. Johnny Flynn seems too young to be moving into Tom's circle, and Dakota Fanning doesn't seem to have much of a range, except sulking. Freddy, the elephant in the room - let's say it mercifully - is ""miscast"", a far cry from the malignant but hearty presence of Hoffman in the Minghella movie. However, it's an excellent example of nepotism.Each episode seems crystallized in minimum, emotionless dialogue, from the dreary NY opening to the cold meeting of Tom and Dickie. One wonders why Dickie would invite Tom to stay with him when their relationship boils down to concise, almost surgical sentences about nothing. The ""investigative"" sessions are a joke, even given low investigative standards. The episode of the boat is conveniently forgotten; no appeal such as ""Have you seen this man?"" is made in newspapers about the allegedly ""missing"" Ripley and the Italian authorities never contact the American Embassy to get info about the people involved.All episodes are like Dickie paintings, limp and lifeless, mediocre attempts to produce feelings only an original could evoke, be it film noir, Hitchcock, or the more recent ""Talented Mr. Ripley""."	first highsmith novel psycho tom ripley interpret series sterile icy vignette film gorgeous black white probably save money setting corner location mention show ny atrani naples see thing san remo etc since italian find italian location particularly disappoint series shoot cold weather see dickie marge alone beach bath sea weird never see italian beach village desert even winter look like three people live atrani naple much well never see city clean orderly mention other andrew scott old play ripley describe yo novel charisma psycho mostly look sneery freeze face johnny flynn seem young move tom circle dakota fan seem much range except sulk freddy elephant room let say mercifully miscast far cry malignant hearty presence hoffman minghella movie however excellent example nepotism episode seem crystallize minimum emotionless dialogue dreary ny open cold meet tom dickie one wonder dickie would invite tom stay relationship boil concise almost surgical sentence nothing investigative session joke even give low investigative standard episode boat conveniently forget appeal see man make newspaper allegedly miss ripley italian authority never contact american embassy get info people involve episode like dickie paint limp lifeless mediocre attempt produce feel original could evoke film noir hitchcock recent talente mr ripley

But then it is looks like standard movie about alien threat.I wanted to see more about helmets and games.Show's name is ""3 body problem"", but I actually didn't understand why. Ok, they mention it in the game, ok we all know that this problem doesn't have the solution, we know that aliens come from such system. So, what? Is the fact that we have ""3 chosen ones"" means that in season 2 these 3 will create ""the other 3body problem"" for aliens?If aliens have such a cool technological state, why didn't they come to other planets, but coming to Earth? How were helmets created? Who is finding the cult? (I don't believe that Tatiana is coming from UK to China on her own funds). Will we even see aliens in future? I don't think so btw.

0	This show had so much potential. The previews made it seem like it was full of action but you continue to wait for more action. Some episodes are absolutely boring and just when you think the action is coming it doesn't. It builds up to a final showdown for the series finale and then guess what it doesn't come. Final episode is probably the most boring of the entire show. The storyline is great and the potential was there to be one of the greatest samurai shows or movies ever made but it disappointed. I thought the ending was going to be something like we saw on The Last Samurai but it wasn't. If you looking for a show that is a Drama show with a little action then go for it. But if you want a lot of action pass on it.	show much potential preview make seem like full action continue wait action episode absolutely bore think action come build final showdown series finale guess come final episode probably bear entire show storyline great potential one great samurai show movie ever make disappoint think end go something like see last samurai look show drama show little action go want lot action pass

Normally I would have switched off after the first episode but something kept me watching until the end. It was a very disturbing story based on true life experience and it just left me wondering over and over again why he allowed to to be in that position time and time again and why he went into situations knowing that they were wrong and bad. The stalker definitely needed help as she was bonkers but I think so did he for the things he done and went back to over and over again. I would recommend it but I'm not sure why as it was a strange one to watch and just left me with so many questions.	see much ab series post facebook think watch however expect weird good way normally would switch first episode something keep watch end disturb story base true life experience leave wonder allow position time time go situation know wrong bad stalker definitely need help bonker think thing do go back would recommend sure strange one watch leave many question

So, heres the problem. They already gave away the ending in episode two, unless there's an amazing twist. I'm sure there will be a red herring here or there, but it seems like the son David was a ""client"" of the bad guys and the daughter and the lady from the office were looking into it and that is how the one bad guy in the trunk got killed and the daughter is on the run because she did it or something."	enjoy far think reference shoot mann miami vice colin farrell star hilarious like character like mr rogers irl batman night here problem already give away end episode two unless amaze twist sure red herring seem like son david client bad guy daughter lady office look one bad guy trunk get kill daughter run something

0	I am SO over the sorriness of our 'entertainment' industry. It's becoming a rarity to find productions that elevate the human spirit, instead of bashing it to bits with a sledgehammer. At its core, this series is a celebration of human decay, mental health disorders, self-harm, personal and financial irresponsibility, sexual violence and promiscuity, drug abuse and addiction, poor judgment, social breakdowns, and general ickiness.This is just sickly and gross, as well as wildly demeaning to viewers and actors alike. I can't imagine anyone participating in this that won't need trauma counseling afterward.	sorriness entertainment industry become rarity find production elevate human spirit instead bash bit sledgehammer core series celebration human decay mental health disorder self harm personal financial irresponsibility sexual violence promiscuity drug abuse addiction poor judgment social breakdown general ickiness sickly gross well wildly demean viewer actor alike imagine anyone participate need trauma counsel afterward

That he did not throw Ripley out after this I will never understand.The black and white is beautiful but only style over substance.Its soooo slow, but it adds nothing to the story or the personality of Ripley; just endless stair walking and endless murdering scenes...

0	"Attempt 2.This show is really quite bad, and I'll do my best to explain why this will be the case for both fans of the games and those who haven't played the games.1) Storyline:The first thing we hear at the start of every game is ""War, war never changes"" as the main plot is Communist China goes to nuclear war with 50's America (in an alternate timeline where America has household luxuries and conveniences all powered by nuclear energy). Even their coca-cola drink is called 'nuka-cola'. This extends to robot house servants, vehicles and the U. S. military's soldiers armour, called power armour. The frontline of this war is in Anchorage Alaska where Communist China invades America.Ah but not anymore! The writer's have made the show anti-Capitalist and pro-Communist, there is no Communist China, and war..doesn't happen to need to change, as the writer's suggest the nefarious company 'Vault Tec' alone caused nuclear destruction. So the main plot of the whole game franchise is thrown out of the window and mutated like a glowing one, to not bad mouth daddy Marx. And so we see 50's America as the nukes fall, and evil (redacted) man pushes a (redacted) character to steal his place in the vault (another neo-Marxist theme we will see regularly).The show is set a few decades after the games which if the writer's gave a single eff about would've been good. They could have done a lot of fan service and used a tonne of rich source material to write a compelling storyline and world, but having ignored practically all of the game franchise, this show ignores Obsidian Studio's Fallout New Vegas' existence. The NCR (New California Republic who would've freed and controlled the area in the show, and found the vault dwellers or raiders in the area, are non-existent nor mentioned. Let me repeat, a whole republic complete with armed forces and flag, suddenly doesn't exist. This shows resentment for the source material by the writer's and by Bethesda even who have stated the many plot holes and hugs changes to the games in this show is canonical. Well, ok then.The Brotherhood Of Steel in the franchise are a disciplined military order that aim to find all technology from the old world (from ruins and old buildings etc) and help rebuild the world with order. They are strict, devout to their cause and at times unforgiving. In the show, the BoS are mainly shown as a group of snot nosed liars, thieves, an undisciplined thugs it feels like. One of them is a token neo-Marxist inclusion by the writers I can't elaborate on. Another is the side protagonist Maximus. Maximus is another token character, poorly written, very incompetent (this is a theme we'll touch on soon) and he is written like he is a potato, great job representing POC (not). He can be thought of as budget Finn from the doomed JJ Abram's Star Wars trilogy. In fact, this show has elements in common with that trilogy. And a bizarre obsession on part of the writer's with eugenics that defies reality of 50's America. But the writer's long abandoned any thought.The main protagonist is Lucy, a vault dweller. She is what is known as a Mary Sue character, her father (the overseer of the vault) gets kidnapped by raiders and she takes a knife to the abdomen, but don't worry about this tragic start, Lucy is magically very competent and dangerous, skilled with weapons, physically and mentally strong, she doesn't need no man you misogynist bigot. (Or any compelling backstory or writing from an IQ above lukewarm to explain how she became such a competent and skilled woman despite living a sheltered life in a vault complete with familial interbreeding). Rings Of Power, JJ Abrams Star Wars, Helsing. Some of the worst written female character's from some of the worst movies and TV shows, do have this poor writing style in common. Nothing was learned from great written female role models like Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley.We also see raider's make an appearance, and see again that above mentioned common neo-Marxist theme and one bonus! Certain people in this are always bad, I can not elaborate here. Also all male character's in this are written as beta males, that is to say very incompetent, weak, stupid and relying on other's (strong women). The raider's are perhaps the only competent male characters in the show besides the ghoul played by Goggins. The raiders are dangerous and violent (as they should be) but another sheltered vault dweller who is pregnant and took a knife to the eye, is here to take down all of the raiders with a firearm suddenly. I felt this part will really resonate with heavily pregnant blind women who aspire to be Rambo in spite of basic reality.The tone of the show is far too silly, the franchise is supposed to be at least 80% dark and sombre, and 20% dark humour. These numbers became more equal with Bethesda's Fallout 4. But this show makes everything way too comical and silly, which creates a really light and not so desperate tone. This is meant to be about nuclear war but that aftermath never feels like it's a real problem.2) The dialog:The dialog like the plot for this show, is absolutely terrible, I can't state this more clearly. One scene on episode 5 at around 22 mins between Lucy and Maximus, which has smatterings of once Bolsheviks again, feels like it was written by a rudimentary AI from 2004 that was asked ""write Fallout as though you suffered a heavy concussion and are partly drunk"". Everyone who has seen this clip online seems to have the same thought ""this can't possibly be real, this must have been made by a software or something"".Fight choreography: When Maximus fights the ghoul, the ghoul sounds like he's firing rubber CGI bullets, and Maximus in power armour literally looks like he's being pulled around on a rope, this scene like many other's is cringey and not very immersive, it's hard to take it seriously or even comedically.3) Production:Some of the sets look like they were made in someone's backyard, the CGI or transition to it is very noticeable and at times rough. The BoS power armour looks like plastic cosplay (it's decent, but doesn't look metallic). Goggins as the ghoul looks fairly good, although he isn't supposed to have ears as he's a ghoul. Some of the production looks decent, some of it looks bad or like little care was given.Is there anything good about this show?Goggins as the ghoul, you could get rid of Lucy and Maximus (or make them side character's with little screen tome) and just have his story, and this would have worked or have been more compelling and interesting.Overall, whether you played the games (Obsidian or Bethesda made) or whether you know nothing about this franchise. The best advice I can give, is watch the movie instead that inspired the Fallout franchise. 70's 'A Boy And His Dog'. Tis show was made by the Westworld writer, and if you know anything about that show, it was one of the worst written shows made (although in that show's case, the start was very promising which can't be said of this Fallout show)."	attempt show really quite bad good explain case fan game play game storyline first thing hear start every game war war never change main plot communist china go nuclear war america alternate timeline america household luxuries convenience power nuclear energy even coca cola drink call nuka cola extend robot house servant vehicle u military soldier armour call power armour frontline war anchorage alaska communist china invade america ah anymore writer make show anti capitalist pro communist communist china war happen need change writer suggest nefarious company vault tec alone cause nuclear destruction main plot whole game franchise throw window mutate like glow one bad mouth daddy marx see america nuke fall evil redact man push redact character steal place vault another neo marxist theme see regularly show set decade game writer give single eff would good could do lot fan service use tonne rich source material write compel storyline world ignore practically game franchise show ignore obsidian studio fallout new vegas existence ncr new california republic would free control area show find vault dweller raider area non existent mention let repeat whole republic complete arm force flag suddenly exist show resentment source material writer bethesda even state many plot hole hug change game show canonical well ok brotherhood steel franchise discipline military order aim find technology old world ruin old build etc help rebuild world order strict devout cause time unforgive show bo mainly show group snot nose liars thieve undiscipline thug feel like one token neo marxist inclusion writer elaborate another side protagonist maximus maximus another token character poorly write incompetent theme touch soon write like potato great job represent poc think budget finn doom jj abram star war trilogy fact show element common trilogy bizarre obsession part writer eugenic defy reality america writer long abandon think main protagonist lucy vault dweller know mary sue character father overseer vault get kidnap raider take knife abdoman worry tragic start lucy magically competent dangerous skilled weapon physically mentally strong need man misogynist bigot compel backstory write iq lukewarm explain become competent skilled woman despite live shelter life vault complete familial interbreed ring power jj abrams star war helse bad write female character bad movie tv show poor write style common nothing learn great write female role model like sarah connor ellen ripley also see raider make appearance see mention common neo marxist theme one bonus certain people always bad elaborate also male character write beta male say incompetent weak stupid rely strong woman raider perhaps competent male character show besides ghoul play goggin raider dangerous violent another shelter vault dweller pregnant take knife eye take raider firearm suddenly feel part really resonate heavily pregnant blind woman aspire rambo spite basic reality tone show far silly franchise suppose least dark sombre dark humour number become equal bethesda fallout show make everything way comical silly create really light desperate tone mean nuclear war aftermath never feel like real problem dialog dialog like plot show absolutely terrible state clearly one scene episode around min lucy maximus smatter bolsheviks feel like write rudimentary ai ask write fallout though suffer heavy concussion partly drink everyone see clip online seem think possibly real must make software something fight choreography maximus fight ghoul ghoul sound like fire rubber cgi bullet maximus power armour literally look like pull around rope scene like many cringey immersive hard take seriously even comedically production set look like make someone backyard cgi transition noticeable time rough bos power armour look like plastic cosplay decent look metallic goggin ghoul look fairly good although suppose ear ghoul production look decent look bad like little care give anything good show goggin ghoul could get rid lucy maximus make side character little screen tome story would work compel interest overall whether play game obsidian bethesda make whether know nothing franchise good advice give watch movie instead inspire fallout franchise boy dog tis show make westworld writer know anything show one bad write show make although show case start promise say fallout show

Check Story pushed along by plot device instead of cohesive writing? Check Not sure who to root for?

2	I heard about this and that it was based on an award winning book. It starts in the late 1960s in China and follows the misfortunes of Ye Wenjie who's father is killed by revolutionaries and ends up doing hard labour. But she is a scientist and her talents are spotted and she ends up working in a remote observatory with a radio Dish searching the heavens. One day she sees something on the monitor. Is someone trying to communicate. What she does will effect all of mankind...Move forward to present day and a group of Oxford friends, some with genius IQs, are met with a tragedy when one of them commits suicide. Enter Benedict Wong as a mysterious detective called Clarence with a very British accent and a deadpan delivery. He's brilliant!There are strange headsets that have the power to transport the wearer into three dimensional worlds where they are tasked with solving a problem involving saving a civilization. This goes to places you don't expect and I've only just touched the surface.All of the cast are excellent but Wong, Jess Hong as scientist Jin, and Liam Cunningham as the rich and powerful Thomas Wade with a no nonsense, take no prisoners attitude, are all exceptional.It is mind blowing stuff. I literally watched episode 5 open mouthed. It's cerebral, intelligent, thought provoking and truly unique. I cannot wait for season 2!	hear base award win book start late china follow misfortune ye wenjie father kill revolutionary end hard labour scientist talent spot end work remote observatory radio dish search heaven one day see something monitor someone try communicate effect mankind move forward present day group oxford friends genius iqs meet tragedy one commit suicide enter benedict wong mysterious detective call clarence british accent deadpan delivery brilliant strange headset power transport wearer three dimensional world task solve problem involve save civilization go place expect touch surface cast excellent wong jess hong scientist jin liam cunningham rich powerful thomas wade nonsense take prisoner attitude exceptional mind blow stuff literally watch episode open mouth cerebral intelligent think provoke truly unique wait season
1	I've loved the Fallout universe since the first game. Post-apocalyptic but not quite sci-fi. The show really nailed the scene and supplied a decent plot, but some of the acting and dialogue was just...off, and dry as the wasteland itself. It also tried to inject too much humor - Fallout is a more serious game, but the show keeps trying to make us laugh.I really want to like the show, so we'll see if I can make it through the whole thing. At least they got the general feeling right, from the general item names to the various groups of people. It just seems like they should've hired some better writers.	love fallout universe since first game post apocalyptic quite sci fi show really nail scene supply decent plot act dialogue dry wasteland also try inject much humor fallout serious game show keep try make we laugh really want like show see make whole thing least get general feel right general item name various group people seem like hire well writer
0	The plot has been dumbed down, and is rife with plot holes.The CGI seems like it's from the previous decade, just with filters from the 2020s.The cast seem like they're part of some reality show, just thrown together randomly. The Oxford Five appear to be strangers who just got a one-pager about their own characters, forget their friends.The music was exceedingly disappointing, sounded like someone had given an AI the prompt 'Make Ramin Djawadi type Sci Fi music' and that's what was used for the final version.As far as Sci-fi goes, it has more of Season 4 Westworld vibes, and as far as Benioffs go, Got Season 8 vibes. So the worst of both worlds. Poorly adapted, overfunded, disappointing adaptation of a seminal and gorgeous piece of science fiction.Someone also please show Ramin Djawadi proof instruments beside pianos and orchestral ensemble strings exist. Oh, and that there are octaves below the third octave.I don't think I've posted reviews before but I guess posting how we actually feel about stuff like this is the only way to make sure the same crap doesn't happen again.	plot dumbe rife plot hole cgi seem like previous decade filter cast seem like part reality show throw together randomly oxford five appear stranger get one pager character forget friend music exceedingly disappoint sound like someone give ai prompt make ramin djawadi type sci fi music use final version far sci fi go season westworld vibe far benioff go get season vibe bad world poorly adapt overfunded disappoint adaptation seminal gorgeous piece science fiction someone also please show ramin djawadi proof instrument beside pianos orchestral ensemble string exist oh octave third octave think post review guess post actually feel stuff like way make sure crap happen
0	I'm not sure how are people rating this show so high? Reached episode 4 and the show just turned weird. Couldn't watch it any further. The jokes in the show didn't make me laugh. The only character I liked was Teri. To me the show didn't make much sense in the way it was going. It's awful that this a true story, but it wasn't engaging in any way. I felt like the show gives out a wrong message about how cowardly the main character is and how he didn't have the courage or the wisdom to report the incidents any sooner to the police. Again, I've only watched it upto mid episode 4, so my review is based on that.	sure people rat show high reach episode show turn weird watch joke show make laugh character like teri show make much sense way go awful true story engage way feel like show give wrong message cowardly main character courage wisdom report incident soon police watch upto mid episode review base
0	Sadly just terrible. Big fan of the game series, so my dissapointment is immeasurable since a rendition this bad means it won't be renewed. Amazon is just a plague for IPs and now another one is effected by the blight of bad acting (looking at your smug clueless face Aaron Moten), terrible extras (Filly was a disgrace, on par with the monstrous modern star wars series) and ridiculous choices made by Amazon. People giving this a good review are on serious copium, shilling for amazon or they have lost their mind. I am immeasurably dissapointed and am now going to shoot my dog as a sacrifice to the gods in hope that they will curse Amazon out of existence.	sadly terrible big fan game series dissapointment immeasurable since rendition bad mean renew amazon plague ip another one effect blight bad act look smug clueless face aaron moten terrible extras filly disgrace par monstrous modern star war series ridiculous choice make amazon people give good review serious copium shill amazon lose mind immeasurably dissapointe go shoot dog sacrifice god hope curse amazon existence
1	"I'm not familiar with the original book the show is based on, but after watching the final episode, there was one word that came to my mind: Seinfeld. Or as people call ""the show about nothing"".The reason why is because the title of the show ""Shogun"", doesn't exist in the story. Yes we get a 1 minute sneak peek about Toranaga's intentions, but it's just a plan, a dream. And of course the whole show is about making him the Shogun because the other side is evil, but in order to achieve his goals he sacrifices literally everyone around him.He's not better, actually worse because he doesn't attack his enemies, he just kills off his allies. And of course you won't see any of plotting, the plans, because the story focuses on others, whose lives actually less important than his. The story that would be interesting happens off screen of after the show, that we will never see.It's a huge disappointment, and I'm not saying that because I wanted more action, I just wanted a good story where things happen on screen. Otherwise I could just go and watch Seinfeld."	familiar original book show base watch final episode one word come mind seinfeld people call show nothing reason title show shogun exist story yes get minute sneak peek toranaga intention plan dream course whole show make shogun side evil order achieve goal sacrifice literally everyone around well actually bad attack enemy kill ally course see plot plan story focus other whose live actually less important story would interest happen screen show never see huge disappointment say want action want good story thing happen screen otherwise could go watch seinfeld
1	The conclusion to the First Season cliffhanger had me excited for the Second Season Opener. However, i was completely disappointed by its conclusion as one can be. I expect better writing, not the same old crap from every other show. If you dont expect to get the character to move on from a bad cop, and advance. Then watching this show immediately got old. I expected better...	conclusion first season cliffhanger excite second season opener however completely disappoint conclusion one expect well write old crap every show do not expect get character move bad cop advance watch show immediately get old expect well
2	Till season 7 very likely the best TV show ever made in terms of suspense, character development, plot, effects, acting.... 10/10 with no doubt! But S6E10 is probably the point where you should stop and imagine your own ending. It is guaranteed better and has more character development. Otherwise you may end up rating it down by more than just one and are overcome by disappointment...	till season likely good tv show ever make term suspense character development plot effect act doubt e probably point stop imagine end guarantee well character development otherwise may end rat one overcome disappointment
1	30 min episodes a week for a slow neo-noir is wrong, makes the watching a painful experience. The whole series should have been uploaded at once. I lost interest after the 2nd episode.The acting was solid with a promising plot, but convoluted, boring and difficult to follow.The title implies differrent seasons: Spencer, Richer, Magnum... A better title would he been A sugar rose, or something like that, implying a limited series.For a tv-series the characters should have been better developed. I am sure Chandler and Dashiell Hammett wouldn't have like it.Anyway, if you are curious, wait until the last episode and bing the series in one go. As it is, I don't recommend it.	min episode week slow neo noir wrong make watch painful experience whole series upload lose interest nd episode act solid promise plot convolute bore difficult follow title imply differrent season spencer rich magnum well title would sugar rise something like imply limit series tv series character well develop sure chandler dashiell hammett like anyway curious wait last episode bing series one go recommend
0	"I didn't even have to be told this show is produced by a woman, but I looked it up to verify and sure enough it is. The show is so overtly pro-female/anti-male that you just know an endorsement from Oprah Winfrey will be coming soon. Everything irritating about this show could be summed up into a moment of dialogue from one of its episodes. After constantly berating, belittling and humiliating her roommate George, and never hesitating to make it clear to him that his opinion means nothing to her, Izzie (short for Isobel) asks him in all seriousness, ""Did you feel like I was emasculating you?"" Even more incredulously, she said it with a straight face.""Emasculating"" is the key word in this show. The hospital of this program is populated with women with chips on their shoulders and men who are bastards until these women set them straight. In one particular episode a rape victim is callously dismissed by the surgeons until the intern reminds them that she has a name--the ol' new-girl-teaches-the old-farts compassion trick. Beyond that, the doctors remove from the woman's mouth something which none of them but our heroine, Meredith Grey, can identify : the end of the rapist's penis.I'm not even all that perturbed by the idea of a bitten-off penis, for a rapist would surely get what he deserved, but do you mean to tell me that a room full of MALE DOCTORS couldn't identify a penis while a WOMAN could? Where is this hospital so that we can all avoid it? The program constantly features Izzie wearing next to nothing as she walks around the house she shares with Meredith and George. Improbably, George (whom we can only assume is straight) complains about this, only to prompt her poke her head into the shower while he's there. Meanwhile, there's cocky Alex who mocks her modeling days and she gets even by stripping in front of him. If Izzie is so concerned about being taken seriously by the hospital crowd then why is she so contemptuously undressed in front of George, someone who could be her ally, yet offended by Alex's motivations? I guess you're asking yourself why I watch this show if it bothers me like this, and the answer is that otherwise it can be engaging. I can even overlook that fact it features Patrick Dempsey, an actor I've disdained--pre or post rhinoplasty. It takes place in Seattle, a city in which I once lived and continue to love, so it makes me feel connected to that particular place. This show has all the framework of being a great program, and I don't even mind the chick power stuff adding a little verve. I just wish they'd take it back a few notches and make the males (beyond Dempsey's character) a lot more sympathetic."	even tell show produce woman look verify sure enough show overtly pro female anti male know endorsement oprah winfrey come soon everything irritate show could sum moment dialogue one episode constantly berate belittle humiliate roommate george never hesitate make clear opinion mean nothing izzie short isobel ask seriousness feel like emasculate even incredulously say straight face emasculate key word show hospital program populate woman chip shoulder man bastards woman set straight one particular episode rape victim callously dismiss surgeon intern remind name ol new girl teach old fart compassion trick beyond doctor remove woman mouth something none heroine meredith grey identify end rapist penis even perturb idea bite penis rapist would surely get deserve mean tell room full male doctor identify penis woman could hospital avoid program constantly feature izzie wear next nothing walk around house share meredith george improbably george assume straight complain prompt poke head shower meanwhile cocky alex mock model day get even strip front izzie concern take seriously hospital crowd contemptuously undress front george someone could ally yet offend alex motivation guess ask watch show bother like answer otherwise engage even overlook fact feature patrick dempsey actor disdain pre post rhinoplasty take place seattle city live continue love make feel connect particular place show framework great program even mind chick power stuff add little verve wish take back notch make male beyond dempsey character lot sympathetic
2	"Right, well this series is definitely one that I had been waiting for. And once it was released, I sat down and binged the entire first season.I have been a huge fan of the ""Fallout"" games and have been playing them ever since the very first game was released. So yeah, there definitely was something riding on this series. And it was a franchise that so very much deserved either a movie or series adaptation. So thumbs up to Amazon Prime for bringing this to the audience.The storyline throughout the first eight episodes that was season 1, was a nicely written one. It definitely felt like a storyline and narrative that you would find and expect in the ""Fallout"" universe. So the writers nailed it on the head, because this was entertaining and enjoyable from start to end.They had a great cast ensemble in the series, with some good leading performers and also good support performers. There were a fair amount of familiar faces on the cast list, and Walton Goggins was so nicely cast for the role of Cooper Howard. Needless to say that it was nice to see Aaron Moten portray Maximus, as that character is a core essential character in the lore of the ""Fallout"" universe.The character gallery in ""Fallout"" was good. Lots of interesting and memorable characters.""Fallout"" definitely had that particular post apocalyptic feel and touch to it that we love from the games. And the attention to detail throughout the eight episodes was phenomenal. I will say that the episodes are well-worth sitting down to watch two times; once for the story, then again for observing all the minute details and things from the games that made it into the series.However, the ""Fallout"" series was not all just great things, because it definitely also had its flaw. The series was missing iconic creatures such as super mutants, deathclaws, radscorpions, molerats, centaurs, etc. And I was also disappointed in not seeing the use of laser and plasma weapons in use throughout the series. Sure, you see laser weapons in the relic store, but would be nice to have seen them in use. These creatures and weapons are a big part of the ""Fallout"" universe.The setting and scenes throughout the series are good. Well, for the most parts. There were scenes that were not having that particular ""Fallout"" nuclear post apocalyptic feel to it. Here I am thinking of all the scenes where the wasteland had green plants growing.The wardrobe and props in the series were good. I really liked the costumes and props that you see throughout the series. And who can't help but cheer when you see the power armor for the first time.Regardless, Amazon Prime did a great job in bringing the game franchise to the screen, and I certainly was wholeheartedly entertained throughout the course of all eight episodes. And if you enjoy the games, then you definitely have to sit down and watch this.My rating of the first season of ""Fallout"" lands on an eight out of ten stars."	right well series definitely one wait release sit binge entire first season huge fan fallout game play ever since first game release yeah definitely something rid series franchise much deserve either movie series adaptation thumb amazon prime bring audience storyline throughout first eight episode season nicely write one definitely feel like storyline narrative would find expect fallout universe writer nail head entertain enjoyable start end great cast ensemble series good lead performer also good support performer fair amount familiar face cast list walton goggin nicely cast role cooper howard needle say nice see aaron moten portray maximus character core essential character lore fallout universe character gallery fallout good lot interest memorable character fallout definitely particular post apocalyptic feel touch love game attention detail throughout eight episode phenomenal say episode well worth sit watch two time story observe minute detail thing game make series however fallout series great thing definitely also flaw series miss iconic creature super mutant deathclaw radscorpion molerat centaur etc also disappoint see use laser plasma weapon use throughout series sure see laser weapon relic store would nice see use creature weapon big part fallout universe set scene throughout series good well part scene particular fallout nuclear post apocalyptic feel think scene wasteland green plant grow wardrobe prop series good really like costume prop see throughout series help cheer see power armor first time regardless amazon prime great job bring game franchise screen certainly wholeheartedly entertain throughout course eight episode enjoy game definitely sit watch rat first season fallout land eight ten star

0	Predictable script and pointlessly obscene violence alongside a heavily 'guardians-of-the-galaxified' musical fight scene.When the main character's proposed husband steps into frame all pouty and slightly rough, it was as if they weren't at all trying to hide that something bad was going to happen. Then follows a ridiculous scene where horrendously violent acts, such as the barrel of a gun being inserted into a man's mouth before the raider shooting at others through the hole in his head, go alongside comic relief characters saying 'funny' things while more slow-mo fighting occurs in the background.Following the atmosphere of the games, the soundtrack was always going to be a big part of this and I understand that the mix of violence and quirky humour was a big part of the games. In a live-action format I don't think this comes across in the same way and the scene I've mostly referred to seemed 'marvel-ised' and when I see films/TV following trends it really takes me out of the moment and discourages me from watching further.	predictable script pointlessly obscene violence alongside heavily guardians galaxifie musical fight scene main character propose husband step frame pouty slightly rough try hide something bad go happen follow ridiculous scene horrendously violent act barrel gun insert man mouth raider shoot other hole head go alongside comic relief character say funny thing slow mo fight occur background follow atmosphere game soundtrack always go big part understand mix violence quirky humour big part game live action format think come across way scene mostly refer seem marvel ise see film tv follow trend really take moment discourage watch
1	That was what I did. Seasons 1 to 4 were absolutely magnificent. Engaging plot, intriguing characters, twists you don't see coming but in hindsight spot the breadcrumbs leading up to them. Chemistry! Pacing! Intelligent!Season 5 was a little bit draggy but had its outstanding moments especially Hardhome. Season 6 in my opinion was slightly better and on par with seasons 1 to 4. Season 6 also had the only satisfactory Stark reunion.Season 7 was when they started talking about bigger budgets and better CGI. Honestly, not worth the sacrifice. Daenerys and Jon's love story felt completely unrealistic and played up. The most memorable scene was Danny & co absolute belief they were going to overthrow Cersei... cut to that epic Highgarden scene. So yes, one or two moments but bad taste in your mouth.Season 8 was a goddamn fail. Like every fan can attest to. I saw a comment saying how fans are so ungrateful, asking if we can write any better. Why yes, yes I can. Some flaws : Cersei, wasted. Jaime, wasted. Euron, overdone. Rhaegal (dragon), wasted. Bronn, wasted. Sam, wasted. Ghost, wasted. Sansa, wasted. Gendry, wasted. Varys, wasted and overdone. Sorry, I'm choking up just naming these dreadful characterisations.The music is god tier fantastic, as is directing, props and costumes, as well as acting.	season absolutely magnificent engage plot intrigue character twist see come hindsight spot breadcrumb lead chemistry pace intelligent season little bite draggy outstanding moment especially hardhome season opinion slightly well par season season also satisfactory stark reunion season start talk big budget well cgi honestly worth sacrifice daenery jon love story feel completely unrealistic play memorable scene danny co absolute belief go overthrow cersei cut epic highgarden scene yes one two moment bad taste mouth season goddamn fail like every fan attest see comment say fan ungrateful ask write well yes yes flaw cersei waste jaime waste euron overdo rhaegal dragon waste bronn waste sam waste ghost waste sansa waste gendry waste vary waste overdo sorry choke name dreadful characterisation music god tier fantastic direct prop costume well act

1	"The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, in moody black-and-white; and the use of sound and evocative (creepy, haunting) music is perfect. The acting is great: you can't take your eyes off of Andrew Scott and Johnny Flynn complements him wonderfully; and all the supporting and bit players are fine.... EXCEPT for ""Freddie,"" who is just too creepy to convince anyone that he could possibly be a friend of Dickie's! I still like the Matt Damon movie better. For one thing, eight hours of Ripley is too much, and this version drags in parts (compensated by the cinematography). Matt Damon was a more convincing Ripley as a younger, less calculating sociopath. And the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as ""Freddie"" can never be topped; indeed, this ""Ripley"" version's Freddie apparently doesn't even try. 7 stars gets it for me....for a production of this length, I at least expect to see the characters eat a meal. (Apparently, they just survive on coffee and alcohol.)"	cinematography absolutely gorgeous moody black white use sound evocative creepy haunt music perfect act great take eye andrew scott johnny flynn complement wonderfully support bite player fine except freddie creepy convince anyone could possibly friend dickie still like matt damon movie well one thing eight hour ripley much version drag part compensate cinematography matt damon convince ripley young less calculate sociopath late philip seymour hoffman freddie never top indeed ripley version freddie apparently even try star get production length least expect see character eat meal apparently survive coffee alcohol

1	Ripley starts incredibly strong with fantastic cinematography, mysterious acting, and thought through direction. It has enough substance in that first episode that it would compel audience to binge second episode.And that's where you get acquainted with Netflix level writing. The acting goes down the drain with awkward stares and weird dialogues, not to forget nonsensical plot. It gets so annoying and slow that the episode becomes downright unwatchable.The ambiance, the sets, the camera shots are brilliant. But as what always happens, the writing reflects mediocrity and the show becomes sluggish beyond comprehension.Watching Episode one is highly recommended. Rest, you surely can watch to fix your insomnia.	ripley start incredibly strong fantastic cinematography mysterious act think direction enough substance first episode would compel audience binge second episode get acquaint netflix level write act go drain awkward star weird dialogue forget nonsensical plot get annoy slow episode become downright unwatchable ambiance set camera shot brilliant always happen write reflect mediocrity show become sluggish beyond comprehension watch episode one highly recommend rest surely watch fix insomnia
1	"With his self-portrayal of his own personal disturbance and traumatic experiences in Baby Reindeer, Richard Gadd could be the new face of masochism. He spared no effort in depicting every sordid detail of being victim to rape, harassment and stalking, taking the saying ""airing one's dirty laundry"" to unchartered territory. When have we ever seen a survivor of such grotesque abuse approach the re-enactment of their various traumatic events, by themselves no less, with such unbridled gusto and painstaking detail?In the public meltdown that he enacts in episode 6, Gadd described his love for Teri as being surpassed only by his self-hatred; the result of which, his epically low self-esteem, he attributed as the reason for his repeated returns to his rapist (including towards the story's conclusion), and his continued dependence on Martha and her voice messages for validation even after she had pled guilty and was sentenced to nine months in prison.While it might seem to regular viewers that Gadd has sublimated a deeply distressing period in his life in the mid-2010s into a fearlessly creative and cathartic endeavour that ultimately culminated in this Netflix series, I think the truth is far more sinister. Gadd has finally managed to obtain the fame and approval that he admitted to desperately wanting by publicising and capitalising on his personal trauma. Baby Reindeer is his OnlyFans, with the content being his neuroses, self-loathing, public humiliation and other miscellaneous suffering, and now viewed by millions who are applauding this trauma porn.""Truth is stranger than fiction""; this rings especially true for Gadd and Baby Reindeer. Had this story merely been fictional, it would have been an expertly crafted and enthralling story and character study. As a true story depicted by actors removed from the events, it would have been a difficult but fascinating watch. However, to have Gadd play himself is to watch him intentionally reliving his trauma and potentially retraumatising himself ostensibly because he is still very much enslaved to his special brand of shame. As such, Baby Reindeer is not the product of someone who has overcome their inner demons to finally cultivate a healthy relationship with themselves."	self portrayal personal disturbance traumatic experience baby reindeer richard gadd could new face masochism spar effort depict every sordid detail victim rape harassment stalk take say air one dirty laundry unchartered territory ever see survivor grotesque abuse approach enactment various traumatic event less unbridle gusto painstaking detail public meltdown enact episode gadd describe love teri surpass self hatred result epically low self esteem attribute reason repeat return rapist include towards story conclusion continue dependence martha voice message validation even plead guilty sentence nine month prison might seem regular viewer gadd sublimate deeply distress period life mid fearlessly creative cathartic endeavour ultimately culminate netflix series think truth far sinister gadd finally manage obtain fame approval admit desperately want publicise capitalise personal trauma baby reindeer onlyfan content neurose self loathe public humiliation miscellaneous suffer view million applaud trauma porn truth stranger fiction ring especially true gadd baby reindeer story merely fictional would expertly craft enthral story character study true story depict actor remove event would difficult fascinate watch however gadd play watch intentionally relive trauma potentially retraumatise ostensibly still much enslave special brand shame baby reindeer product someone overcome inner demon finally cultivate healthy relationship

The show is decent, but it's not necessarily the groundbreaking, must-watch experience that some commenters make it out to be.As expected, the series does include representation for the raibow community, with a girls who uses made-up pronouns. However, I was disappointed to see the inclusion of a ""person of short stature"" and other minority characters that felt more like box-checking than genuine, well-developed representation.Overall, the TV series is worth watching if you're interested in the premise and have the time. But if you're looking for a truly exceptional viewing experience, you might be better off playing the original game that inspired the show. It seems to capture the essence of the source material more effectively.d."	tv series receive lot review would encourage take grain salt show decent necessarily groundbreaking must watch experience commenter make expect serie include representation raibow community girl use make pronoun however disappoint see inclusion person short stature minority character feel like box check genuine well develop representation overall tv series worth watch interest premise time look truly exceptional view experience might well play original game inspire show seem capture essence source material effectively
1	Beautifully photographed. I watched and watched but only for the same reason I'd sit through a travel documentary. Unfortunately, the cinematography is the best this production could offer. If not for the earlier and far better adaptation of the Highsmith book, I might have actually liked this series. I don't think it's a casting issue - how could it be with such a brilliant ensemble?, but more an acting direction issue. Andrew Scott (I am a fan, believe me) eventually grew tiresome in his intensity. The range of emotion he is well equipped to convey (fear, tension, delusional, frustration, anger, hopefulness,....) got spun to endless repetition in the series. And ultimately in expressing such range, he forgot to be likeable (or at least a character that drew curious interest in his awkwardness) the way Matt Damon managed to do in the 1999 film. That Marge and Dickie take Damon's Ripley in their circle as a friend was thus believable. This was not the case in this 2024 series. Andrew Scott was too sinister and strange throughout that it made no sense for him to have struck a friendship Marge and Dickie (or anyone for that matter) at all. The sexual tension and attraction between Matt Damon and Jude Law (and Gwyneth Paltrow) was also sadly lost. And the levity and flirtatiousness in Gwyneth's portrayal of Marge was replaced by the more sombre and resultingly boring Dakota Fanning. Well acted overall - the actors did their job, but the director took the characters where they should not have gone. So unexpected that acting direction would be the flaw of this series, given the strong cast.	beautifully photograph watch watch reason sit travel documentary unfortunately cinematography good production could offer early far well adaptation highsmith book might actually like series think cast issue could brilliant ensemble act direction issue andrew scott fan believe eventually grow tiresome intensity range emotion well equip convey fear tension delusional frustration anger hopefulness get spin endless repetition series ultimately express range forget likeable least character draw curious interest awkwardness way matt damon manage film marge dickie take damon ripley circle friend thus believable case series andrew scott sinister strange throughout make sense strike friendship marge dickie anyone matter sexual tension attraction matt damon jude law gwyneth paltrow also sadly lose levity flirtatiousness gwyneth portrayal marge replace sombre resultingly bear dakota fan well act overall actor job director take character go unexpected act direction would flaw series give strong cast

1	Game of Thrones will go down in history as the greatest decline in writing quality of all time.I used to love this show, the story, characters, the sprawling setting. It's one of the first series that really made me care and root for the characters. Even the irredeemably evil ones were still exciting to watch.But that all changed with the final season. Unless you have been living under a rock for the past year, its commonly known that George RR Martin has not released his final book of the franchise. The final two seasons were all HBO original content, and they could maintain the story in passable quality during the seventh season. However, when it came to ending the story it is rushed, anticlimactic, and immeasurably disappointing.Characters started acting stupid, or just entirely unlike themselves. Loved heroes become confusingly insane, they lost all semblance of motivations from past seasons and suddenly became totally different people. The writer's excuse? A new motivation from past seasons is written in to skip development, in other words, retcons galore.The dialogue became inanely simplistic or just repetitive and boring. So little of importance is ever said. Characters just stare off in the distance vacantly, then occasionally they make the most observances that anyone could have inferred on their own. What happened to the complex script full of setups, payoffs, and humanly written characters?The only thing left to do now is scrub the awful ending out of my head by rewatching the past six seasons. Then I'll wait for George RR Martin to release the true ending because this is an absolute disgrace. D&D spit in the faces of millions of GOT fans. The best recommendation I can give this show is to watch the first six seasons (and the seventh if you want to test your patience) then forget about season eight.	game throne go history great decline write quality time use love show story character sprawl set one first series really make care root character even irredeemably evil one still excite watch change final season unless live rock past year commonly know george rr martin release final book franchise final two season hbo original content could maintain story passable quality seventh season however come end story rush anticlimactic immeasurably disappoint character start act stupid entirely unlike love hero become confusingly insane lose semblance motivation past season suddenly become totally different people writer excuse new motivation past season write skip development word retcon galore dialogue become inanely simplistic repetitive bore little importance ever say character stare distance vacantly occasionally make observance anyone could infer happen complex script full setup payoff humanly write character thing leave scrub awful end head rewatche past six season wait george rr martin release true end absolute disgrace spit face million get fan good recommendation give show watch first six season seventh want test patience forget season eight

0	Could have been a great series on feudal Japan based on how much painstaking work they did culturally and visually. Unfortunately, they decided to ruin it all with unnecessary crudity and pornography. Many of the ridiculously crass statements the characters make would not have been uttered by people living that time period, even if they were sailors and soldiers. In terms of its treatment of Christianity, the show has a laughably inaccurate representation of what Christian missionaries would have been like. In fact, the show goes out of its way to have some characters insult Christianity in crass ways, presumably inserted just to appeal to the depraved modern juvenile audience the show is seeking to please. It's the same reason it includes explicit sex scenes. No reason to have them, other than to cater to perverted minds. This show would have been so much better had it been cleaned up like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. Instead, they decided to put one more nail in our culture's coffin.	could great series feudal japan base much painstaking work culturally visually unfortunately decide ruin unnecessary crudity pornography many ridiculously crass statement character make would utter people live time period even sailor soldier term treatment christianity show laughably inaccurate representation christian missionary would like fact show go way character insult christianity crass way presumably insert appeal deprave modern juvenile audience show seek please reason include explicit sex scene reason cater pervert mind show would much well clean like lord ring star war instead decide put one nail culture coffin
2	Where should I start ? Grey's anatomy started out o.k., then it got better, but I stopped watching it after Shepard died. They should have ended it there, but no they are prolonging the story, bringing in new characters. Producers should learn to stop while they still have a good product and not keep going till they make a complete mockery of it (like with Prison break). I used to wake up at 6 a.m. to enjoy my coffee while watching the new episode of Grey's anatomy before going to work, but now I'd prefer watching looney tunes. Initially I had given it a 10, but because of the reasons above I changed my mind and made it into an 8.	start grey anatomy start k get well stop watch shepard die end prolong story bring new character producer learn stop still good product keep go till make complete mockery like prison break use wake enjoy coffee watch new episode grey anatomy go work prefer watch looney tune initially give reason change mind make

2	Season 8 was a disaster, but overall it's still a great series. Stop judging the whole series just because S8 was a disaster. S1-S6 was outstanding, S7 is great and S8 is not what we expected. This is one of the most unforgettable series, first because of it's outstanding seasons and second because of it's finale. It's still worth watching, sadly the series got rushed. People are acting like GoT's only season is S8. People forgot how epic and amazing this series was and they only remember the mistakes and bad things about it. This series doesn't deserve a 1-5 rating, even if the writing for S8 is bad and it got rushed, you can't deny the acting, cinematography, casting, and the music in this series are outstanding.	season disaster overall still great series stop judge whole series disaster outstanding great expect one unforgettable series first outstanding season second finale still worth watch sadly series get rush people act like get season people forget epic amaze series remember mistake bad thing series deserve rat even write bad get rush deny act cinematography cast music series outstanding

2	Greetings from the other side. I don't think I played this game back in 1997, as I was enjoying Ultima Online at that time. Therefore, I came into this without any preconceptions.I really enjoyed this first season, especially Coggins as the ghoul. There were some things that I didn't care for, like all of the old 50s music. It would have been better if they played less of that.The effects were good. The T-60 battle Armour was fun to watch in action. I'd love to try out something like that, as I'm sure we all would. The ghoul character was probably my favorite in this show. He was just so entertaining whenever he was on screen. Ella and Max were well done characters as well.I also enjoyed the various crazy characters that they bumped into during their journey.I'm looking forward to a second season, and totally recommend this series.	greet side think play game back enjoy ultima online time therefore come without preconception really enjoy first season especially coggin ghoul thing care like old music would well play less effect good battle armour fun watch action love try something like sure would ghoul character probably favorite show entertain whenever screen ella max well do character well also enjoy various crazy character bump journey look forward second season totally recommend series
0	"When Castle ended, an idea was floated to kill off Kate Beckett and have Castle, Ryan, and Esposito relocate to California & the LAPD. The Gerald McRaney episode was a pseudo-pilot for the idea. Instead, Castle ended, and we got The Rookie as the Nathan Fillion Cop Show Project.Promos for The Rookie highlighted all the comedic bits of the pilot & first few episodes. After all, comedy is what Fillion fans have come to love & expect, especially fans of Con Man.Instead, we are given a much more serious show that is trying (and failing) to be the next Southland. Instead if following YOUNG fish-out-of-water rookie Ben Mackenzie, we ste following OLD fish-out-of-water rookie Nathan Fillion. But ABC is clearly not interested in giving viewers as gritty a show as Southland. Besides, Southland has already been there, done that. It's just serious enough to give Fillion some DRAMA for his resume, but not gritty enough to be off-putting to Castle fans who are unfamiliar with Fillion outside of Castle.The show still must pay lip service to those fans who expect Comedic Fillion. Every episode begins with self-deprecating comedy moment for our Rookie star. Sadly, it is these comedic moments that make the show suffer from split personality. Is it a fun Nathan Fillion comedy? Or is it a gritty Southland-esque drama? Sadly, it is neither.And what's the deal with writing off Mecedes Mason & bringing in Sarah Shahi? That screams of a struggling show trying to make changes to retain viewers. Or maybe it screams of Fillion's inability to work with female costars??? We all know Fillion & Stana Katic were at odds for a bulk of the series run (prompting some strange storylines & that Gerald McRaney LA episode/pilot). Did something happen between Fillion & Mason that led her being written off? Total supposition on my part, but it's where my mind immediately went.And tonight's episode features Felicia Dey. Whedonverse Stunt Casting!! I mean, I LOVED every time there was a Firefly reference or cast member on Castle. So, while my first reaction is ""YAY! Felicia Dey!! Captin Hammer FTW!"" My second reaction is, ""oh. Stunt casting. The show must be hemorrhaging viewers."" And again, bringing in Whedonverse actors means pulling viewers through the 4th wall, and making the drama less believable.What kind of show do you want to be, Rookie? Southland? Castle? Comedy with Whedonverse Stunt Casting? Make up your mind soon! It has already gone from ""must-see"" to ""that show I watch while I fall asleep & don't really care how it ends."""	castle end idea float kill kate beckett castle ryan esposito relocate california lapd gerald mcraney episode pseudo pilot idea instead castle end get rookie nathan fillion cop show project promos rookie highlight comedic bit pilot first episode comedy fillion fan come love expect especially fan con man instead give much serious show try fail next southland instead follow young fish water rookie ben mackenzie ste follow old fish water rookie nathan fillion abc clearly interest give viewer gritty show southland besides southland already do serious enough give fillion drama resume gritty enough put castle fan unfamiliar fillion outside castle show still must pay lip service fan expect comedic fillion every episode begin self deprecate comedy moment rookie star sadly comedic moment make show suffer split personality fun nathan fillion comedy gritty southland esque drama sadly neither deal write mecedes mason bring sarah shahi scream struggle show try make change retain viewer maybe scream fillion inability work female costar know fillion stana katic odds bulk series run prompt strange storyline gerald mcraney la episode pilot something happen fillion mason lead write total supposition part mind immediately go tonight episode feature felicia dey whedonverse stunt cast mean love every time firefly reference cast member castle first reaction yay felicia dey captin hammer ftw second reaction oh stunt cast show must hemorrhage viewer bring whedonverse actor mean pull viewer th wall make drama less believable kind show want rookie southland castle comedy whedonverse stunt cast make mind soon already go must see show watch fall asleep really care end

0	Definitely a soap opera, so by definition nothing has to be real......this style is strangely addicting ---much more in the realm of entertainment -- also less stressful than some of the other so-called medical shows. Firstly there are rarely nurses in the show. They are the front line interface with the patients once the medical interventions are complete. When have you seen doctors sitting by a patient's bedside for longer than is required for a consultation or intervention. You never see doctors standing outside an emergency department waiting for the ambulance. The ambulance arrives; triage immediately; then physician & medi9cal orders. The list is tooooo long. As for sex --- don't ask; don't tell ---all depends on the hospital culture.	definitely soap opera definition nothing real style strangely addict much realm entertainment also less stressful call medical show firstly rarely nurse show front line interface patient medical intervention complete see doctor sit patient bedside long require consultation intervention never see doctor stand outside emergency department wait ambulance ambulance arrive triage immediately physician medi cal order list tooooo long sex ask tell depend hospital culture

The first several seasons were awesome but as each new one comes out, I find myself getting bored with the non-stop drama. Like, seriously, how much drama can one hospital and it's staff possibly endure? Especially Meredith, one of the main characters in the show in which it's centered around. It's unrealistic. It's starting to get really annoying. It's TOO MUCH DRAMA anymore. Which is sad because it has a wonderful cast and premise but now it's more like a soap opera which I must mention that I detest soap opera's! If they toned down the show and quit making so much unrealistic ""bad"" things happen to the cast members, then I might be still wanting more of the show. However, as I said before, it's ""Drama, drama, drama"" and I cannot take much more of it. Seriously. Twelve seasons already and I think this show should make a graceful exit soon before I pull my hair out."	love love love show since first episode much hook begin give new appreciation doctor first several season awesome new one come find get bore non stop drama like seriously much drama one hospital staff possibly endure especially meredith one main character show center around unrealistic start get really annoy much drama anymore sad wonderful cast premise like soap opera must mention det soap opera tone show quit make much unrealistic bad thing happen cast member might still want show however say drama drama drama take much seriously twelve season already think show make graceful exit soon pull hair
2	"THIS is how you make a video game to movie/tv show series. THIS is how you pander to gamers while appealing to new audiences. THIS is excellent 21st century entertainment.I won't waste time explaining the premise, I'm sure you've gotten the gist by now from other reviews. Just know that it seems like gamer who are fans of the game series (such as myself) are quite happy with it, and that people unfamiliar with the game series (like my wife) are also engrossed with this show.SO MANY REFERENCES to the game makes it fun to watch as a long-time gamer fan. Everything, from junk decor like magazine racks and plastic jack-o-lantern buckets, to power armor, enemies, factions, food, chems, characters, and weapons, is familiar.Sure, it may be a bit overproduced, have some cheesy and weak CGI effects, and contain a lot of the ""modern formula"" in its script and story. Aside from that, it's got everything anyone would want for a riveting sci-fi, action, drama, comedy, horror adventure. Seriously, this show, like the game series, covers all the bases.And oh my goodness, mini fan-gush moment here, but, I was so excited to hear Matt Berry's voice, I was totally not expecting it, and it was an awesome cameo as one of the easily recognizable robots in the universe of Fallout. And let's just say his is not the only shocking and awesome cameo in the series. Fans of shows like Archer might be pleasantly surprised in Episode 6.What's also so cool, is that like the stories you run into in the game, there are a lot of really interesting plots with crazy twists. The vaults may seem more like a paradise than on the surface, but when you dig deep, sometimes, the vaults are scarier than reality under the sun...Fallout has been around for two and half decades, and it's taken them this long to finally come out with a tv/movie adaptation? You know what?

0	While the show has good moments and charactersthat shows a surface level understanding for the lore of the show, it is inexcusable to simply retcon the works of games you never worked on. Bethesda has deemed the arguably best three games in the entire Fallout Series (1, 2, and New Vegas) null and void for a show that nobody will remember in years time whenut inevitably does not get renewed for a second season. Who signed off on this garbage fire that accomplishes nothing more than spitting in the eyes of the loyal fans who have maintained the games Bethesda has abandoned through countless mods and fixes they never bothered to get around to.	show good moment charactersthat show surface level understand lore show inexcusable simply retcon work game never work bethesda deem arguably good three game entire fallout series new vegas null void show nobody remember year time whenut inevitably get renew second season sign garbage fire accomplish nothing spit eye loyal fan maintain game bethesda abandon countless mod fix never bother get around
1	I will make it short: the first five seasons are top-notch, and the show really entertained me during those years. In my opinion, it was always exceptional, the best of the best, and a new milestone in making a TV show. However, both Season 6 and 7 couldn't hold up to the level of the first five seasons. They were mostly made without source material from the book series, and this is very evident in the quality. Nevertheless, they were still okay. But Season 8 is a really bad thing and a steep drop in quality regarding storytelling. It's too blunt, too boring (because it's predictable), and there are too many mistakes that occur. There are just too many mistakes to ignore and not to notice. For example, mysteriously, half of the armies of the allies somehow survived the battle against the Night King and the undead to attack King's Landing. Following the shown battle against the Night King and his hordes, it looked like nobody but a very few survived. Not to mention all those bad strategic choices in battle and in preparation for the battle. Remember, Queen Dany had 8,000 unsullied soldiers only in the beginning - all those battles fought, not many should have been left. Also, the killing of the Night King is a rather poor choice of execution.Anyway, after season 6 gone were the times with many interesting characters, exotic places, and plots upon plots. Therefore, it is a good thing that season 8 was the last and the curtains will be closed for good. Also, I should add that I've lowered my hopes a lot for the upcoming prequel show. I fear we will get something rather ordinary and stupid: hopefully, Mr. Martin provides us with a better finale to his Game of Thrones. Last but not least: After the fall of Cersei and Daenerys, I bet there are enough bold (smaller) houses to deny a Brandon Stark the rule over the Seven Kingdoms. The wheel would not be stopped by his choosing, just a naive ending. All in all, it's a bad and just terrible ending to a - mostly - fantastic show. Last note: I thought I would buy all seasons on DVD, but instead, I sold the ones I already had.Ratings: Season 1 to 4 = 9 Season 5 = 8 Season 6 to 7 = 7 Season 8 = 3.	make short first five season top notch show really entertain year opinion always exceptional well good new milestone make tv show however season hold level first five season mostly make without source material book series evident quality nevertheless still okay season really bad thing steep drop quality regard storytelle blunt bore predictable many mistake occur many mistake ignore notice example mysteriously half army ally somehow survive battle night king undead attack king land follow show battle night king horde look like nobody survive mention bad strategic choice battle preparation battle remember queen dany unsullie soldier begin battle fight many leave also kill night king rather poor choice execution anyway season go time many interest character exotic place plot upon plot therefore good thing season last curtain close good also add low hop lot upcoming prequel show fear get something rather ordinary stupid hopefully mr martin provide we well finale game throne last least fall cersei daenery bet enough bold small house deny brandon stark rule seven kingdom wheel would stop choose naive end bad terrible end mostly fantastic show last note think would buy season dvd instead sell one already rat season season season season
0	And instead, just presents a BLM view of this country. All good people are black, unfairly treated or even incarcerated, they care about their neighborhood, about other people and their feelings, ready to sacrifice themselves for others. White people are responsible, as represented by all white bad guys. It's badly written in some places which lowers its entertainment value, at least for me. Trivializing both police work and our problems it serves no one, exacerbating the very problems it aims to attract attention to in order to solve them. I'd give it a five, but only because I feel generous.	instead present blm view country good people black unfairly treat even incarcerate care neighborhood people feel ready sacrifice other white people responsible represent white bad guy badly write place low entertainment value least trivialize police work problem serve one exacerbate problem aim attract attention order solve give five feel generous
1	OK so this is definitely tongue in cheek hospital action/romance/comedy fare. Not to be confused with the likes of the brilliant House series which ticks all the boxes except the one Greys does best which is to be totally unrealistic in virtually every way. Greys is yet another PC cringeworthy show doing its best to cover every gender type possible for what reason? Brownie points? The first series to show the latest so called gender specific type zyxwv etc etc.... Don't know about you but it's not portrayed as interesting discovery but more like 'yeah I'm non binary so refer to me as they we or them' who gives a rats whatever! Anyway I digress. I enjoyed the first few seasons even putting up with the annoying Meredith Grey but alas as the seasons progressed the writing became more desperate as mentioned and quite silly. Worth a watch if you really have nothing else planned. Would have been a 7 but overall a 5 thanks to later seasons.	ok definitely tongue cheek hospital action romance comedy fare confuse like brilliant house series tick box except one grey well totally unrealistic virtually every way grey yet another pc cringeworthy show good cover every gender type possible reason brownie point first series show late call gender specific type zyxwv etc etc know portray interest discovery like yeah non binary refer give rat whatever anyway digress enjoy first season even put annoy meredith grey alas season progress write become desperate mention quite silly worth watch really nothing else plan would overall thank later season

1	I have decided to watch this series because I recently heard various good opinions about the show. I'd like to believe that I watched it so you don't have to.In all honestly, it's based on some quite interesting plot: humans make contact with an alien species which then heads to Earth to colonize it. So what would humans do now?However, the rest is lacking on all levels. The dialogs are childish, the characters are dry - there's no connection with anyone, the story is rushed, the end... well, I won't say anything about the end in case you still want to see it.The only think this series excels at is diversity. Netflix outdone itself in this area.

1	For a series with such a complexity, many-layered characters, contradicted emotions & breathtaking events. you'd expect to get an epic ending but that wasn't the case with Game of Thrones which has an end that ruined it all & made rewatchability almost impossible. even the worst pessimists wouldn't ever imagined a series that acquired all this glory & hype to end up so terribly.Shame on the writers to turn such a rich world & complicated structure into a pale & dumb pop-ish work at the last 2 seasonsSeasons 1-6 outstanding. season 7 that's when the dumb writing has begun. season 8 dumb writing has taken a whole new level, butchering all characters arcs & betraying the previous complexity of the world.if you're new to the series do yourself a favor & stop watching after season 6.	series complexity many layer character contradict emotion breathtake event expect get epic end case game throne end ruin make rewatchability almost impossible even bad pessimist ever imagine series acquire glory hype end terribly shame writer turn rich world complicate structure pale dumb pop ish work last seasonsseason outstanding season dumb write begin season dumb write take whole new level butcher character arc betray previous complexity world new series favor stop watch season
2	A brllliantly shot series - each scene is the work of an artist. Indeed, the cinmetography is a treat, each shot composed beautifully. Even though in black and white, it beautifully captures Italy's beauty.The story moves hauntingly, never letting up on suspense. There is some criticism that the series is too long - after all, others have told the same story in a far shorter movie. I haven't seen the other 'Ripley' movies and thus cannot compare this version with the previous ones. To me, except for a short flashback of Rome in early 1600s, nothing appeared unnecessarily dragged out.Each of the actors gave a fine account of themselves, and Andrew Scottt's performance stands out.	brllliantly shoot series scene work artist indeed cinmetography treat shoot compose beautifully even though black white beautifully capture italy beauty story move hauntingly never let suspense criticism series long other tell story far short movie see ripley movie thus compare version previous one except short flashback rome early nothing appear unnecessarily drag actor give fine account andrew scottt performance stand
0	Really wanted to sympathise with the lead character..suppressed trauma can obviously make people act in very odd ways, not to mention skew, their deciding-making terribly. This guy..just lurches from one awful judgement-call to another.And just when you think he's found some kind of closure at the end of what can only be described as an awful ordeal which he had done so much to perpetuate with his appalling decision-making (or lack of), he goes back to the flat where he was raped and sits and chats with the man who raped him as if they're old friends. Then leaves and decides to listen to some of the voicemails his tormentor left him before she was jailed. This woman who had ruined his life. Smiling nostalgically as he does so.He's almost impossible to like.And considering he wants to make a living from comedy he's about as funny as toothache.A well-made series but it's rare I find myself feeling so antagonistic toward a character who has endured so much.	really want sympathise lead character suppress trauma obviously make people act odd way mention skew decide make terribly guy lurch one awful judgement call another think find kind closure end describe awful ordeal do much perpetuate appal decision make lack go back flat rap sit chat man rap old friend leave decide listen voicemail tormentor leave jail woman ruin life smile nostalgically almost impossible like consider want make live comedy funny toothache well make series rare find feel antagonistic toward character endure much
1	Fillion is funny as usual, but with some needed depth for this slightly more serious drama than Castle. But I really don't get why they thought they needed to pair him with an actress nearly 20 years younger than him. The plot with the captain outright telling him he wants to see him fail because of his age is very contrived. But there are redeeming aspects in the acting and interesting things they have to deal with as beat cops.	fillion funny usual need depth slightly serious drama castle really get think need pair actress nearly year young plot captain outright tell want see fail age contrive redeem aspect act interest thing deal beat cop

This show has its flaws, but it's emotion is true and it overpowers the rest. This show has a realistic grounding, while still inspiring people like myself to do our best. I have now watched the pilot four times. I have yet to not cry during it.

0	Casting choices that rely on stereotypes about China and Asians, along with an insistence on adhering to American political correctness and a focus on racial representation, often draw criticism for not authentically representing the diversity and complexity of cultures. This sentiment reflects broader discussions in the film and television industry regarding how cultures are portrayed and the importance of genuine representation. The industry is grappling with how to balance cultural authenticity with the demands of global audiences and the principles of inclusivity and diversity. Engaging with these discussions, filmmakers and producers are encouraged to consider more nuanced and respectful approaches to storytelling that honor the richness of all cultures without resorting to clichés or stereotypes.	cast choice rely stereotype china asians along insistence adhere american political correctness focus racial representation often draw criticism authentically represent diversity complexity culture sentiment reflect broad discussion film television industry regard culture portray importance genuine representation industry grapple balance cultural authenticity demand global audience principle inclusivity diversity engage discussion filmmaker producer encourage consider nuance respectful approach storytelle honor richness culture without resort clich stereotype
1	Fallout could have been great. Could have been epic, but I can't help feeling they missed the boat. I think they made two huge mistakes in this series.First - they failed to introduce the world. As a fallout superfan I get it all but others won't. They will see silliness and zaniness without explanation and it will turn people off.They should have had the entire first season take place within the vault as a primer. Through that lens we could have learned about the vaults, the war and the surface. Raiders, ghouls, bottlecaps as currency, why the music is all 50s and all the retro things about fallout despite the advanced tech (laserguns drugs and food that doesn't spoil, why a stimpack heals her stab wound, etc). We could have learned about the world in an academic antiseptic way while having some tension within the vault as the season 1 story culminating with the opening of the vault door as the finale. That would make the jarring change between seasons real for the viewer just like it is for the protagonist as we see the differences between the book learning of the vault and the real world..Barring that at least 2-3 episodes in the vault doing the same. Everything feels so rushed in this telling.Second - they needed to tone DOWN the silliness of the games and take it slightly more seriously. Yes it can be a bit campy and such but slightly more muted than the games. Seems they went the other way instead.The writing is ok, the acting is ok, and so far the series is... well.. ok. Not great, not terrible. It could have been great.	fallout could great could epic help feel miss boat think make two huge mistake series first fail introduce world fallout superfan get other see silliness zaniness without explanation turn people entire first season take place within vault primer lens could learn vault war surface raider ghouls bottlecap currency music retro thing fallout despite advance tech lasergun drug food spoil stimpack heal stab wind etc could learn world academic antiseptic way tension within vault season story culminate open vault door finale would make jar change season real viewer like protagonist see difference book learn vault real world bar least episode vault everything feel rush tell second need tone silliness game take slightly seriously yes bite campy slightly mute game seem go way instead write ok act ok far series well ok great terrible could great
2	A mesmerising series, hypnotic performance by Andrew Scott. Difficult to stop watching and before you know it you've watched several episodes and want to watch more. Being shot in black and white somehow adds to the intrigue. A long series (8) episodes but all good.Filmed in some beautiful places, perhaps the only time when you wished it was in colour, the locations are stunning, the buildings superb. Ridley's situation becomes increasingly complicated and he is constantly running away, digging himself even further into a series of lies and apparently believing more and more in the deceptions he has created.	mesmerise series hypnotic performance andrew scott difficult stop watch know watch several episode want watch shoot black white somehow add intrigue long series episode good film beautiful place perhaps time wish colour location stun build superb ridley situation become increasingly complicate constantly run away dig even series lie apparently believe deception create

2	I love this show the first 4 seasons with the original cast were amazing I couldn't stop watching. When Isiah Washington and the other actor who played George left it slowed down a bit. Then it picked up around the 6-7 season. A song beneath a song was a beautiful episode, many hated it. I was a part of the fans who LOVED it! I cried, laughed and truly enjoyed watching the actors go past the element of just acting and showcase their musical talent. No they're NOT professional singers they're professional actors! So of course they're not going to give Adele a run for her money yet it was so nice to watch them, I enjoyed that episode so so much! Although I would've loved to have heard Sandra Oh sing as she did in a prior episode when she sung Virgin by Madonna and she actually has a nice voice. Other than that I cant wait to finish watching and catching up to the current season 13! Love love this show !!!!	love show first season original cast amaze stop watch isiah washington actor play george leave slow bite pick around season song beneath song beautiful episode many hat part fan love cry laugh truly enjoy watch actor go past element act showcase musical talent professional singer professional actor course go give adele run money yet nice watch enjoy episode much although would love hear sandra oh sing prior episode sing virgin madonna actually nice voice can not wait finish watch catch current season love love show
1	What a blistering mistake putting that face of Gonzalez in this story. D&D had so many solid female leads to choose from in their GoT roster, they went with someone who has the acting range of Kristen Stewart because... what? They needed a pouty mouth? Is she schtupping a producer to get this role? They need to off this character ASAP to salvage this series. It's the only, and sadly major, distractor of the series. Otherwise their adaptation of the book is brilliant, although a deviation from the books they are more faithful to the Cultural Revolution drivers of the plot. Kudos for that. Special effects are solid.... it is interesting comparing this to the more faithful Tencent version from China... D&D appropriately cut out a LOT of chaff from the book.	blister mistake put face gonzalez story many solid female lead choose get roster go someone act range kristen stewart need pouty mouth schtuppe producer get role need character asap salvage series sadly major distractor series otherwise adaptation book brilliant although deviation book faithful cultural revolution driver plot kudo special effect solid interest compare faithful tencent version china appropriately cut lot chaff book

There was 15 minutes left and I had NO IDEA how it would end, none, zero.For me, it was so convoluted, I just lost interest but had to keep watching to see how it was going to end.Its beyond me how this series gets 8, 9 and 10 star reviews.40 years ago a Chinese woman agrees to aid the aliens, in the present, she IS aiding the aliens but they will not be here for 400 years BUT, one of the aliens in the form of an attractive woman is communicating with the humans via televisons, anywhere, anytime.The end of the series was NOT worth the wait, trust me.I obviously did not get it, like so many reviewers did.	keep wait wait wait patient say worth say could well one bad series ever grace television minute leave idea would end none zero convolute lose interest keep watch see go end beyond series get star review year ago chinese woman agree aid alien present aid alien year one alien form attractive woman communicate human via televison anywhere anytime end series worth wait trust obviously get like many reviewer
2	This is insane. The story, the woman, every bit of it, just insane. Oh my god. There were so many moments that just made my blood boil.Somehow, This story is shockingly real, the show is written and produced by the guy this happened to. Even more shockingly, The actor who plays Donny, Richard Gadd, is the guy this stalking situation happened to! I cannot believe one could have the energy to write, produce, and act in a show based on one's own traumatic experience.Now, I get that Martha is sick, and the series made it clear that she needs help. However, I won't empathize with Martha. Don't confuse empathy with sympathy. Sure, Police/Institutions should learn many things from this Martha situation, and society should provide more resources to those with mental illness. Still, no, I don't empathize. Build many affordable therapy centers, then send her to them, permanently.	insane story woman every bite insane oh god many moment make blood boil somehow story shockingly real show write produce guy happen even shockingly actor play donny richard gadd guy stalk situation happen believe one could energy write produce act show base one traumatic experience get martha sick series make clear need help however empathize martha confuse empathy sympathy sure police institution learn many thing martha situation society provide resource mental illness still empathize build many affordable therapy center send permanently

2	"It is obvious that 3 Body Problem , which skillfully intertwines science and philosophy, will cause a difference of opinion. When I look at the comments, there are those who like it and those who criticize it. Even though I was hesitant at first, I liked it very much. The first few chapters move quite slowly. I think it was specifically designed this way to set the stage for the complex plot. If you are patient and continue with the series, it becomes increasingly interesting. There are technologically satisfying scenes and other heart touching ones. The characters are well portrayed.It is a production that I wish I had read the book first. There is also a 30-episode Chinese adaptation of the book called ""San - Ti"" that the audience liked it more but I plan to stick to the new version for now.

2	"As a veteran of Fallout 1 and 2, I was very pleasantly surprised by this adaptation. Upon first viewing, my initial impression was ""a very solid six"", but, at the time of writing this review, that has grown to an eight. An intelligently set and presented main story, which is also elegantly and wittily served sharp criticism of run amok capitalism and profit-motivated existence. Typical Fallout toilet humor, perfect background music, striking post-apocalyptic locations, great cast ... although not completely without flaws (occasional banality and cheapness), this is certainly one of the best screen adaptations of a video game."	veteran fallout pleasantly surprise adaptation upon first view initial impression solid six time write review grow eight intelligently set present main story also elegantly wittily serve sharp criticism run amok capitalism profit motivate existence typical fallout toilet humor perfect background music strike post apocalyptic location great cast although completely without flaw occasional banality cheapness certainly one good screen adaptation video game
1	The gore scenes were tried to be childish, but they are not funny at all. In a certain scene, our character's finger is cut off, but the character does not react at all. Neither funny nor gore. There is a contrived and meaningless humour in series. Fallout doesn't need to be funny or childish. It is also quite pointless to completely delete the story in Fallout New Vegas. How did you find cold fusion? How do the characters live 250 years? While it could have told very nice topics, it turned into a meaningless story and it's a shame. Also, how come 3 characters constantly run into each other in this huge state? Are you too lazy to write logically?	gore scene try childish funny certain scene character finger cut character react neither funny gore contrive meaningless humour series fallout need funny childish also quite pointless completely delete story fallout new vegas find cold fusion character live year could tell nice topic turn meaningless story shame also come character constantly run huge state lazy write logically

They were already slaughtering scientists before getting mad at Evans because of a stupid metaphor. By the way, they are using metaphors in their stupid game !Also, these aliens talk way too much. It's like in a video game, when you play badly on purpose, because you're bored and you want to lose.They're overpowered but they do nothing. They could wipe us out in a minute, but for some reason, they don't.There are so many stupid scenes in this show. For example, the infamous ship scene. They want us to believe there was no other way to do it. So stupid... Do you remember this James Bond movie that was mocked because Denise Richards played a nuclear scientist ? This is the same here. Of course our supermodel Eiza Gonzalez is a head researcher in nanotechnology. Of course she is.Also, it feels like the whole fate of the human civilization revolves around a group of young partygoers. They want us to believe these people are the top scientists on Earth, but they keep behaving like stupid teenagers. No one cares about their love stories.Seriously, don't bother...	expect dumb dumber murderer get show seem smart first think find profoundly stupid alien make sense already slaughter scientist get mad evans stupid metaphor way use metaphor stupid game also alien talk way much like video game play badly purpose bore want lose overpower nothing could wipe we minute reason many stupid scene show example infamous ship scene want we believe way stupid remember jam bond movie mock denise richard play nuclear scientist course supermodel eiza gonzalez head researcher nanotechnology course also feel like whole fate human civilization revolve around group young partygoer want we believe people top scientist earth keep behave like stupid teenager one care love story seriously bother

1	Seasons 1 to 4 were masterpieces. No doubt they let Game of Thrones be deserving of its title as possibly the greatest tv series of all time. However, this was because the plot and story was not really written by the show's writers. These seasons largely followed George RR Martin's masterpieces (the books). The intrigue, the unpredictability, the deep-woven politics and calculated moves made by characters, the depth of the story, and atmosphere created was immense, and all helped create what it was; amazing.The quality of the series took a dip once the showrunners over-took the book. Many questionable events occured from season 5 onwards, however overall, the show was still relatively decent until season 7 started. I have intentionally left out any spoilers, hence im not going to list any of the numerous plotholes and stupid things which occured in any season after season 4.The Dorne plot was atrocious, and the complete out-of-character behaviour of many protagonists (especially Stannis) really made no sense.Season 7 was clearly rushed, and the writing of D&D had clearly reached its lowest. Or so we thought.Season 8 was by far the greatest disappointment in the history of television. Character arcs were completely disregarded, the main plot (the 'Winter is Coming' theme that had been drilled into our heads for 7 seasons) was pointless, main characters stories suddenly became irrelevant, all the history and lore of the GoT universe was thrown out the window and forgotten, terrible battle plans and tactics, the main characters protected by ridiculous plot armour, terrible disney-level dialogue, no depth to the story and the most ridiculous ending all add up to make this the biggest fall from grace in the history of TV & film.Dan and Dave (writers) could not be bothered to write a half-decent story to tie up George RR Martin's life work being converted to tv, and for that they should never be allowed on another set again. GRRM put his life into the books, and for the tv adaptation to be thrown down the drain is disgusting and a crime. Hang your heads in shame, D&D.Seasons 1-4: 10/10 Seasons 5-7: 5/10 Season 8: 1/10	season masterpiece doubt let game throne deserve title possibly great tv series time however plot story really write show writer season largely follow george rr martin masterpieces book intrigue unpredictability deep weave politic calculate move make character depth story atmosphere create immense help create amaze quality series take dip showrunner take book many questionable event occur season onwards however overall show still relatively decent season start intentionally leave spoiler hence I m go list numerous plothole stupid thing occur season season dorne plot atrocious complete character behaviour many protagonist especially stannis really make sense season clearly rush write clearly reach low think season far great disappointment history television character arc completely disregard main plot winter come theme drill head season pointless main character story suddenly become irrelevant history lore get universe throw window forget terrible battle plan tactic main character protect ridiculous plot armour terrible disney level dialogue depth story ridiculous end add make big fall grace history tv film dan dave writer could bother write half decent story tie george rr martin life work convert tv never allow another set grrm put life book tv adaptation throw drain disgust crime hang head shame season season season

1	I did not know what to expect when I started watching Baby Reindeer, I definitely was not disappointed though. As each episode transpires you are riveted by the fact that this is based on a true story, which makes even more shocking. The acting is fantastic, Jessica Gunning as Martha was fascinating, one minute you despised her, the next you pitied her. Her ability to shift her emotions was amazing. It really is a screwed-up story of a warped co-dependency and being completely lost and messed up emotionally from trauma. It also explores the continual self-flagellation Richard Gadd as Donny puts himself through in the quest for fame. I was probably a little let down by the final episode, but well worth the watch.	know expect start watch baby reindeer definitely disappoint though episode transpire rivet fact base true story make even shock act fantastic jessica gun martha fascinate one minute despise next pity ability shift emotion amaze really screw story warp co dependency completely lose mess emotionally trauma also explore continual self flagellation richard gadd donny put quest fame probably little let final episode well worth watch

2	I just recently rewatched the series because my husband had never seen Game of Thrones. I wanted to watch HOTD and he was feeling left out, so I decided we should get him into GOT so he would understand more when watching HOTD. So we binged seasons 1-8. And all this did for me was remind me how angry I am with what they did. Just why? There's nothing I can say that every other review hasn't said, I just needed somewhere to put these words. Knowing how everything ends and ends so abruptly with no storytelling - which becomes even more painfully obvious when you binge everything in a 3 week timeframe, just makes all the earlier seasons almost not even worth rewatching. Such a disappointment. I'm still upset. It's been years. I know I need to move on lol. Luckily, HOTD has been pretty good, I like where the story is going but the time jumps kind of get to me. Hopefully that doesn't continue now that we've reached the beginning of the dance of the dragons.	recently rewatche series husband never see game throne want watch hotd feel leave decide get get would understand watch hotd binge season remind angry nothing say every review say need somewhere put word know everything end end abruptly storytelle become even painfully obvious binge everything week timeframe make early season almost even worth rewatche disappointment still upset year know need move lol luckily hotd pretty good like story go time jump kind get hopefully continue reach begin dance dragon

They're stuck in Osaka at the beginning and in a small fishing village from the middle. Most of the conversation is ""Just don't do it"". It feels like being controlled by every action in a Japanese master's restaurant.It's not good to use an entire season for a build-up.

A lot of scenes seem to be filmed in actual locations which is a big plus as well. Overall the story is engaging and the acting is great.Unfortunately there are many scenes that happen clearly because the writers need them to happen at that point with the only guiding force being happenstance.Smn listens in at exactly the right time to hear exactly what the audience needs to hear, smthn is discovered only because it needs to be discouvered no matter how likely it is; every main character is basically on the same path because it needs to be that way, it felt quite forced and almost rushed at times which unfortunately reduces the quality of the show overall for me.That said, the fact that I still gave it an 8 should tell you that all the rest is very well done and well worth a watch. I hope future seasons can do away with so many ""random teammeetings"" and ""perfect timings"" to ground it a little more in a 10/10 for me."	fallout fun series definitely get well later episode episode overall design scenery immaculate seriously astoundingly well make lot scene seem film actual location big plus well overall story engage act great unfortunately many scene happen clearly writer need happen point guide force happenstance smn listen exactly right time hear exactly audience need hear smthn discover need discouvere matter likely every main character basically path need way feel quite force almost rush time unfortunately reduce quality show overall say fact still give tell rest well do well worth watch hope future season away many random teammeeting perfect time grind little
0	Seasons 1 and 2 are worth the watch, but season 3 has really dropped the ball here.It's clear the show-runners have decided Season 3 will focus on educating viewers of political talking points, which would be fine if it was subtle about it and if it didn't detract from the show we know from seasons 1 and 2.Unfortunately it fails both of those tests.Episode 3 update: Same deal.

Once the messaging actually connects with your face, you do what any sane person does and leave the situation.The magic is gone.	skip several episode season three hop magic season one two manif sadly season three severely disappoint okay make believe cop show theme subtext long story keep viewer immerse make believe stray far reality viewer like start imagine camera table writer exec parse line dialogue ensure boycott show message look like go slap face hold hand defensively message actually connect face sane person leave situation magic go
0	I can be short about this. The first episodes are promising science fiction about an alien civilisation which makes contact with Earth and are heading towards our planet. But than after a few episodes which make you curious about what's going to happen and make you want te see more it just becomes a lot of scenes of endless and endless conversations between the group of friends.SPOILER ALERT: you will not see any alien nor alien civilisation in the the last episodes.Sometimes it just looks like the writers of this serie just didn't know how to follow up the first episodes and just end up in a lot of talking and talking and talking.	short first episode promise science fiction alien civilisation make contact earth head towards planet episode make curious go happen make want te see become lot scene endless endless conversation group friend spoiler alert see alien alien civilisation last episode sometimes look like writer serie know follow first episode end lot talk talk talk
2	"This is an amazing show and it is the first that I have actually watched continually. The difference in the characters' attitudes and the comedy and the drama make it a great show. The plot of this series is never really obvious, making it addicting to watch every Thursday night. I think that the thing that has gotten so many people hooked on it is that it's not just about the patients in the hospital and their problems, but about the people that work at the hospital and their relationships and their personal lives. Without that feel to the show, it would just be like ""Scrubs"" or ""ER"". I have been very impressed with Season 3 and hope the show continues for a long while."	amaze show first actually watch continually difference character attitude comedy drama make great show plot series never really obvious make addict watch every thursday night think thing get many people hook patient hospital problem people work hospital relationship personal live without feel show would like scrub er impress season hope show continue long

1	"Most of the characters in this series are insufferable. They are arrogant, spoiled, obnoxious brats. Both the old and the young. Their dialogue swings between sappy and on the nose by the sentence. But, there's good news. I found that I could fast forward through most of the interpersonal 'filler' and suffer no loss of story progress.This is one of those shows that thinks it's smarter than it is. A good example is the shows idea of 'innovation.' The propulsion system proposed in the show is seen by other researchers as 'ground-breaking.' But, in truth, this technique has been used in a number of sci-fi properties for years, and even presented visually on screen.At one point one of the characters mentioned that they're going to go watch Rick and Morty. And the Rick and Morty reference made me laugh at the program, since this show seems well aligned for that crowd. It's not 'actually' smart, but plays like it is. That is this series in a nutshell.It's probably enough material for a movie, but stretched to 8 hours, it quickly becomes laborious to watch.I'd describe the series as ""ok."" I don't understand the hype behind it. Actual science is very difficult to understand at times. But, at no time was this hard to follow in the least. Dumbed down? Yes. Just dumb?

1	The pacing of the first episode is too fast.With four or five storylines running concurrently, it's a mess. If Tencent's Three-Body version is criticized for slow pacing, then Netflix's version is like rushing to catch a train, leaving no breathing space, and characters are merely pushed along by the plot. The constant switching between multiple storylines and the introduction of so many characters in the first episode would be confusing for anyone who hasn't done their homework. Even with the scientific explanations cut, I doubt Western audiences could understand what the first episode is trying to say.If the last two episodes were cut and the content of the first two episodes were expanded, the viewing experience would definitely improve significantly. Alternatively, adding two more episodes for a total of 12 might suffice, but with only eight episodes covering everything from Ye Zhetai to the Wallfacer Project, how could it not feel rushed?	pace first episode fast four five storyline run concurrently mess tencent three body version criticize slow pace netflix version like rush catch train leave breathe space character merely push along plot constant switch multiple storyline introduction many character first episode would confuse anyone do homework even scientific explanation cut doubt western audience could understand first episode try say last two episode cut content first two episode expand view experience would definitely improve significantly alternatively add two episode total might suffice eight episode cover everything ye zhetai wallfacer project could feel rush

That's right i was not even bothered to see the final episode, and the reason is that i read it didn't end and that there is likely to be a second season in 2026. Absolutely not bothered because i know i'll just be bitterly disappointed. Inventing Anna did this to me, i was so invested and at the end was like what am absolute waste of time that was.At the end of episode 7 which had a whole lot of personal interplay and little main story development i was left wondering how they would wrap it up in the finale, but alas they don't.

2	"This show offers a realistic view of how rookie police officers deal with their daily routine. As a child raised in a family of law enforcement professionals, this show is the closest representation of how the characters deal with work, colleagues and relationships. The characters in the show seem real and have issues of their own.Nathan Fillion as the lead is tremendous in his role of Rookie Officer Nolan. He brings his innate charm to the role of a downtrodden man that seeks to find meaning in his life by joining the police force. There is heart in his performances and that becomes the conduit through which the audience can empathize and sympathize with him and the more jaded police officers of the show. His signature brazen attitude is toned down compared to his role in Castle or his Captain Mal from Firefly. In the more somber moments of the show you can see that Officer Nolan has pain in his heart and has been through rough times, but he champions through it. That's where Fillion does his best work.The rest of the cast also does a great job, but there are the unavoidable stereotypes. The three main actors orbiting Fillion are Richard T. Jones as Sergeant Grey, the sergeant that doesn't like Nolan because he's too old to be a cop, trying to crush his morale in hopes that he will either quit or be a better officer for it. His performance is solid and the chemistry between him and Fillion is palpable. The little side-eyes and moments of silence are awkward but fun to watch as you root for Nolan but also understand Sergeant Grey's viewpoint.His trainer, officer Bishop played by Afton Williamson, is a tough officer that's overly ambitious and sees Nolan as an opportunity to get to the detective seat faster. She is his anchor in the show, pulling Nolan down to reality. There are glances in the show that are done very expertly and subtly by Williamson, where you as the audience realize that she actually begins to admire and respect Nolan. That humanizes her character and makes her likable.Melissa O'Neil portrays rookie Lucy Chen, who is romantically involved with Nolan. She is initially presented as a badass rookie that has a take charge attitude. O'Neil is very believable as that character and her chemistry with Fillion is great. However, her chemistry with Eric Winter's character as her trainer, Officer Bradford, is what helps the character stand on her own and not just as the romantic interest. She is constantly challenged and belittled by Bradford who is jaded but sincere in his desire to make her the best officer she can be. I liken his character to that of John C. McGinley's Dr. Cox from Scrubs.So far this shows sets itself apart from the current ""cop dramas"" on tv. Shows like Magnum PI, Lethal Weapon and NCIS tend to sensationalize how crime fighting is done. The Rookie doesn't shy away from law enforcement lingo and spouting regulations, but it is not done to glamorize how roguish or cool the lead characters are. In fact, Officer Nolan and his fellow rookies learn from each episode what it means to be a better officer."	show offer realistic view rookie police officer deal daily routine child raise family law enforcement professional show close representation character deal work colleague relationship character show seem real issue nathan fillion lead tremendous role rookie officer nolan bring innate charm role downtrodden man seek find mean life join police force heart performance become conduit audience empathize sympathize jade police officer show signature brazen attitude tone compare role castle captain mal firefly somber moment show see officer nolan pain heart rough time champion fillion good work rest cast also great job unavoidable stereotype three main actor orbit fillion richard jones sergeant grey sergeant like nolan old cop try crush morale hop either quit well officer performance solid chemistry fillion palpable little side eye moment silence awkward fun watch root nolan also understand sergeant grey viewpoint trainer officer bishop play afton williamson tough officer overly ambitious see nolan opportunity get detective seat fast anchor show pull nolan reality glance show do expertly subtly williamson audience realize actually begin admire respect nolan humanize character make likable melissa neil portray rookie lucy chen romantically involve nolan initially present badass rookie take charge attitude neil believable character chemistry fillion great however chemistry eric winter character trainer officer bradford help character stand romantic interest constantly challenge belittle bradford jade sincere desire make good officer liken character john c mcginley dr cox scrub far show set apart current cop dramas tv show like magnum pi lethal weapon ncis tend sensationalize crime fight do rookie shy away law enforcement lingo spout regulation do glamorize roguish cool lead character fact officer nolan fellow rookie learn episode mean well officer
2	Richard Gadd who plays the lead character of Donny is extremely charismatic and natural that it's impossible for any viewer to not follow his story, regardless of the theme!I'm not sure about the ratio of dramatic effects vs. Real life depictions in this show, however it's pretty devastating to see all the horrible events that he has experienced and at the same time quite encouraging to see his success at the end of his ordeal.Having said the above, something that this story is missing is delving a little deeper or at least providing critique for cultural nuances of why he had such a conservative attitude to sexuality that made him vulnerable? Why he was goading the stalker at times? Or even, why the stalker needed to stalk?Looking at the social behaviours in UK from a Scandinavian perspective, it seems that British social norms are more based on saving face(fakery) than brutal honesty!For example, it can be said that Donny was providing space for the stalker to continue stalking only on the basis that he wanted to be seen as polite!?That is a mind boggling approach to go along with different rather life altering situations and experiences since you can't just say No! Donny's excuse with various characters who harmed him could be that he just wanted to be polite/people pleaser!?As I see Scandinavian people tend to be direct even though seen as harsh, cold, etc., it seems that the main character's problems were more rooted in his social values(people pleasing,etc) than just another person's actions.	richard gadd play lead character donny extremely charismatic natural impossible viewer follow story regardless theme sure ratio dramatic effect vs real life depiction show however pretty devastate see horrible event experience time quite encourage see success end ordeal say something story miss delve little deep least provide critique cultural nuance conservative attitude sexuality make vulnerable goad stalker time even stalker need stalk look social behaviour uk scandinavian perspective seem british social norm base save face fakery brutal honesty example say donny provide space stalker continue stalk basis want see polite mind boggle approach go along different rather life alter situation experience since say donny excuse various character harm could want polite people pleaser see scandinavian people tend direct even though see harsh cold etc seem main character problem root social value people please etc another person action
2	Completely unfamiliar with the video game, have followed Wade's career however, and as usual he delivers carrying the heart and soul of the series.No spoilers here.Good old fashioned classic tale, sorta Good vs. Evil, but who actually are the good guys or the bad guys?The authors do a great job engaging their politics within the scenery set designs and experiences of the individual characters as opposed to preaching and ramming silliness down the viewers throats.They present a most unforgiving world, which removes a lot of modern silly wokeness and pronouns when survival is the base necessity... They show that stuff gets tossed to the wayside... in season 1 anyhow.. This Allows the viewer to make up their own inferences and ideas as the story kinda S L O W L Y unfolds.Yes, I get it... ya'll be watchin' and flippin' through your phones... but the story eventually begins to move along and percolate nicely, into a good old mystery...Gorgeous set designs and use of classic music in the first few episodes to beautifully exemplify the disparity of their past vs. The future we and they are presented with... The entire production is beautifully stylized, the film, the costumes, the plot oh MY!Every detail in their world is superbly presented which makes the world presented believable!Every actor do their characters justice.. all skilled, from bit players to scene stealers, they give their characters depth and we can feel their desperation in such an unforgiving world.Ate season one UP like popcorn!!Looking forward to an engrossing story line, so sit back, open your mind and get carried away into a fun filled action packed distopia!Rod Sterling would be proud!	completely unfamiliar video game follow wade career however usual deliver carry heart soul series spoiler good old fashion classic tale sorta good vs evil actually good guy bad guy author great job engage politic within scenery set design experience individual character oppose preach ram silliness viewer throat present unforgive world remove lot modern silly wokeness pronoun survival base necessity show stuff get toss wayside season anyhow allow viewer make inference idea story kinda l w l unfold yes get ya watchin flippin phone story eventually begin move along percolate nicely good old mystery gorgeous set design use classic music first episode beautifully exemplify disparity past vs future present entire production beautifully stylize film costume plot oh every detail world superbly present make world present believable every actor character justice skilled bite player scene stealer give character depth feel desperation unforgive world eat season one like popcorn look forward engross story line sit back open mind get carry away fun fill action pack distopia rod sterling would proud

Hey producers: why you are stuck with clichés? Are you afraid of the universality of the book? Why you don't keep the core of this cleverly written book? Why you use this book to make unnecessary propagandas (I'm from mass media, sorry)? Again, why you are not loyal to the book which is way more ahead than your prejudices? Why you don't see the whole world? As a hard-core sci fi lover from Europe I'm very upset. You have budget to do everything yet you keep on using these stories to condition minds... Narrow minds.

I binged this show multiple times and this season (14) is just the worst. I don't care about the characters anymore. The new ones are boring. And good grief people need to keep politics OUT of shows. It's progressively getting worse and what was once my favorite now makes me angry. So, I recommend the earlier seasons for sure, but stop before here.

2	Initially, I thought this might be a sequel or prequel to Castle, a show I enjoyed in the past. However, this series surpassed my expectations and even the success of Castle, I believe.It's perfect for viewers of all ages who enjoy a blend of action, drama, and comedy. While there are some episodes with less storytelling depth, the subsequent ones usually make viewers forget about any shortcomings.The show boasts well-developed and diverse characters, along with great humor. However, I'm still waiting for a more intricate conclusion to the overarching story.Looking forward to the upcoming seasons (currently in its fourth), hoping they maintain the same level of enjoyment, making it suitable even for family viewing.	initially think might sequel prequel castle show enjoy past however series surpass expectation even success castle believe perfect viewer age enjoy blend action drama comedy episode less storytelle depth subsequent one usually make viewer forget shortcoming show boast well develop diverse character along great humor however still wait intricate conclusion overarch story look forward upcoming season currently fourth hop maintain level enjoyment make suitable even family view
0	With this billed as Netflix no.1 and all the positive reviews, to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. Truth be told, I was bored in parts and found it dragged in places. Sadly, I didn't need the large quantities of tissues I was advised to buy. Yes, it was a sobering tale but I kept wondering why Donny let it go on. There were shades of Stockholm syndrome and mutual dependence. The acting was outstanding, Jessica Gunning being a tour de force, but it just didn't do it for me. As this is based on a true story, how difficult it must have been for the writer to bare his soul like this.	bill netflix positive review say disappoint would understatement truth tell bore part find drag place sadly need large quantity tissue advise buy yes sober tale keep wonder donny let go shade stockholm syndrome mutual dependence act outstanding jessica gun tour de force base true story difficult must writer bare soul like
2	I've watched the first three seasons of Grey's anatomy within four weeks and it took me by surprise. The first season started up alright and interesting, but it was clear that the characters had not been developed yet.They were somewhat rigid and not always easy to get used to. This flaw was well compensated in the second season, when, in my opinion, the show really hitted off. From that point on, it became the strong soapy drama which it has been till now. The characters were presented in a broader sense, the story lines took me on stronger than before and the great acting lifted the whole series up a notch.Or even two. In my opinion, season two was the best out of the three and especially the cliffhanger of the second season was excellent. Season three was somewhat different, in the way that the traditional story lines settled down a bit more then before. This resulted in a sometimes completely different perspective then I was used to with this series and in all honesty, was not always satisfactory. However, this show has not been dull one moment and the damage is done; you're so much in love with the characters that you simply want more then you already have. If you liked the interrelationships between the characters of -for example- ER, you'll like this.The medical cases are nice, but not the most interesting within the range of medical series.The drama is what should take you on and if it does, you'll see a series with excellent acting, nice story lines and an addictive setting. If you add that up with the superb mix of soap themes and strong, well acted drama you'll know that this show holds a promising future and is well worth the investment of your time.	watch first three season grey anatomy within four week take surprise first season start alright interest clear character develop yet somewhat rigid always easy get use flaw well compensate second season opinion show really hitte point become strong soapy drama till character present broad sense story line take strong great act lift whole series notch even two opinion season two good three especially cliffhang second season excellent season three somewhat different way traditional story line settle bite result sometimes completely different perspective use series honesty always satisfactory however show dull one moment damage do much love character simply want already like interrelationship character example er like medical case nice interest within range medical series drama take see series excellent act nice story line addictive set add superb mix soap theme strong well act drama know show hold promise future well worth investment time
0	Except the effects, this series is pure garbage. Storytelling, action, characters, everything is faulty and amateurish.I really have never seen something so badly made, it's a sort of slapstick farce enhanced by technology.Nothing links with anything, there is a obscure, barely discernable plot going on, the characters have no real motivations, the action flow is fractured and twisted without reason, in fact one could analyze this piece of crap on how not to assemble a drama of any kind.Now it has a 8.6 IMDB rating. This is atrocious.Felt the need to log in here to write this even though I don't do reviews here.Watch it on your own cost, if you assign zero value to your personal time.	except effect series pure garbage storytelle action character everything faulty amateurish really never see something badly make sort slapstick farce enhance technology nothing link anything obscure barely discernable plot go character real motivation action flow fracture twist without reason fact one could analyze piece crap assemble drama kind imdb rat atrocious feel need log write even though review watch cost assign zero value personal time
2	I have enjoyed this series from the very start. It is nice to have only a few main key characters to follow - allowing them the chance to have more in-depth story lines outside their hospital duties. Whilst some of the couplings were easy to see coming others weren't. Nice twist with Addisons former lover reappearing to re-win her affections only for him to make a pass at Meredith. The most unexpected for me is that of George & Callie. The last few episodes here in the UK have had me screaming at the TV that they cant end there.... The episode ending with Preston shot down outside the hospital and the following one - pure genius. Izzys love triangle with the almost dying Danny and the sometimes annoying Alex only add to the romantic intrigue. These mixed with the weekly medical cases of varying severity make the show a mix of drama romance and light black comedy. Loved the episode with the unexploded bomb in the patients chest cavity - it was great television. I only wish it was on terrestrial TV here in UK - I rave about it to work colleagues and they don't have Cable so are really missing out. Keep it up for many seasons to come....	enjoy series start nice main key character follow allow chance depth story line outside hospital duty whilst couple easy see come other nice twist addison former lover reappear win affection make pass meredith unexpected george callie last episode uk scream tv can not end episode end preston shoot outside hospital follow one pure genius izzys love triangle almost die danny sometimes annoy alex add romantic intrigue mix weekly medical case vary severity make show mix drama romance light black comedy love episode unexplode bomb patient chest cavity great television wish terrestrial tv uk rave work colleague cable really miss keep many season come

I should have remembered how much of a flop season 8 of GOT was, the season that wasn't written by the original author. 3 body problem just highlights how much of a genius George R R Martin really was/is and not much of GITs success was down to Benioff and Weiss. Just so underwhelming.I expected much more from 3 body problem, but instead we just got static scenes, with GOT actors playing stiff characters.

1	Take an 11/10 series and give it one bad episode that completely disregards every narrative and character arc established and built upon over the last 8 years and you go from being on top of the world to being disposable trash. I can't in good faith give this show a 1/10, even though that would be accurate to how it ended, but MOST of this show is fantastic. They just completely threw it away at the last possible moment, for apparently no good reason other than shock and subversion.	take series give one bad episode completely disregard every narrative character arc establish build upon last year go top world disposable trash good faith give show even though would accurate end show fantastic completely throw away last possible moment apparently good reason shock subversion

1	Tom Ripley is meant to be young and ambitious. He leaves his dark and dreary life to drink in the colourful world of the wealthy. But in this sorrowful reimagining, he is a middle-aged man who looks like a serial killer and shows an utter lack of normal human emotion. He leaves a crummy life in NYC to go to an equally colourless version of Italy (which is usually a rich tapestry of colour). No one would be taken in by this version of Tom who reads as immediately creepy. And unlike the Hollywood movie with Matt Damon and Jude Law, there is no chemistry between the two male leads. So, the motive of Tom feeling misled by Dickie about the nature of their relationship is nonexistent. It just comes off as guy randomly offing another guy who barely tolerates him: a dispassionate crime. And dispassionate is how I would describe the whole show. But somehow for others, the bland acting and backdrops seem to pop. Maybe they think people like me are missing the point. That's all right because I'd counter the emperor has no clothes!	tom ripley mean young ambitious leave dark dreary life drink colourful world wealthy sorrowful reimagine middle age man look like serial killer show utter lack normal human emotion leave crummy life nyc go equally colourless version italy usually rich tapestry colour one would take version tom read immediately creepy unlike hollywood movie matt damon jude law chemistry two male lead motive tom feel mislead dickie nature relationship nonexistent come guy randomly off another guy barely tolerate dispassionate crime dispassionate would describe whole show somehow other bland act backdrop seem pop maybe think people like miss point right counter emperor clothe
1	A very interesting sci-fi series, adaptation of Liu Cixin's novel (I was shocked to found that Wandering Earth is also based on his work).In brief, this is about the human's race to save their future from an alien species which wants to make earth as their new home.I liked the mystery of first 5 episodes, the way it was build. And then the actual drama begins, which focuses more on character's life and their conversation on loosing friends, messed up relationships 😟. It's all build up for final episode and it pays off!Everything aside, it was the WOW-signal which clicked me 😂, direct reference of real life incident. You know if you know, old Nat-Geo Discovery nerds 😉.Though the series is great but I would prefer to read the book, because the scale of the story was feeling larger but from the series pov it was not that big.	interest sci fi series adaptation liu cixin novel shock find wander earth also base work brief human race save future alien specie want make earth new home like mystery first episode way build actual drama begin focus character life conversation loose friend mess relationship build final episode pay everything aside wow signal click direct reference real life incident know know old nat geo discovery nerd though series great would prefer read book scale story feel large series pov big
0	If you enjoy the series, do NOT read the books. It will forever taint the fondness you have for the adaptation.If you read the books, be prepared to be disappointed. They've made so much detrimental and unnecessary changes to the source materials often at the spirit and core of the books.They've truncated a lot of the main characters by merging several characters into one. Naturally, we have the usual hollywood race and gender swap. Some of the roles and plots doesn't appear until the later books all got mashed together in one season and one character.The worst transgression is: The trilogy was always about the bigger picture and have equal focus on the science and the characters. This adaptation put way too much emphasis on the characters as if it was GOT or the walking dead when it's a completely different theme and scope.There are already enough complexity in the plot with the science, but they thought it was a good idea to unnecessary add teenage high school like drama to the adaptation.Take for example, Salazar. One of the worst written character in recent history. Always emotional, to the point of threatening physical violence to one of her friend's jabs. And she was supposed to be a brilliant scientist, just watch her and ask yourself when is the last time you see ANY female scientist irl talk like her and as emotionally unstable as her?After watching this series I'm convinced D&D is incapable of writing anything good by themselves and only get carried by the works of others with genuine brilliance.	enjoy series read book forever taint fondness adaptation read book prepare disappoint make much detrimental unnecessary change source material often spirit core book truncate lot main character merge several character one naturally usual hollywood race gender swap role plot appear later book get mash together one season one character bad transgression trilogy always big picture equal focus science character adaptation put way much emphasis character get walk dead completely different theme scope already enough complexity plot science think good idea unnecessary add teenage high school like drama adaptation take example salazar one bad write character recent history always emotional point threaten physical violence one friend jab suppose brilliant scientist watch ask last time see female scientist irl talk like emotionally unstable watch series convince incapable write anything good get carry work other genuine brilliance
2	SEASON: 8.0 I recently finished binge-watching the first season of Ripley, and it's a refreshing take on a classic character. In a world of reboots and remakes, it's nice to see something done differently and done well.Based on Patricia Highsmith's novels, Ripley takes us on a twisted journey through the mind of a sociopathic conman. Andrew Scott is absolutely mesmerising in the title role. Sure, he may be playing the character at a much older age than in the source material, but he brings an oddly enticing complexity to the role that's downright captivating.Steven Zaillian's writing and direction ensure a consistent tone throughout each episode, and the decision to present the series in black and white only adds to its allure. Some may find it controversial, but personally, I think it marries well with the period setting, giving the show a timeless quality.Now, I'll admit, Ripley doesn't shy away from violence, so if you're squeamish, this may not be the show for you. And the pace? Well, let's just say it's extremely deliberate. Some may find it a bit glacial at times, but personally, I found it added to the tension and suspense.Overall, Ripley is a compelling and stylish thriller that's sure to keep you hooked from start to finish. If you're a fan of dark, character-driven dramas, do yourself a favour and give it a watch. With stellar performances, gorgeous cinematography, and a gripping storyline, it's one ride you won't want to miss.FORMAT: StreamingVIDEO: 10.0 Native 2160/24p streaming presentation Detail level: Excellent Colour reproduction: Excellent Level accuracy: Excellent Encode: Excellent Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10.0 Dolby Atmos streaming audio Dialogue reproduction: Excellent Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent Dynamics: Excellent Surround sound presentation: Excellent LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 8.0.	season recently finish binge watch first season ripley refresh take classic character world reboot remake nice see something do differently do well base patricia highsmith novels ripley take we twist journey mind sociopathic conman andrew scott absolutely mesmerise title role sure may play character much old age source material bring oddly entice complexity role downright captivate steven zaillian write direction ensure consistent tone throughout episode decision present series black white add allure may find controversial personally think marry well period set give show timeless quality admit ripley shy away violence squeamish may show pace well let say extremely deliberate may find bite glacial time personally find add tension suspense overall ripley compel stylish thriller sure keep hook start finish fan dark character drive drama favour give watch stellar performance gorgeous cinematography grip storyline one ride want miss format streamingvideo native p stream presentation detail level excellent colour reproduction excellent level accuracy excellent encode excellent master condition excellentaudio dolby atmos stream audio dialogue reproduction excellent soundtrack effect clarity excellent dynamic excellent surround sound presentation excellent lfe content excellentmoofiemeter
2	I have had people telling me for years to watch greys anatomy and I'll be honest, I have just kept thinking no thanks. Another medical show? I think I'll keep scrolling and watch something decent. Wow, was I wrong.I have only been watching a few weeks and it has taken over my life. Any spare minute I get is devoted to this show and already I am on series 8.This show has me invested in a way that is very rare. You genuinely care and root for the characters and it writes characters in a way that can make you love them after 20 mins of an episode. That's not to say that they ate not flawed though. I have gone back and forth on loving Alex and hating Alex more times than I can count.This show also has the ability to turn you inside out. Never before have I cried so much. When Denny died I texted my friend to tell her how it destroyed me. Her response? Just you wait.The character development and plot lines are exciting and engrossing and sometimes maddening but I absolutely love this show and it's characters. I am so obsessed with it that I cannot stop watching. I will have to slow down though because I think I will be quite lost when it's finished.My fave episodes so far: The train crash where the two people get impaled together.The shooting episodes in the hospital The bomb in the guys abdomen episode The one where George diesBest relationships in the series so far: Lexie and mark Torres and Arizona Miranda and Ben.Best Friendships Mark and Torres Miranda and derek shepherd Meredith and Cristina.	people tell year watch grey anatomy honest keep think thank another medical show think keep scroll watch something decent wow wrong watch week take life spare minute get devote show already series show invest way rare genuinely care root character write character way make love min episode say eat flaw though go back forth love alex hat alex time count show also ability turn inside never cry much denny die texte friend tell destroy response wait character development plot line excite engross sometimes madden absolutely love show character obsess stop watch slow though think quite lose finish fave episode far train crash two people get impale together shoot episode hospital bomb guy abdomen episode one george diesbest relationships series far lexie mark torres arizona miranda ben good friendship mark torre miranda derek shepherd meredith cristina
2	There's probably nothing that can be said today that hasn't been said about Game of Thrones that should be news. Everything that you have heard about the show - from the wonderful visual effects, to the set design, the cinematography, the beautiful score to the acting - holds true till the very end. In that regard, this show (as of the writing of this review) is the benchmark and it'll be hard to get toppled over. The talented directors and writers over this 8 year period gave us a fantasy epic which has become a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon that will forever remain a huge part of many people's lives, and for that I am grateful.The final season has just wrapped up, and unfortunately the show's legacy is now going to be two-fold. There was a time when people clamored to find out how Game of Thrones was going to conclude, a time where people were anxious because a show of this magnitude ending would leave a void in people's hearts that would be hard for any show to fill, a time where it seemed like this show was going to legitimize itself as *the* greatest show of all time. However, due to the nature of its conclusion, that is no longer the case. Game of Thrones is going to be remembered as quite possibly the greatest show with the greatest crashing of an ending.The biggest issue of the series is going to come down to poor writing, poor pacing, and lack of episodes as it approached its final seasons. Season 7 and 8 represent mixed bags of goodies. You can tell what the goal of each big moment was and as a fan and I was all down for it. I'm not going to spoil what these moments were because i'd like new comers to not get deterred away from the massive onslaught by fans right now, but the thing to take away from this is that there's a significant dip in character arcs and there are choices that are made that just don't work because there was not enough time to execute them properly. I'm sure in the minds of the writers, they made sense because they have probably had in-depth discussions with each other about where each character is going to end up, but translating that to screen with fewer episodes where everything seems so overwhelmingly rushed skips the integral moments that help let the audience come along this journey. The pace at which the last two seasons have progressed contains frankly enough content to make at least 20 episodes, rather than just hastily putting it all in 13. We've received a conclusion that falls flat because it wasn't properly built up and earned. It's an ending which, while may represent the actual book ending, does not work for the direction the show was leading into.All in all, I love Game of Thrones. It's still going to be up there regarded as one of the best series ever for good reason. It's just extremely disappointing and disheartening to witness the route it took towards the end which made it seem like the writers wanted to end the show as soon as possible (whether it be to work on other projects, or they simply did not really know how to expand it). It's going to leave the fanbase divided, but I hope over time people focus more on the good we got rather than the bad - because this show still deserves it.	probably nothing say today say game throne news everything hear show wonderful visual effect set design cinematography beautiful score act hold true till end regard show write review benchmark hard get topple talented director writer year period give we fantasy epic become worldwide pop culture phenomenon forever remain huge part many people live grateful final season wrap unfortunately show legacy go two fold time people clamor find game throne go conclude time people anxious show magnitude end would leave void people heart would hard show fill time seem like show go legitimize great show time however due nature conclusion long case game throne go remember quite possibly great show great crash end big issue series go come poor write poor pace lack episode approach final season season represent mix bag goody tell goal big moment fan go spoil moment like new comer get deter away massive onslaught fan right thing take away significant dip character arc choice make work enough time execute properly sure mind writer make sense probably depth discussion character go end translate screen few episode everything seem overwhelmingly rush skip integral moment help let audience come along journey pace last two season progress contain frankly enough content make least episode rather hastily put receive conclusion fall flat properly build earn end may represent actual book end work direction show lead love game throne still go regard one good series ever good reason extremely disappoint dishearten witness route take towards end make seem like writer want end show soon possible whether work project simply really know expand go leave fanbase divide hope time people focus good get rather bad show still deserve
2	I have been waiting for this since i watched the trailer.I am old enough to remember the original series with Richard Chamberlain in the 80's.Never read the book so cannot say if this version or the 80's one is true to it but from the first episode i am sucked in.The scenery/cgi and period costumes are great and i like that the Japanese are speaking Japanese with subtitles as i enjoy things in their original languages. Shame the Portugese speak English but its a minor thing.The lead actors are great(I especially enjoy Hiroyuki Sanada's work)and the English cursing always amuses my childish self.Anyway i am looking forwrd to the rest of the episodes.	wait since watch trailer old enough remember original series richard chamberlain never read book say version one true first episode suck scenery cgi period costume great like japanese speak japanese subtitle enjoy thing original language shame portugese speak english minor thing lead actor great especially enjoy hiroyuki sanada work english curse always amuse childish self anyway look forwrd rest episode
0	I don't know what I was thinking trusting these boys after what they did with GoT. They've done it again. Taken a reputable IP and butchered it beyond recognition. However, perhaps that was the goal, to appeal to Western audiences, but in doing so - and whilst visuallly impressive, I think they've ended up with a worse adaptation of the overall story.If you've read the books, this Netflix version is abysmal. It completely missed the existential dread and cosmic horror of the books. Nevermind changing races and locations of characters, mixing characters from different generations?! Bizarre.If you haven't read the books, it's just OK. They've stripped down so much of what made the story compelling and present it as flat as possible. Disappointing.	know think trust boy get do take reputable ip butcher beyond recognition however perhaps goal appeal western audience whilst visuallly impressive think end bad adaptation overall story read book netflix version abysmal completely miss existential dread cosmic horror book nevermind change race location character mix character different generation bizarre read book ok strip much make story compel present flat possible disappoint
0	Started really good the first two seasons but after that it gradually gets worse and worse for every season. Season 6 has started horrible. The poor acting or should I say overacting is terrible but the writing/story is even worse. Everything that happens is unbelievable stupid and not at all relatable or believable. To much drama for even the slightest bit of problem and to much problems happens to the characters both in their private lifes and in their work. The wedding episode in the beginning of season 6 forced me to stop watching because all the overacted drama happening and everything went wrong over and over again so it was just pathetic. Just painful to watch. I know it's American but this even to stupid for Americans to watch. I hope it gets better as I'm still to curious about what will happen to stop watching but I doubt it will.	start really good first two season gradually get worse bad every season season start horrible poor act say overact terrible write story even bad everything happen unbelievable stupid relatable believable much drama even slight bite problem much problem happen character private life work we d episode begin season force stop watch overact drama happen everything go wrong pathetic painful watch know american even stupid americans watch hope get well still curious happen stop watch doubt
0	I'd rate season one and two, 8 and 7, respectively. I'm a Fillion fan, and police procedurals are okay in general. But there are caveats with those procedurals. The original NCIS is one of the few series that has avoided deteriorating into a soap opera about people in uniform.Alas, The Rookie show runners chose to focus on the young attractive cast and their personal lives instead of mystery and criminal plotlines. The problem is that most of the supporting cast aren't ready for their moment in the sun. Afton Williamson, who played Nolan's Training Officer left the show early on, citing sexual harassment (by a recurring guest star). Her departure hurt the show. She and Fillion had good chemistry, and her character was well written. There was more grittiness in other roles early on as well. That rough edged texture was exchanged for melodrama and romantic shenanigans. Bradford is now a goofy beefcake stereotype, instead of a seriously conflicted T. O. And the scripts putting regular duty cops in SWAT type situations is frankly ridiculous. Characters with emotional and psychological liabilities (officer Chen are you listening?) are frequently put in key positions, only to predictably fail, or develop near superhuman abilities (officer Harper) that make them a hero.Season three is when the wheels came off. It is so bad that you would actually have to watch it yourself to believe how uncomprehendingly bad it is. It was produced during a period when BLM and police malfeasance were under a microscope. The scripts became focused on white supremacy, with even Nolan (Fillion's character) being forced into sensitivity training for unconscious racial bias. Hey, one episode, maybe even two, but an entire season?The end of season three was a convoluted mess, but featured the end of one of the least effective characters, thankfully so.At that point the plots got insanely ridiculous. One of the team becomes the psychological muse/political pawn of a female drug cartel leader? And when the team crashes a warehouse filled with gang members, the team actually shushes them, instead of shooting or restraining them. I. Am. Not. Kidding.Once we get into season five it's all soap and crazy master criminal plot lines. Silly stuff really.Then they spun off an even sillier series, The Rookie Feds. I can't even begin to describe how bad that was, except to say... it was canceled after one season.	rate season one two respectively fillion fan police procedural okay general caveat procedural original ncis one series avoid deteriorate soap opera people uniform alas rookie show runner choose focus young attractive cast personal live instead mystery criminal plotline problem support cast ready moment sun afton williamson play nolan train officer leave show early cite sexual harassment recur guest star departure hurt show fillion good chemistry character well write grittiness role early well rough edge texture exchange melodrama romantic shenanigans bradford goofy beefcake stereotype instead seriously conflict script put regular duty cop swat type situation frankly ridiculous character emotional psychological liability officer chen listen frequently put key position predictably fail develop near superhuman ability officer harper make hero season three wheel come bad would actually watch believe uncomprehendingly bad produce period blm police malfeasance microscope script become focus white supremacy even nolan fillion character force sensitivity train unconscious racial bias hey one episode maybe even two entire season end season three convolute mess feature end one least effective character thankfully point plot get insanely ridiculous one team become psychological muse political pawn female drug cartel leader team crash warehouse fill gang member team actually shush instead shoot restrain kid get season five soap crazy master criminal plot line silly stuff really spin even silly series rookie feds even begin describe bad except say cancel one season
0	I used to love this show over the years. There were high notes and boring episodes, but you always knew that Game of Thrones would deliver in the end. Everybody would get what's coming for them.Until Season 8, Episode 3. The big finale the show has been building up to for eight seasons. Winter had come.And Winter left again. In one episode. One incredibly boring episode of pointless fighting that had the artistic greatness of a low-budget Xena fight scene.And then it was over. Eight seasons of bloodletting, plotting and scheming were thrown away in a single episode.Thats what Game of Thrones is now. A hollow shell of its former glory, because now we know whats inside. Now we know whats behind every curtain.Nothing but a tiny dagger to the heart.	use love show year high note bore episode always know game throne would deliver end everybody would get come season episode big finale show build eight season winter come winter leave one episode one incredibly bore episode pointless fight artistic greatness low budget xena fight scene eight season bloodlette plot scheme throw away single episode that s game throne hollow shell former glory know what s inside know what s behind every curtain nothing tiny dagger heart

0	I'm not in favor of cutting creative freedom, but selling a period film with so many story inaccuracies (Torunaga didn't even exist...................... .......) Then, combined with a total historical inaccuracy, the contradiction. On the one hand we have Japanese speaking Japanese, English speaking English and Spanish (Portugal's allies since when?!?!?) speaking Spanish. On the other hand, we have Portuguese speaking... everything but Portuguese.Finally, like the nail in the coffin, reinventing something is doing it better, especially when it is said to be the new Game of Thrones. The lack of a Portuguese character (who is empathetic to us) that makes up the chess game that was the Japan of Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu kills me. Now I understand what the Chinese and Russians feel when they watch American films...	favor cut creative freedom sell period film many story inaccuracy torunaga even exist combine total historical inaccuracy contradiction one hand japanese speak japanese english speak english spanish portugal ally since speak spanish hand portuguese speak everything portuguese finally like nail coffin reinvent something well especially say new game throne lack portuguese character empathetic we make chess game japan nobunaga hideyoshi tokugawa ieyasu kill understand chinese russians feel watch american film

0	Trying to make an artistic impression with black and white was a huge mistake when filming on the Amalfi Coast, Naples and, to a lesser extent, Rome. The film (or I should say TV show) looks sterile and flat, as if it was shot on an iPhone then edited to a B&W filter.The acting is equally pale. Andrew Scott as Ripley is passable, but aside from the Italian character actors (who are fine) the other performances are self-consciously flat. Worst is the part of Freddie Miles - a fantastic character-acting opportunity as evidenced by Philip Seymour Hoffman in The Talented Mr Ripley and even, to a lesser extent, by Billy Kearns in Purple Noon. Eliot Sumner here was lifeless throughout and woefully miscast.What a shame.	try make artistic impression black white huge mistake film amalfi coast naple less extent rome film say tv show look sterile flat shoot iphone edit b w filter act equally pale andrew scott ripley passable aside italian character actor fine performance self consciously flat bad part freddie mile fantastic character act opportunity evidence philip seymour hoffman talente mr ripley even less extent billy kearn purple noon eliot sumner lifeless throughout woefully miscast shame
0	"Don't bother watching ""Sugar"", unless you like utterly underwhelming shows. The pacing dragged, with scenes stretching out longer than necessary. As for Farrell's performance, he just didn't bring it this time, sadly. It felt like he was sleepwalking through the role. And with his character feeling so lifeless, I simply did not care for his plight. The premise seemed interesting, but found myself amazed that the team behind Sugar could make a series about a private detective so boring. Usually, I give a series at least two or three episodes, but I couldn't even make it past the pilot for this one. There's simply no pathway for improvement in this show short of a complete overhaul.Because of the slow pace and Farrell's anemic performance, I found myself zoning out more often than not, straining to muster up any interest in what was happening on screen. It's the kind of series that feels like a struggle to watch, rather than a pleasure. This show should have been called Valium rather than Sugar."	bother watch sugar unless like utterly underwhelme show pace drag scene stretch long necessary farrell performance bring time sadly feel like sleepwalk role character feel lifeless simply care plight premise seem interest find amaze team behind sugar could make series private detective bore usually give series least two three episode even make past pilot one simply pathway improvement show short complete overhaul slow pace farrell anemic performance find zone often strain muster interest happen screen kind series feel like struggle watch rather pleasure show call valium rather sugar
1	Season 8 ruined everything for me. What was once an entertaining show with solid writing and thrilling character arcs was reduced to nothing more than a Hallmark-type fantasy flick where logic or continuity had no room. Unfortunately, HBO took GOT's fans for granted and let two incompetent writers ruin the show completely. There's a petition calling for a remake of Season 8. It has garnered a significant number of signatures. I don't think this is gonna happen though. The damage has been done. It's permanent and cannot be undone. We waited two years for this season. We anticipated greatness. I mean it's only six episodes. How hard can it be? You had plenty of time to produce something epic. But mediocrity and stupidity is all we got. Shame!	season ruin everything entertain show solid write thrill character arc reduce nothing hallmark type fantasy flick logic continuity room unfortunately hbo take get fan grant let two incompetent writer ruin show completely petition call remake season garner significant number signature think go to happen though damage do permanent undo wait two year season anticipate greatness mean six episode hard plenty time produce something epic mediocrity stupidity get shame

Much like the death of Ned Stark which brought us sadness, and Robs rebellion which brought us hope.And everything was going well for a while. We made our theories. We started building upon our imagination. It was all going so well.And then the Red Wedding a.k.a. Season 8 came.The slaughter of the Northmen symbolizes the slaughter writers were doing to the storyline, writing as well as killing a bunch of characters during season 8.Catylns threats to kill Freys wife is us making a petition for a better ending. And Frey saying ""I'll find another"" symbolizes HBO saying we'll just make more prequels and sequels.Finally, Rob further represents the entire fan base and Roose Bolton stabbing him and taking his life represents Dan and Dave who literally took our hearts and love for this TV Show with this ending.*Dan and Dave Send Their Regards*"	perfectly describe entire series comparison episode red we d entire series up down death beloved character dissapoinment excitement much like death ned stark bring we sadness rob rebellion bring we hope everything go well make theory start build upon imagination go well red we d k season come slaughter northman symbolize slaughter writer storyline write well kill bunch character season catylns threat kill freys wife we make petition well end frey say find another symbolize hbo say make prequel sequel finally rob represent entire fan base roose bolton stab take life represent dan dave literally take heart love tv show end dan dave send regard

0	When 37 years old woman acts and tries to be something like 27 i find it very very very disturbing. You can see the wrinkles from 'Meredith's' face and you can even understand by looking the series that she is really about same age as 'Bailey'.Same goes to 'Cristina' here. There's also 10 years too much but it doesn't show as bad as with 'Meredith'. 'Izzie' looks like a real woman, and what a surprise. She really is about same age as she acts to be. But in real life... 9 years younger than 'Meredith'. How really can directors and producers approve this kind of scam and think that all ppl looking at this are blind and really can't see the wrinkles around 'Meredith's' eyes.Over-aged actors here give me the creeps. 50% of the script has some point and if the series only had a better actor on the leading role, this could go between lunch and evening snack. With present... I can only hope that producers stop accepting >10 years too old ppl for roles. Thank you, next series.	year old woman act try something like find disturb see wrinkle meredith face even understand look series really age bailey go cristina also year much show bad meredith izzie look like real woman surprise really age act real life year young meredith really director producer approve kind scam think ppl look blind really see wrinkle around meredith eye age actor give creep script point series well actor lead role could go lunch even snack present hope producer stop accept year old ppl role thank next series

1	This used to be a great TV show in seasons one and two. From there it's had it's ups and downs before but never as bad as this season. The 'Chenford' relationship is not good. I always thought they had more of a brother sister relationship and seeing those two making out is a bit creepy. The over done Bailey story lines are not good. First they portrayed her as super woman and then she suddenly didn't have enough sense to know the difference between a puppy and a coyote. The new Rookie and her silly psychic abilities are getting old and need to be toned way down. Hopefully they get some new writers soon and put this show back on track before it gets any goofier.	use great tv show season one two up down never bad season chenford relationship good always think brother sister relationship see two make bite creepy do bailey story line good first portray super woman suddenly enough sense know difference puppy coyote new rookie silly psychic ability get old need tone way hopefully get new writer soon put show back track get goofy

0	There's good and there's not so good things, subjectively speaking ofc, and the not so good things make me question if I want to continue after the second episode.The good - the plot's arch sparks some interest by leaving some things hanging that engage the viewer. The structure of the narration seems to work fairly well. The world is build okay, it's not bad.The not so good - the characters lack personal depth. They feel like action movie characters. Fair enough, this seems like largely action based series, although somewhere labeled as drama. The world could be more grim. The humour often feels lazy, unimaginative and immature.This feels like an action game turned into a film, not a film based on a game. This feels shallow. Granted, I've only played the two first Fallout games, so maybe this series stays more loyal to the latter ones, but I really don't feel like this cartoonish action-based approach would convey the spirit of the two first. And beyond being a Fallout game on a film, this series seems to have little to offer to anyone else than the fans of the games.	good good thing subjectively speak ofc good thing make question want continue second episode good plot arch spark interest leave thing hang engage viewer structure narration seem work fairly well world build okay bad good character lack personal depth feel like action movie character fair enough seem like largely action base series although somewhere label drama world could grim humour often feel lazy unimaginative immature feel like action game turn film film base game feel shallow grant play two first fallout game maybe series stay loyal latter one really feel like cartoonish action base approach would convey spirit two first beyond fallout game film series seem little offer anyone else fan game
0	I didn't see the original series in the 80's. I'm 40. I didn't read the book. Not my genre. However, I was looking forward to this and a new entertaining series for spring. Wrong. This show is an absolute snooze fest. My number one complaint is the subtitles. Most of the show is in Japanese with English subtitles. I want to watch a movie. Not read a movie. If I wanted to read a movie I'd get the book. Watched episode one figuring it would improve. As episode two ended I realized it was again full of subtitles and I had slept throw 1/3 of it. None of the characters are likeable. Its just overall boring.	see original series read book genre however look forward new entertain series spring wrong show absolute snooze fest number one complaint subtitle show japanese english subtitle want watch movie read movie want read movie get book watch episode one figure would improve episode two end realize full subtitle sleep throw none character likeable overall bore
2	GOT is consider to be one of the best TV series and that is for a reason, first excellent and extraordinary cast, second brilliant story and third for its direction. If we look at the opening seasons the story built by the show is up to the mark which sets the bar, way high and as the shows go on the character build by the writers and screenplay by the directors are good. For its story hands off to George RR Martin. But in the last season to end the show in limited episodes they screw the story and to create an unexpected ending they deviate the whole story. At last, I want to tell my best character in GOT- Tyrion Lannister(Peter Dinklage) bcoz of its cunningness, acting and dialogue delivery.

1	"'3 body Problem' is an odd mix of great, mediocre, and sometimes frustrating. The general story, along with the arresting visuals, definitely keep you coming back for more. The ideas and concepts are catnip to any science fiction fan. The characters, on the other hand, are an entirely different ball game. Almost all of the leads are selfish, self-centred, self-righteous and often obnoxious.From what little I've read, it appears they're a major departure from the books, which I will admit I haven't read yet (Though I'm curious now). Of the 'scientists', the most interesting character is killed early on. The rest are a mix of self-absorbed narcissists, and far too controlled by their random emotions.Fate of the world at stake? Nah, I don't won't want to help, it's too much responsibility. All humans going to be eradicated? That's fine, because it's way off in the future, who cares about them? All of human civilisation and your descendants to be destroyed by heartless aliens? Well, my superior did something harsh but necessary to try and combat a seemingly unstoppable threat to all humanity, so I'm going to act morally superior and not help by spitting my dummy out.There also seems to be an obsession with Netflix (and Amazon) of having characters casually doing illicit substances all the time, as if it adds anything whatsoever to the characters or situation beyond making them feel even more weak-willed and pathetic.Of the non-scientist characters, Wade (Liam Cunningham) and Shi (Benedict Wong) are by far the most interesting. Both are struggling to get a handle on an impossible, unknown threat, and doing their best to fight it. Sometimes that means making the most horrific decisions for the greater good. That moral grey area could have made for some interesting conversations with the other leads who felt squeamish, but instead it just ends up with them being high-and-mighty and acting morally superior. Never once did anyone sit down and say ""Okay, what would you suggest? Is this terrible? Yes. Did we have a choice, fighting this enemy, given what is at stake and the odds against us?""Ultimately, it also feels a little aimless and lacklustre. The big event that this series was leading up to failed. In addition, far too much time was spent on a rather boring character leading into it. (I have little doubt that character will 'return' in season two, but at this point it makes it all feel pointless).For an introductory series, it fails to give a sense of satisfying conclusion. You can have a story where the heroes 'fail' in order to make their success all the more satisfying down the line, but when they fail so spectacularly at the first hurdle it just feels a bit pointless. Having said all that, the interesting ideas and concepts make it worth watching, and at least it wasn't superheroes..."	body problem odd mix great mediocre sometimes frustrate general story along arrest visual definitely keep come back idea concept catnip science fiction fan character hand entirely different ball game almost lead selfish self centre self righteous often obnoxious little read appear major departure book admit read yet though curious scientist interest character kill early rest mix self absorb narcissist far control random emotion fate world stake nah want help much responsibility human go eradicate fine way future care human civilisation descendant destroy heartless alien well superior something harsh necessary try combat seemingly unstoppable threat humanity go act morally superior help spit dummy also seem obsession netflix amazon character casually illicit substance time add anything whatsoever character situation beyond make feel even weak will pathetic non scientist character wade liam cunningham shi benedict wong far interest struggle get handle impossible unknown threat good fight sometimes mean make horrific decision great good moral grey area could make interest conversation lead feel squeamish instead end high mighty act morally superior never anyone sit say okay would suggest terrible yes choice fight enemy give stake odd we ultimately also feel little aimless lacklustre big event series lead fail addition far much time spend rather bore character lead little doubt character return season two point make feel pointless introductory series fail give sense satisfy conclusion story hero fail order make success satisfy line fail spectacularly first hurdle feel bite pointless say interest idea concept make worth watch least superhero
0	What's all the hype about, you ask? Why are all the nerds giggling like a 5 year old? Well that's because th 3 body series is one of the greatest pieces of science fiction literature in recent history. The books are deeply imaginative, philosophical and ponder some very interesting questions relating to the universe and extra terrestrial life.Now, If you haven't read the book(s) then it's a totally different thing and the show isn't half as bad and it's something you'll watch once and enjoy and that's about it.Understandably, they've changed the setting and added some bits to make it work as a TV adaptation but it has more than a few pitfalls:1. The motley crew of main characters feel generic and there's too much drama thrown in with little time spent on developing them.2. The above said actors have done a very sub par job and you don't feel any connection to them.3. There is this sense of existential dread and fear of the unknown you get when you read the book. By adding needless (and poorly done) humour it breaks whatever little tension that has built up.But to be fair they've done a great job with how they've shown the backstory of Ye Wenjie, all that's been done beautifully.It's not an easy book to adapt to TV by any measure but trying to cater to a wide general population has turned this into a tasteless mish mash that doesn't satisfy anyone.	hype ask nerd giggle like year old well th body series one great piece science fiction literature recent history book deeply imaginative philosophical ponder interest question relate universe extra terrestrial life read book totally different thing show half bad something watch enjoy understandably change set add bit make work tv adaptation pitfall motley crew main character feel generic much drama throw little time spend develop say actor do sub par job feel connection sense existential dread fear unknown get read book add needle poorly do humour break whatever little tension build fair do great job show backstory ye wenjie do beautifully easy book adapt tv measure try cater wide general population turn tasteless mish mash satisfy anyone
2	Translating a complex Sci-Fi book with abstract concepts and make it engaging is a mind boggling task at the least. I'm glad to say the series has done its level best to visualise it. It's captivating, dumbs down the scientific concepts involved AND keeps it interesting. Though not all elements are brought onto the screen, it's understandable, compared to the genre difference between GOT and 3BP. At the end of episode 8, I was craving for more. The stark balance between science and the human emotions is thought proving. Season 1 ending made me crave for more of the story to be brought to the screen.To the reviews which state the series is not true to the source material, honestly, it's an unrealistic expectation considering the concepts and the grand scale of the series. It's a catch-22. Making the series too complicated alienates the casual viewership thus reducing the chances of an another season. Making a lean version of the series potentially leads to low ratings from the book readers. Considering the source material's complexity to get it on screen, I for one, would vouch for more seasons with the core concepts of the books being unchanged while taking the creative liberties needed to ensure the series gets it's due closure!	translate complex sci fi book abstract concept make engage mind boggle task least glad say series do level good visualise captivate dumb scientific concept involve keep interest though element bring onto screen understandable compare genre difference get bp end episode crave stark balance science human emotion think prove season end make crave story bring screen review state series true source material honestly unrealistic expectation consider concept grand scale series catch make series complicate alienate casual viewership thus reduce chance another season make lean version series potentially lead low rat book reader consider source material complexity get screen one would vouch season core concept book unchanged take creative liberty need ensure series get due closure
0	The first two seasons are very good, and then it just goes downhill from there. Season 3 is not as bad as season 4 and absolutely not ad bad ad season 5. Season 3 has some pretty dumb episodes though, and maybe they should be seen as a warning for whats to come. Especially episode 7 in season 3 is a lowpoint in that season. Season 4 gets annoying cause it's filled with men vs. Women or system vs. Women agendas. So it gets pretty woke. In the middle of season everything becomes much dumber, and the lovestory between Lucy and Tim is like soapopera. It's cheap. Throughout the series, I've been wondering how bad the cops and robbers are at shooting. There is a lot of shootouts, but they almost never hit eachother. In season 5 episode 8 Lucy and a suspect gets into a shootout, and there is litteraly only 1 meter and no cover between them. They fire a lot of rounds at eachother, but no one gets hit. How is that possible? I can't wait to see the next dumb thing happening.	first two season good go downhill season bad season absolutely ad bad ad season season pretty dumb episode though maybe see warn what s come especially episode season lowpoint season season get annoy cause fill man vs woman system vs woman agenda get pretty wake middle season everything become much dumb lovestory lucy tim like soapopera cheap throughout series wonder bad cop robber shoot lot shootout almost never hit eachother season episode lucy suspect get shootout litteraly meter cover fire lot round eachother one get hit possible wait see next dumb thing happen

0	"As a fan of Liu Cixin's renowned science fiction novel ""The Three-Body Problem,"" I was eager to delve into the recently adapted series that promised to bring this complex tale to life. However, what I encountered was a disappointing departure from the core essence of the characters and themes.One of the most striking misinterpretations was the portrayal of the main character's disillusionment with humanity. In the novel, her despair stems from profound philosophical and existential questions about the nature of civilization and morality. Yet, in the series, this was overshadowed by a focus on her romantic relationships, reducing her struggles to superficial romantic entanglements.The title ""The Three-Body Problem"" alludes to a complex astrophysical phenomenon, symbolizing the intricate challenges faced by civilizations. However, the adaptation reduced this to a literal interpretation of ""three human bodies"".Another letdown was the subpar special effects, especially considering the reported budget of 20 million. The visual portrayal of advanced civilizations and scientific concepts fell short, failing to immerse viewers in the awe-inspiring world envisioned by Liu Cixin.Furthermore, the series seemed to reflect a limited understanding of cultural and historical contexts. The emphasis on Western perspectives and a reductionist view of human emotions undermined the depth and universality of the story, highlighting a lack of cultural nuance."	fan liu cixin renowne science fiction novel three body problem eager delve recently adapt series promise bring complex tale life however encounter disappoint departure core essence character theme one strike misinterpretation portrayal main character disillusionment humanity novel despair stem profound philosophical existential question nature civilization morality yet series overshadow focus romantic relationship reduce struggle superficial romantic entanglement title three body problem allude complex astrophysical phenomenon symbolize intricate challenge face civilization however adaptation reduce literal interpretation three human body another letdown subpar special effect especially consider report budget million visual portrayal advance civilizations scientific concept fall short fail immerse viewer awe inspire world envision liu cixin furthermore series seem reflect limit understand cultural historical contexts emphasis western perspective reductionist view human emotion undermine depth universality story highlight lack cultural nuance

Wasn't ruining ""Game of Thrones"" enough? After watching all 8 episodes, these two writers give me the impression that they haven't even read the classic ""The Three-Body Problem"" but merely glanced through someone's brief summary on TikTok, then combined it with their limited intelligence to create this TV series. If Liu Cixin, the author of The Three-Body Problem, had used the script written by these two superficial screenwriters, he would definitely not have been able to win the Hugo Award, and his status in the science fiction community would have plummeted to the bottom."	another typical tv series adapt haphazardly base one imagination feel turn masterpiece sci fi world mediocre production ruin game throne enough watch episode two writer give impression even read classic three body problem merely glance someone brief summary tiktok combine limit intelligence create tv series liu cixin author three body problem use script write two superficial screenwriter would definitely able win hugo award status science fiction community would plummet bottom

While some appreciate the juxtaposition of punchlines amidst the apocalypse, others find it jarring. The show's tone resembles a bipolar wasteland, leaving viewers disoriented and disconnected.Plot Potholes: The narrative stumbles like a ghoul with a broken leg. Instead of weaving a compelling story within the established Fallout universe, the show opts for a new tale.Unfortunately, it lacks depth and coherence.

The show was artistic, psychological and immensely entertaining. I enjoyed the 1990d version but this might top it for me. I was impressed by the way things came out at the end that made me rethinking earlier conversations in the show. The back and white picture is was also perfect. The way they did the subtitles was impressive. Overall, you have to give the producers credit for how they were able to create something fresh and new from a story that's been told well before.	series fantastic adaption actor play ripley nail role really start appreciate act show go show artistic psychological immensely entertain enjoy version might top impress way thing come end make rethink early conversation show back white picture also perfect way subtitle impressive overall give producer credit able create something fresh new story tell well
0	"Sorry, the following is an AI translation Lack of scientific literacy and illogical reasoning. The artificial intelligence of the human computer has become a sign, which even makes the computer logic wrong. Apart from black and white, there are also double black and double white and no sign, without such basic scientific literacy.And the flicker of the universe, visible to the naked eye? Can you tell me how Zhizi can do it? The Tencent version still needs to be observed through 3k glasses, which turns you into the naked eye. It lacks scientific literacy and goes against the horror of the original work that ""the entire universe only flickers for you."".And the Red Bank base is transmitting signals, but Ye Wenjie and his team are actually standing directly under the radar? The director obviously doesn't know how much microwave radiation this radar has, because with his scientific literacy, he can only understand what is visible. Is it difficult to use one's brain to think about whether a person standing below would suffer serious harm, even if the death of a flying bird is clearly displayed? A science fiction work with so many low-level errors is like elementary school students telling stories, terrible!The changes to the characters also completely lose their complexity. Although Ye Wenjie suffered persecution during the Cultural Revolution, she lost hope for human self rescue. But she is a savior rather than a descendant, believing that Trisolarans have a higher moral level to transform humanity. In the hands of Netflix, there is only bitter hatred left, and the flat character design has made her lose her charm. Many characters have lost their charm, and the director cannot understand the complexity of their thoughts. He can only use plain behavior to show his first impression of the characters, and interpret this excellent work in the form of low-quality fast food. This is the tragedy of the Three Body Problem book Poor quality special effects, the special effects of the flying blade cutting ship are like CG from ten years ago, and the reason for choosing flying blade cutting in the original work is: 1. There are very few innocent people on the ship, only one canal navigator, minimizing innocent casualties. 2. The movement is small, and the speed is fast. Can avoid discovering and destroying hard drive data in Evans. There has been a complete change here, with so many children on board. Is this ETO headquarters or a primary school outing yacht? Killing so many innocent people is an insult to this plan. And Evans has such a long reaction time, even holding data in his arms. Why didn't he destroy it? It is illogical to turn such a clever plan from the original work into a vulgar American disaster film."	sorry follow ai translation lack scientific literacy illogical reason artificial intelligence human computer become sign even make computer logic wrong apart black white also double black double white sign without basic scientific literacy flicker universe visible naked eye tell zhizi tencent version still need observe k glass turn naked eye lack scientific literacy go horror original work entire universe flicker red bank base transmit signal ye wenjie team actually stand directly radar director obviously know much microwave radiation radar scientific literacy understand visible difficult use one brain think whether person stand would suffer serious harm even death fly bird clearly display science fiction work many low level error like elementary school student tell story terrible change character also completely lose complexity although ye wenjie suffer persecution cultural revolution lose hope human self rescue savior rather descendant believe trisolaran high moral level transform humanity hand netflix bitter hatred leave flat character design make lose charm many character lose charm director understand complexity thought use plain behavior show first impression character interpret excellent work form low quality fast food tragedy three body problem book poor quality special effect special effect fly blade cut ship like cg ten year ago reason choose fly blade cut original work innocent people ship one canal navigator minimize innocent casualty movement small speed fast avoid discover destroy hard drive datum evan complete change many child board eto headquarter primary school out yacht kill many innocent people insult plan evans long reaction time even hold datum arm destroy illogical turn clever plan original work vulgar american disaster film

He's so good at what he does that he doesn't need to take any other kind of private detective work. And he has perfect integrity. He sees a homeless person on the street and goes out of his way to rehabilitate him and reunite him with his family. He won't have sex with a woman if she's drunk. He doesn't like carrying a gun. We're supposed to believe he's a saint. Sorry, not convincing but rather off-putting.

2	"I've think the show is amazing, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it. But when it first started with only two episodes out, I couldn't help but feel the need to tell some people to pipe down a bit. Calling it next Game of Thrones already. Since GOT ended, there's been a flood of shows and movies being dubbed as the new Game of Thrones. Sometimes it's Game of Thrones with pirates like ""Black Sails"", or Game of Thrones in space, as seen in ""Dune"" and Apple TV's ""Foundation."" Other times, shows like ""Wheel of Time"" and ""The Witcher"" received comparisons that eventually died down. Don't get me wrong, I actually like all of those, but I'm just a bit tired of the ""this is the new GOT!!"" hype.But this show is actually quite good and refreshingly different, especially since it's set in Japan. Starting to admire Anna Sawai, having seen her in Monarch Legacy and now in Shogun. Apparently, she was also in F9. The show delves into a lot of Japanese lore, like beliefs and samurai culture, although I can't vouch for its accuracy. I've learned a lot about Japanese culture, particularly their dedication to rituals and customs. Hiroyuki Sanada seems to have a penchant for playing samurai or sword fighters: 47 Ronin (2013), John wick, bullet train, mortal combat, avengers endgame.Despite my reservations about calling it the next Game of Thrones, the show does have a strong political undertone, with different factions vying for power and the looming threat of civil war. Something small that I like was the show's title sequence.While the show is generally well-executed, it feels a bit odd to have the Japanese characters speaking Japanese and the Portuguese speaking Portuguese, yet having Portuguese dialogue in English lol. Japanese is subtitles. There are some things I might have missed explanations for, like the peculiar condition of Regent Ohno's skin.Many people compare it to Game of Thrones, but I find it more akin to Vikings, albeit less violent than expected. It leans more towards being a political drama at the moment, although there are hints of impending war. My only gripe is that it seems to shy away from on-screen violence, with many fights and deaths occurring off-screen. It's gory at times, but it teases so many epic battles and wars, and with one episode left, we still only get glimpses of them. Even if the last episode is just one epic battle sequence, I'll still feel the same.Now, I absolutely adore this show. It's a rare case, akin to ""Godzilla: Minus One,"" where the show/movie perfectly hits its target audience. ""Godzilla: Minus One"" was almost exclusively watched by fans of Godzilla and similar genres (myself included); everyone watching knows what to expect. I believe Shogun is predominantly being watched by its intended audience. Even though a show or movie can be amazing, it's very rare for it to receive purely positive reviews. And I think that's what's happening with Shogun - it's an amazing show mainly being watched by its target audience."	think show amaze thoroughly enjoy first start two episode help feel need tell people pipe bite call next game throne already since get end flood show movie dub new game throne sometimes game throne pirate like black sail game throne space see dune apple tv foundation time show like wheel time witcher receive comparison eventually die get wrong actually like bite tire new get hype show actually quite good refreshingly different especially since set japan start admire anna sawai see monarch legacy shogun apparently also f show delve lot japanese lore like beliefs samurai culture although vouch accuracy learn lot japanese culture particularly dedication rituals customs hiroyuki sanada seem penchant play samurai sword fighter ronin john wick bullet train mortal combat avenger endgame despite reservation call next game throne show strong political undertone different faction vie power loom threat civil war something small like show title sequence show generally well execute feel bite odd japanese character speak japanese portuguese speak portuguese yet portuguese dialogue english lol japanese subtitle thing might miss explanation like peculiar condition regent ohno skin many people compare game throne find akin viking albeit less violent expect lean towards political drama moment although hint impend war gripe seem shy away screen violence many fight death occur screen gory time tease many epic battle war one episode leave still get glimpse even last episode one epic battle sequence still feel absolutely adore show rare case akin godzilla minus one show movie perfectly hit target audience godzilla minus one almost exclusively watch fan godzilla similar genre include everyone watch know expect believe shogun predominantly watch intend audience even though show movie amaze rare receive purely positive review think happen shogun amaze show mainly watch target audience
1	"SPOILERSBut he is not likeable at all really, terrible comedian, uses people in order to make himself feel better constantly, does a lot of stupid things and messes his life up and then wants sympathy for doing so.Halfway through the show he says ""how can I report her and not him"" (Both did bad things to the MC). And then proceeds to not only report her, but go and APOLOGISE to him at the end of the show despite him being significantly WORSE than the stalker!!And then keep listening to her voicemails for validation that he is an alright bloke, after sending her to jail for sending them, but the REAL main villain gets no consequences, he actually gets REWARDED.MC keeps insisting he needs to stay where he is and not do anything to change the situation, insisting that he can't because he can't afford to, despite his family offering him to come home for free and being very supportive in the scenes they are featured in.Show is weirdly transphobic in places, (MC needs to imagine that his partner is literally his horrible stalker in order to finish amongst other things), but also wants to dedicate swathes of time to us feeling sorry that his partner got misgendered by a mentally ill woman, not that she was assaulted and physically harmed?The same partner who was attacked and refuses to go to the police and report it but keeps yelling at the main character to report it, but he won't because he is enjoying the attention from the stalker. Why wouldn't you just go and report your own assault at that point?I mean the main saving grace of the show is that the main character acknowledges how he has contributed to his own downfall and that he has been loving the attention, but its then instantly taken away by him going to apologise and accept to work with the guy again.I gave it a 5 because the show is actually quite gripping and I do feel sorry for the circumstances that occurred, the MC, who this is based on a true story by, gives a fantastic performance, I am sure spurred on by experiencing this in his real life, you can feel his pain at times. The lady who plays the stalker is also fantastic, she is probably the best character in the show, despite only being present for just over half of it."	spoilersbut likeable really terrible comedian use people order make feel well constantly lot stupid thing mess life want sympathy halfway show say report bad thing mc proceed report go apologise end show despite significantly bad stalker keep listen voicemail validation alright bloke send jail send real main villain get consequence actually get reward mc keep insist need stay anything change situation insist afford despite family offer come home free supportive scene feature show weirdly transphobic place mc need imagine partner literally horrible stalker order finish amongst thing also want dedicate swathe time we feel sorry partner get misgendere mentally ill woman assault physically harm partner attack refuse go police report keep yell main character report enjoy attention stalker go report assault point mean main save grace show main character acknowledge contribute downfall love attention instantly take away go apologise accept work guy give show actually quite grip feel sorry circumstance occur mc base true story give fantastic performance sure spur experience real life feel pain time lady play stalker also fantastic probably good character show despite present half
0	"Glad I waited to give a review because this season ruins anything and everything I've always loved about this show. It's a joke. Meredith down and out for SEVERAL episodes because of COVID and the shows script writers forcing the characters to relentlessly shout about ""systemic racism"". It's cringe worthy. This COVID/RACISM let's beat a dead horse season is the worst thing I've ever seen happen in this show. Like, WE GET IT. Shut up already. Truly sad. I would prefer to rewatch Derek pass 4 more times than subject myself to this brand of torture. Also, I couldn't stand Maggie from day 1 and she has NEVER had a redemptive character arc. She's a spoiled, self entitled, utterly PRESUMPTUOUS, gets-the-award-for-the-single-most-ANNOYING effing character ever to smear television with BRAT. Wish they kept DeLuca and got rid of her. Maybe if they write her character off I'll try season 18."	glad wait give review season ruin anything everything always love show joke meredith several episode covid show script writer force character relentlessly shout systemic racism cringe worthy covid racism let beat dead horse season bad thing ever see happen show like get shut already truly sad would prefer rewatch derek pass time subject brand torture also stand maggie day never redemptive character arc spoil self entitle utterly presumptuous get award single annoy eff character ever smear television brat wish keep deluca get rid maybe write character try season
0	I watched the first 4 series in one breath. Captured strong emotions, character's personalities, expressive acting . Looking through keyhole into strangers' dramas makes your blood boil. I've forced myself to watch the last 3 series to decide whether to add Richard Gard to my list of director-favourites, new talents. No, I will not.The last series, the streams of crocodile tears, Donny Dunn's boring face, stiff as a crumpled pillow , the hastily wrapped up plot reminded me of a Brazilian primitive soap opera or Tik Tok clips.Very very pity for the time wasted. The cinematographic value is z-e-r-o, a jumble of stereotypes. Much has already been seen. Stand-up comedian's tragic dramas, expressive del arte style, part of the scenes in Leos Carax's feerie Annette. Back in 2007, cinematic genius Hector Babenco brilliantly revealed how a stalker in love ruthlessly destroys a man's life. Watch his artistic masterpiece El Pasado with Garcia Bernal.Baby Reindeer will grow in popularity among the social network lusers. Those who have no active, interesting real life. They will recognise their complexes, traumas, loneliness, fears, infantilism, addictions in the neuroses and obsessions of mentally deranged characters. In this sense, film is psychotherapeutic. It can be excellent tool for psychotherapists. If they have, of course, the patience to follow Donny's backstage, extended, paranoid, boring monologue.	watch first series one breath capture strong emotion character personality expressive act look keyhole stranger drama make blood boil force watch last series decide whether add richard gard list director favourite new talent last series stream crocodile tear donny dunn bore face stiff crumple pillow hastily wrap plot remind brazilian primitive soap opera tik tok clip pity time waste cinematographic value z e r jumble stereotype much already see stand comedian tragic drama expressive del arte style part scene leos carax feerie annette back cinematic genius hector babenco brilliantly reveal stalker love ruthlessly destroy man life watch artistic masterpiece el pasado garcia bernal baby reindeer grow popularity among social network luser active interest real life recognise complex traumas loneliness fear infantilism addiction neurose obsession mentally derange character sense film psychotherapeutic excellent tool psychotherapist course patience follow donny backstage extend paranoid bore monologue
1	I recently caught the Fallout TV series and it's definitely an interesting watch. There were moments that felt a tad cringey, especially with some of the acting, but I have to admit, the gore was on point. It's a bit of a mixed bag - some scenes really nail it, while others fall a bit short. Still, I'd say it's worth giving it a shot. Personally, I found myself enjoying it despite the occasional awkward performance. You can tell they really invested heavily in production - the sets, props, and effects are top-notch. Surprisingly, it exceeded my expectations. That said, there's room for improvement, particularly in the acting department. It feels like they may have prioritized visuals over casting, but hey, it worked out pretty well in the end. Overall, a solid effort, but there's definitely potential for even greater things with some tweaks here and there.	recently catch fallout tv series definitely interest watch moment feel tad cringey especially act admit gore point bite mix bag scene really nail other fall bite short still say worth give shoot personally find enjoy despite occasional awkward performance tell really invest heavily production set prop effect top notch surprisingly exceed expectation say room improvement particularly act department feel like may prioritize visual cast hey work pretty well end overall solid effort definitely potential even great thing tweak
2	This was both easy & hard to watch.Easy because the pacing, narrating, acting were spot on. None of the dull pointless fillers. And the way the story unfolded and revealed things will keep you hooked.Hard watch because well, it is dark, very dark. Plus it's based on a true story with the main actor as the same guy in real life. The human complexity & psychology, the vulnerable subjects were all handled quite well.Sometimes you can't believe this happened to a person, but then you remember life is stranger than fiction. The ending really moved me.I highly recommend you give this a try. I didn't expect it to be that good.	easy hard watch easy pace narrate act spot none dull pointless filler way story unfold reveal thing keep hook hard watch well dark dark plus base true story main actor guy real life human complexity psychology vulnerable subject handle quite well sometimes believe happen person remember life strange fiction end really move highly recommend give try expect good

I ended up disliking everyone..especially Donny. I gave up caring about the outcome, and after episode 3 just found myself watching episodes..4..5..6! Whilst scrolling on my phone. Did it go to episode six? God knows..it all just melted into this self pitying gumbo. The woman who played His stalker Martha is the highlight, she is a fantastic actor, and She carried this whole thing..if she wasn't so believable then this would have fallen apart.	potentially interest story stretch elongate confuse mess typical netflix entirely sure suppose empathise story end dislike everyone especially donny give care outcome episode find watch episode whilst scroll phone go episode six god know melt self pity gumbo woman play stalker martha highlight fantastic actor carry whole thing believable would fall apart

1	My grade was 6 because I judged the series with a technical eye, and I came to the conclusion that technically the series' script is standardized and predictable, at several moments I was able to deduce what was going to happen. Other than that, the series has a good pace at times, at others not so much like the last episode of the first season where at times the scenes were very slow. The positive points are the scenarios, battles, references to the game, the humor and the atmosphere. The script between the future and the past was ok. The final revelation that the protagonist's father is behind everything was really cool. The script greatly favors the protagonists, so it is clear that it is a predictable and ok script. The creatures are a good positive point, but we didn't have many on the scene. The ending leaves a hint for a possible season. Well, there are several points to consider but I will just leave these comments from my perspective.	grade judge series technical eye come conclusion technically series script standardize predictable several moment able deduce go happen series good pace time other much like last episode first season time scene slow positive point scenario battle reference game humor atmosphere script future past ok final revelation protagonist father behind everything really cool script greatly favor protagonist clear predictable ok script creature good positive point many scene end leave hint possible season well several point consider leave comment perspective

2	"It's really wild to think that this would be the project that Jonathan Nolan would hang his hat on and say ""Hey now this! This is something!"" And throughout watching the season I couldn't quite tell if this was the product of someone who lived the games or Todd Howard himself, and it turns out it was Todd Howard himself. But to reduce this show down to a comparison to The Last of Us wouldn't do the show justice by any means. This takes the spirit of the games, along with its humor, and runs with it. Lisa Joy, Jonathan Nolan, and Co. Weave a such a well crafted season of television that it makes me ashamed to say I even doubted the duo that crafted the first season of Westworld. There's a world that I want to stretch a lawn chair out in and sit back with my Nuka Cola.Ella Purnells Lucy is a warm center to anchor this story in. Surrounded with excellent characters like Moises Arias' Norm and, of course, the selling point of the show. Walton Goggins' Ghoul of a character makes me want scream Yee Haw and run through the desert buck naked.I can't wait to see what happens with the rest of this shows life. Whether it suffer the fate of so many other Amazon Prime shows, or god forbid, befall the fate of a show like The Boys. I just hope we can revel in this fun world that the Nolan's have made for a good time.

2	If you're a vault dweller like me, you will have played Fallout since it first came out as an RPG back in the 90s. A sprawling and somewhat overwhelming game with a rich world and fantastic characters.It is the gem in Bethesda's catalogue.With other games receiving the Hollywood treatment, it was only time before someone took this on. Enter Johnathon Nolan.If you aren't a fan, I would suggest you search for a short introduction to the world of Fallout, but, it can be hard to follow with such a soup of themes and stories.This is well worth a watch nonetheless. It has Nolan-esque tropes and plays with time and theme.It can be a little hard to follow, and the action is taut and straight out of the playbook. Fallout has enough references and thematic callbacks, that it is hard not to like.The characters are written well, the dialogue is good, the story is true to the lore of Fallout, and the set is particularly rewarding.Walter Goggins is a fantastic actor and he carries a lot of the charm on his shoulders. As for the rest of the cast, they each perform their pieces with plum.The music, CGI and sound design are all of a fine standard, and despite Amazon's many fails, this could very well be a hit. Just as long as they don't drag it out and go meme hunting like Rings of Power.If there is any criticism, it would be that there could have been more of a callback to VATS and the gaming element. This does not detract however, as it is important to know that this is a serial and not a game.Give it a go and make your own mind up. However, it is hard to not like this show for the characters collective journeys.	vault dweller like play fallout since first come rpg back sprawl somewhat overwhelm game rich world fantastic character gem bethesda catalogue game receive hollywood treatment time someone take enter johnathon nolan fan would suggest search short introduction world fallout hard follow soup theme story well worth watch nonetheless nolan esque trope play time theme little hard follow action taut straight playbook fallout enough reference thematic callback hard like character write well dialogue good story true lore fallout set particularly reward walter goggin fantastic actor carry lot charm shoulder rest cast perform piece plum music cgi sound design fine standard despite amazon many fail could well hit long drag go meme hunt like ring power criticism would could callback vat game element detract however important know serial game give go make mind however hard like show character collective journey
1	Once again I wrote a review without watching the whole season and once again IMDb deleted that review, just like they did for 3 Body Problem.Well I have now watched the full season of Fallout because for some reason I couldn't turn it off, I kept thinking this is terrible and I should watch something else, but I just couldn't.I certainly didn't enjoy the comedy, but I did enjoy the performance of some of the actors, like Walton Goggins and Aaron Moten, but my special praise is for Ella Purnell who I thought was brilliant, so the 7 I've given it is just for Ella, I think without her I wouldn't have watched the whole series.I don't know much about the games as I've only played one of the once, and I got bored, so is this meant to have comedy?	write review without watch whole season imdb delete review like body problem well watch full season fallout reason turn keep think terrible watch something else certainly enjoy comedy enjoy performance actor like walton goggin aaron moten special praise ella purnell think brilliant give ella think without watch whole series know much game play one get bore mean comedy

There are like 1000 movies and series with the same romantic plot, why u put the most basic cliché love story in SCI FI SERIES!!!! And it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the aliens and physics of the book, why is Netflix always ruining good original material for no reason? Just to win hate and unsubscriptions? They ruined Poe novels changing everything he created, then Avatar, and now this? Why u wanna earn the hate of the public? It should be illegal to sell a series as sci fi but it's a Love Actually spin off, like this series, at least they should have put All I want for Chritsmas from Mariah Carey like in the original Love Actually movie, but they made it as bad as they could, -10/10!!

The various actions of Jon as Lord Commander of the Night Watch (Rescue of the Wildlings) and the desperate attempt to explain to others that the true war is in the north. Everything meaningless.4. The background story of the Night King was screwed up. He is abused by the children of the forest as a weapon and became independent. Why? Can he still think and feel? If so, what exactly is his motive? How could he actually survive the first long night? Will he revived all 8,000 years? So many unsolved questions.5. For what all the effort?

0	The first episode was intriguing but after that I just found the lead character to be a complete idiot. He would put himself into bad situations constantly and make dreadful decisions without considering the consequences. It wasn't funny either and the entertainment soon dried up as stupidity and unrealistic nature of the story continued. Don't waste your time, I just don't get the level of positivity.Apparently, this is based on a true story but I do not believe it for a second. Surely, nobody is stupid enough to get themselves into the situations presented in this series. I found myself not being sympathetic to the lead character but disliking him and no longer being interested in whatever happened to him. A loser!	first episode intrigue find lead character complete idiot would put bad situation constantly make dreadful decision without consider consequence funny either entertainment soon dry stupidity unrealistic nature story continue waste time get level positivity apparently base true story believe second surely nobody stupid enough get situation present series find sympathetic lead character dislike long interest whatever happen loser
1	This show came with a lot of hype, and nowadays everybody on social media is basically shilling for somebody. A show doesn't even have to be good to earn a second season, it just has to bring in enough viewers to merit a second, and the number of viewers doesn't hinge on the quality of the show, just how well it was marketed. I watched it because Sanada has a lead role and I fell for the hype.So the show has good marketing, good enough to raise expectations, but alas Shogun fails to match its hype. This is has the distinct feel of a tv show, and some of the dialogue is a bit simplistic. What really threw me was laziness that infests the show. We have Japanese actors speaking Japanese, but everyone is speaking Portuguese in English. Incredibly silly choice that completely degrades the seriousness of the show. It's a fact that the Portuguese tried to colonise Japan, so why hide from the epic scale that multiple languages would have given the show?Some of the casting gave this a Xena warrior princess feel. Perhaps it should have had a bigger budget or been made as a movie? Theres not much going on in terms of plot, and the weekly release schedule just doesn't work in today's day and age. There's just no way to remember what happened over the previous episodes if one takes a month's break.The British protestant captain is poorly cast and the acting bordering on pantomime.Japan is a stunningly beautiful county, and I think they really missed a trick with the cinematography. Nearly all the shots fail to immerse, looking like they have shot this distinctly TVesque show in a studio somewhere, rather than on location.As an aside, I'm very skeptical of reviews that rate 10 on the basis of a few episodes.	show come lot hype nowadays everybody social medium basically shill somebody show even good earn second season bring enough viewer merit second number viewer hinge quality show well market watch sanada lead role fall hype show good market good enough raise expectation alas shogun fail match hype distinct feel tv show dialogue bite simplistic really throw laziness infest show japanese actor speak japanese everyone speak portuguese english incredibly silly choice completely degrade seriousness show fact portuguese try colonise japan hide epic scale multiple language would give show cast give xena warrior princess feel perhaps big budget make movie there s much go term plot weekly release schedule work today day age way remember happen previous episode one take month break british protestant captain poorly cast act border pantomime japan stunningly beautiful county think really miss trick cinematography nearly shot fail immerse look like shoot distinctly tvesque show studio somewhere rather location aside skeptical review rate basis episode

Then it made sense.Had this been done by someone else, I could easily see it coming off as ""slow"". He knows what he is doing.The way this show is done (for some reason) is anything but slow.

0	The characters and dialogue in the 1st two seasons were not sensational, but it was the only US cop show i can recall watching and enjoying in a long time.Unfortunately, season 3 went completely off the rails with the victimhood politics and misandry. New characters are caricatures, literally all of them. Calling them cardboard cutouts would be an insult to cardboard. And dialogue seems to be written by ChatGPT trained solely on buzfeed articles.It's criminal to let such great cast and characters that were developed over the course of 2 seasons go to waste. Maybe it gets better later on? Who knows?

1	"After binge-watching the 8 episodes of Netflix's ""The Three-Body Problem,"" as someone who has read the entire trilogy and watched Tencent's series closely following the first book, I consider the Netflix adaptation to be an ""good"" level US/UK drama. For those new to the ""Three-Body"" universe, I'd rate it between 7.5 to 8. However, compared to Tencent's detailed 30-episode adaptation, Netflix's attempt to cover the first book in just 6 episodes resulted in the loss of many essences from the book. Personally, the most disappointing aspect was the portrayal of Ye Wenjie. As a core character of the trilogy, she was depicted with much more depth and conviction in both the book and Tencent's version. Netflix's portrayal, however, was quite brief and made her level ""much lower"", leaving me and many other fans a bit disappointed. Nonetheless, it's still a good watch, especially for newcomers. But if you're captivated by this amazing story, I'd definitely recommend checking out Tencent's version or reading the books."	binge watch episode netflix three body problem someone read entire trilogy watch tencent series closely follow first book consider netflix adaptation good level we uk drama new three body universe rate however compare tencent detail episode adaptation netflix attempt cover first book episode result loss many essence book personally disappoint aspect portrayal ye wenjie core character trilogy depict much depth conviction book tencent version netflix portrayal however quite brief make level much low leave many fan bite disappoint nonetheless still good watch especially newcomer captivate amaze story definitely recommend check tencent version read book
0	"Almost all of the science in the book is missing from this ""science"" fiction adaptation. For example, the countdown that is introduced in the first few minutes of the show is treated as a serious and explainable phenomenon in the book and Chinese adaptation of the book. The main character does a lot of different experiments to determine how real the countdown is and what kind of limitations it has. For those that have read the book, you'll be sorry to hear that all of the camera experiments have been removed from the show. The main character just randomly sees a countdown at a karaoke bar (no, I'm not kidding!)I don't understand how any of the 10 star reviews can honestly say this is even a remotely accurate representation of the source material. This is yet another show that underestimates the intelligence of the viewers to such a degree that the essence of what makes the novel interesting is totally lost."	almost science book miss science fiction adaptation example countdown introduce first minute show treat serious explainable phenomenon book chinese adaptation book main character lot different experiment determine real countdown kind limitation read book sorry hear camera experiment remove show main character randomly see countdown karaoke bar kid understand star review honestly say even remotely accurate representation source material yet another show underestimate intelligence viewer degree essence make novel interest totally lose

0	I have never played the games, but I heard a lot of raving about how great this series was so figured it was worth a shot.There were some okay scenes, but throughout the opening episode we are bashed over the head with far too much awful music that distracts from what could have been more entertaining.It never really gripped my attention, despite a few nice ideas. But the main issue I had was the lack of clarity behind what was going on. Of course, there was nuclear fallout, but why were some living in bunkers and others in the outside world? Why was one from the bunker so confident to venture outside when it had already been stated that it wouldn't be safe for at least another generation. I reached the point where I just didn't care enough about any of the characters to carry on watching any further episodes.Maybe fans of the games can see more than I did, but I can't be bothered carrying on with this series.	never play game hear lot rave great series figure worth shoot okay scene throughout open episode bash head far much awful music distract could entertain never really grip attention despite nice idea main issue lack clarity behind go course nuclear fallout live bunker other outside world one bunker confident venture outside already state safe least another generation reach point care enough character carry watch episode maybe fan game see bother carry series

2	I know it's far too early to say this, but based off the first two episodes alone this seems like an absolute hit.The dialogue is captivating, the acting phenomenal so far (Hiroyuki Sanada is an instant crowd fave), and the characters are quite interesting. I appreciate that the characters have been presented as morally gray, and that they don't insult the viewers intelligence by spelling out obvious character details like Blackthornes need to adapt to this new culture to survive in this world, or the many intricate political plots driving the show forward. Any point of confusion is cleared out tastefully within the dialogue and it's easy to follow.I have not yet read the book, nor am I an expert on this period of Japanese history, but from what I do know, it seems fairly historically accurate in its portrayal of costumes, Japanese philosophy, and the intricacies in political rivalries. In the case that you are not aware of the historical context, the show even released a mini documentary episode a week prior to the first episodes which contained all the relevant background you might need to understand the show. This is something I very much appreciate because I like to dig deeper into the history or lore of every show or movie that I like, it makes the entire experience much more immersive.I don't understand the criticism it's been getting on the basis of being mostly in Japanese... considering it is set in Japan pre globalization I thought that would be a given. It would actually be unrealistic for characters to BE speaking in english, but I digress. I get that reading subtitles is not everyone's cup of tea but i'd much rather do that than have badly dubbed or unrealistic dialogue which would break the immersion for me.I'm a little apprehensive about the pacing for the rest of the show, although it was perfectly fine for the first two episodes. This is simply because i'm not entirely sure how they'll manage to fit all the details in just another 8 episodes. I really hope they finish on a satisfying note, or with enough of an open ending to actually justify a second season.This definitely wasn't on my radar for the year, I hadn't even heard of the show until it dropped yesterday but since then i've already purchased the book so i can read it when i'm done watching this. It really is just that incredible.If you're a fan of historical drama, or liked shows such as Black Sails and Blue eyed Samurai, this is for you. I highly recommend this show, and i'll be seated for the rest of it to see how it plays out. If the quality remains consistent to the first two episodes, it has the potential to be the best show of the year.	know far early say base first two episode alone seem like absolute hit dialogue captivate act phenomenal far hiroyuki sanada instant crowd fave character quite interest appreciate character present morally gray insult viewer intelligence spell obvious character detail like blackthorne need adapt new culture survive world many intricate political plot drive show forward point confusion clear tastefully within dialogue easy follow yet read book expert period japanese history know seem fairly historically accurate portrayal costume japanese philosophy intricacie political rivalry case aware historical context show even release mini documentary episode week prior first episode contain relevant background might need understand show something much appreciate like dig deep history lore every show movie like make entire experience much immersive understand criticism get basis mostly japanese consider set japan pre globalization think would give would actually unrealistic character speak english digress get read subtitle everyone cup tea much rather badly dub unrealistic dialogue would break immersion little apprehensive pace rest show although perfectly fine first two episode simply entirely sure manage fit detail another episode really hope finish satisfy note enough open end actually justify second season definitely radar year even hear show drop yesterday since already purchase book read do watch really incredible fan historical drama like show black sail blue eye samurai highly recommend show seat rest see play quality remain consistent first two episode potential good show year
0	Old Fallout fans finally get a return to the West Coast, and I wish we hadn't asked for it.If you are a fan of the original Fallout games, you'll remember the town of Shady Sands. That got nuked. Which perfectly sums up how Bethesda feels about anything that came before 3.The writers call themselves fans, but there are multiple examples of them ignoring established lore. Ghoulifcation does not work the way it is represented in the show. They changed how power armors propulsion works, which having them jet up from the arms exclusively makes literally 0 sense, even ignoring the fact that in itself ignores previously established lore.The story revolves around a Vault dweller going after a family member that left the vault. I find it ironic that the main story beat is one of the things they decided to actually keep consistent with the games seeing as everyone is exhausted with that.Also, the macguffin for this one is a magical device that will bring power and clean water to the wasteland. Sound familiar?They set up going to New Vegas in season 2 which is just horrible. Going there canonizes one of the endings depending on which factions are present, but we all know Todd hates New Vegas so i can't say I'm surprised.I will say it's deserving of the 1 star because at least the costume design was great. However I can honestly say, you'd have gotten a better representation of Fallout by playing 76 at launch.	old fallout fan finally get return west coast wish ask fan original fallout game remember town shady sand get nuke perfectly sum bethesda feel anything come writer call fan multiple example ignore establish lore ghoulifcation work way represent show change power armor propulsion work jet arm exclusively make literally sense even ignore fact ignore previously establish lore story revolve around vault dweller go family member leave vault find ironic main story beat one thing decide actually keep consistent game see everyone exhaust also macguffin one magical device bring power clean water wasteland sound familiar set go new vegas season horrible go canonize one end depend faction present know todd hat new vegas say surprise say deserve star least costume design great however honestly say get well representation fallout play launch
1	"We all prepared for the worst and it didn't come.Fallout TV show was kinda good.They've nailed the aestethic, went a bit overboard with the music and had interesting characters. They respected the games pretty much to a letter.Walton Goggins is great, as always, but I think Ella Purnell was the best one here. While the characters were interesting, I wished they were a bit ""more"" of everything.B plot inside the Vault 33 is also solid but they did took their sweet damn time revealing it. Main plot is interesting and in tune with the games.Biggest flaw is, however, that they just could not decide if this was a comedy or a serious drama, then blending it both in a way that made it neither. Is it funny? Yeah, but kinda not really. Is it very serious? Yeah, it tries to be but it's just not working sometimes.It should have been a straight up comedy with serious elements here and there. But, nothing that can't be fixed in Season 2.However, I'm pretty sure Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy duo as producers are mostly responsible for tone consistency problems. Like their previous potential TV hits - Westworld and Peripheral, this can be driven into the ground like those shows as well. Most notably - Westworld, that started great and it went nowhere in the worst ways imaginable to the point that most people that stuck to the cancellation probably hate watched it.Hope they see the error of their ways or the big wigs above decide to can them and get some new people, better suited for the job.You should check this out."	prepare worst come fallout tv show kinda good nail aestethic go bite overboard music interest character respect game pretty much letter walton goggin great always think ella purnell well one character interest wish bite everything b plot inside vault also solid take sweet damn time reveal main plot interest tune game big flaw however could decide comedy serious drama blend way make neither funny yeah kinda really serious yeah try work sometimes straight comedy serious element nothing fix season however pretty sure jonathan nolan lisa joy duo producer mostly responsible tone consistency problem like previous potential tv hit westworld peripheral drive grind like show well notably westworld start great go nowhere bad way imaginable point people stick cancellation probably hate watch hope see error way big wig decide get new people well suit job check
1	Fallout is an adaptation of the eponymous gaming series which I am a fan of. It is overall a decent series but with some caveats. If you are not familiar with the setting you will feel lost, I saw it with my girlfriend and she had some issues following everything. Because, things aren't explained very well, it almost feels as if they expect the viewers to be familiar with the setting.The series biggest issue is the pacing, some of the middle episodes drag on a bit and it feels like barely anything happened. The ending is excellent with twists that somewhat redeems the rest of the series. Barely anything is revealed along the middle episodes and they have instead crammed everything on the final episode. I feel it would have been better if they had sprinkled some of these reveals and surprises in between the other episodes.I definitely recommend the series, but don't go in expecting an amazing one, you will definitely have a good time though. Expect to also be a bit confused during the series and expect to feel lost until the ending which will explain everything. A good series that could have been excellent 7/10.	fallout adaptation eponymous game series fan overall decent series caveat familiar set feel lose see girlfriend issue follow everything thing explain well almost feel expect viewer familiar set series big issue pace middle episode drag bite feel like barely anything happen end excellent twist somewhat redeem rest series barely anything reveal along middle episode instead cram everything final episode feel would well sprinkle reveal surprise episode definitely recommend series go expect amaze one definitely good time though expect also bite confuse series expect feel lose end explain everything good series could excellent
2	The music this last season sounds like bending metal drums and cats being tortured, and it's so loud that I have to strain to hear what they are saying. Look, I get that they thought making the music more edgy (or whatever that pure trash is supposed to be) might make it more exciting but that only works if the music is (1) listenable, and (2) not competing with what's going on. On half of the action scene we just mute it because it's so grating. Does not make it more intense. Just makes it annoying. A ton of the music is just very very very poorly chosen.	music last season sound like bend metal drum cat torture loud strain hear say look get think make music edgy whatever pure trash suppose might make excite work music listenable compete go half action scene mute grate make intense make annoy ton music poorly choose
0	"Brought to you by the very same people who couldn't end GoT properly, comes another strange adaptation of cult-classic books.For the record, no, Netflix did NOT in fact, 'do a 180' by showing the Cultural Revolution (which killed not one lone university professor, but instead saw 1.5 million people beaten to death or tortured to death in camps just because they were deemed academic bourgeois). The books in the first page are far more graphic and call a spade a spade: men and women have their head blown off by teenage bullies because ""Marxism"". But of course Netflix would never use the ""M"" word.Anyways after that little incursion in China, Netflix of course spends the other 9 episodes re-gendering every character (all strong characters are female, males are litteral doormats, one of them having qualms about complaining about getting friendzoned as he .. dies of cancer). In the book, everyone is Chinese, here, evidently, that cannot be - so you have one Indian, one Black (who smokes weed and drops acide while working a particle accelerator), one White (who is reckless loser , fat and stupid, and gets offed in episode 3 of course).And evidently, there's political commentary everywhere, which flies in the face of what the book was about. Heck, even ""Logic"" (the name of the ONE character in the books that considers betraying his people), has been transformed into an always-oppressed Latina woman who hapens to be a model and hates capitalism. She calls people 'fascists' when they take strong action and complains a lot about 'the men, the men'. . Oh and there's of course gay couples for no other reason that having gay couples.It's a joke, like everything netflix does. Don't be fooled and read the books instead."	bring people end get properly come another strange adaptation cult classic book record netflix fact show cultural revolution kill one lone university professor instead see million people beat death torture death camp deem academic bourgeois book first page far graphic call spade spade man woman head blow teenage bully marxism course netflix would never use word anyways little incursion china netflix course spend episode gendere every character strong character female male litteral doormat one qualm complain get friendzone die cancer book everyone chinese evidently one indian one black smoke weed drop acide work particle accelerator one white reckless loser fat stupid get off episode course evidently political commentary everywhere fly face book heck even logic name one character book consider betray people transform always oppress latina woman hapen model hat capitalism call people fascist take strong action complain lot man man oh course gay couple reason gay couple joke like everything netflix fool read book instead

I really was expecting some cool sci-fi but instead rest of show is mostly just meaningless chats and drama about guy dying of sickness.I watched 4 episodes of Chinese version and it was so much better and felt much more accurate depiction. In Netflix they even remove the main character of book and divide him into several boring characters. Like why?I honestly hope it doesn´t get season 2. One of the most boring things i have watched in a while.	read book seriously bear souless make something okay seem start good get interest first episode really expect cool sci fi instead rest show mostly meaningless chat drama guy die sickness watch episode chinese version much well feel much accurate depiction netflix even remove main character book divide several bore character like honestly hope get season one bore thing watch
2	Probably, the first TV-show for me to really hammered down the feeling of alienation. The next science-fiction after The Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and Interstellar to be the pinnacle of the decade outer space exploration. And for the comparison, 3 Body Problem might just be the most faithfully detailed, science-oriented out of the three!Utilizing the length from its long episodic formation, this Interstellar shuttle admittedly won't launch with the flashiest exhaust at first, but burn slowly as it introducing the main circle of character, and getting us warm with how cold and distance the humanity are in this. But as soon as you get through the first two episodes, the trajectory of this unknown voyage would be as clear as the mystery of the vast night sky! As it's captured your curiosity on how alienated but familiar the whole concept is. It's as complicated as a quantum science could be, but not too proud or so distant that you can't wrap your head around it.As long as you can adapt your eyes on how allergic to colors the tone is, or how muddy sometimes the visual effects are, you'll be in a slow, but scenic ride with a lot to take for, while heading towards the proper, Secret Invasion!	probably first tv show really hammer feel alienation next science fiction close encounter third kind interstellar pinnacle decade outer space exploration comparison body problem might faithfully detail science orient three utilize length long episodic formation interstellar shuttle admittedly launch flashy exhaust first burn slowly introduce main circle character get we warm cold distance humanity soon get first two episode trajectory unknown voyage would clear mystery vast night sky capture curiosity alienate familiar whole concept complicate quantum science could proud distant wrap head around long adapt eye allergic color tone muddy sometimes visual effect slow scenic ride lot take head towards proper secret invasion

0	The most underwhelming show I've seen in a long time. The beginning and first 5 episodes were great. It got me hooked pretty quickly and I binged through the whole show in two evenings. But with The Judgment Day episode it all went from a great 10/10 show to melodrama with bad writing and the plot turned in a completely different direction than was necessary.Sending a brain, our most valuable part to an alien species was apparently a great idea. And the execution? I wasn't surprised it failed. I was even glad it did.No NASA involvement, no actual scientists in the game. How did they expect Will to outsmart the aliens and somehow gather an intel for humans to later use as an advantage? Not even speaking about the fact that the sophons somehow were being used against humanity but at the same time just weren't. Why didn't they crash the plane Saul used later on? If they (the sophons) have the ability to control autonomous cars, why didn't they just turn off all power plants right away?I just hope this show gets scrapped and never picks up for another season. Just imagine the battle between San-Tchi and humans. Laughing already.I've never seen a show go from absolute peak to such a bad soap opera so quickly.	underwhelme show see long time begin first episode great get hook pretty quickly binge whole show two even judgment day episode go great show melodrama bad write plot turn completely different direction necessary send brain valuable part alien specie apparently great idea execution surprise fail even glad nasa involvement actual scientist game expect outsmart alien somehow gather intel human later use advantage even speak fact sophon somehow use humanity time crash plane saul use later sophon ability control autonomous car turn power plant right away hope show get scrap never pick another season imagine battle san tchi humans laugh already never see show go absolute peak bad soap opera quickly

That was the reason enough for me to watch.I've seen and liked The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) very much. There are few more. All based on works of Patricia Highsmith (1955)Tom Ripley is an Imposter, An expert in forgery and If needed, A killer too. In short, A Psychopath.But very charming and likeable. And that's what helps him the most.This version of Ripley is Vulnerable. He struggles, Make a mess just like anyone else in his place. Even forgets his own identity in stress. He runs from place to place and we get to see Italy like never before.Cameraman Robert Elswit who won an Oscar for There Will Be Blood, Creates the same magic here.Ripley is Delightfully dark and Constantly Creepy.A must watch.	give one star stun b w we familiar story adaption past new well starter andrew scott reason enough watch see like talente mr ripley much base work patricia highsmith tom ripley imposter expert forgery need killer short psychopath charm likeable help version ripley vulnerable struggle make mess like anyone else place even forget identity stress run place place get see italy like never cameraman robert elswit oscar blood create magic ripley delightfully dark constantly creepy must watch
2	"For those upset that actual Portuguese isn't being spoken, you do realize that the entire show would be subtitled without turning Portuguese into English? Aside from when the main character is talking to himself it would be Subtitled Japanese and subtitled Portuguese and the show would not get nearly the same viewership and then sadly canceled. Having the English and Portuguese speak English helps keep the flow of each episode moving at a smooth pace.With that out of the way, great show so far, the main character is a little off with his performance from time to time but everybody else knocks it out of the park. Excited to see what the rest of the season gives us.Ps: those who ""read the book"" and are all Butthurt, just stop. Not just with this show, all adaptations. They can't do everything in the book, be happy you're getting quality content for the things you love, there are plenty of fans of other books who get terrible, poorly cast, cheap movie and television adaptions from people who have no idea what they're doing, The dark tower, Twilight, the hobbit etc. Be thankful for what you get."	upset actual portuguese speak realize entire show would subtitle without turn portuguese english aside main character talk would subtitle japanese subtitle portuguese show would get nearly viewership sadly cancel english portuguese speak english help keep flow episode move smooth pace way great show far main character little performance time time everybody else knock park excite see rest season give we ps read book butthurt stop show adaptation everything book happy get quality content thing love plenty fan book get terrible poorly cast cheap movie television adaption people idea dark tower twilight hobbit etc thankful get
0	Something that will pop out immediately after watching 30mins of first episode is how substandard character development is. If you somehow ignore and overcome that, you would be appalled with kindergarten dialogues and subpar acting as well as casting. Lead actress with her lip job looks more like a playboy model than a scientist.But what gets to you really hard is how meek and lowly scientists behave. I get it, this is Netflix quality production, which has to be alt left filled with cliches and dorky jokes so that the average westerner can enjoy this show while eating food which they got through their favorite food deliver app.Book or not, a topic like this needs deep intellect, resonance, and philosophy to realize it's importance - all of which are beyond Netflix's production values.I've moved on to the Chinese version and although I find the dialogues difficult to understand through subtitles, I do get enough substance to think and encapsulate this thought-provoking TV Show.I truly wish some other production house in North America would have picked the book for screenplay adaption. We might have actually got something which might have been even better than Tarkovisky's Stalker or Solaris.	something pop immediately watch min first episode substandard character development somehow ignore overcome would appal kindergarten dialogues subpar act well cast lead actress lip job look like playboy model scientist get really hard meek lowly scientist behave get netflix quality production alt leave fill cliche dorky joke average westerner enjoy show eat food get favorite food deliver app book topic like need deep intellect resonance philosophy realize importance beyond netflix production value move chinese version although find dialogue difficult understand subtitle get enough substance think encapsulate think provoke tv show truly wish production house north america would pick book screenplay adaption might actually get something might even well tarkovisky stalker solaris
2	Steps... glassware.... desk clerks... polizi inspectors... luggage... posted letters... and textures, oh those textures. Did I mention steps? These are the main characters and they appear throughout.First thing I noticed about Ripley was the black and white cinemaphotography, then the rough, old, peeling textures of Italian architecture. This 8-part series is all about ambience, with an immersive multiple-murder story layered over it. The acting was good throughout, and I especially liked that of the oh-so-suave and sophisticated Inspector Ravini, who, but for one Clouseau-like blunder which he doesn't discover until the end of this tale, almost gets his man. Yes, Ripley does indeed have talent, perhaps just not the same kind of talent as those Renaissance painters that he so admires. But definitely more talent than either Richard Greenleaf or Freddie Miles had. At least Marge could write, and because she had that talent, she may have been spared the same outcome that befell her former friends.	step glassware desk clerk polizi inspector luggage post letter texture oh texture mention step main character appear throughout first thing notice ripley black white cinemaphotography rough old peel texture italian architecture part series ambience immersive multiple murder story layer act good throughout especially like oh suave sophisticate inspector ravini one clouseau like blunder discover end tale almost get man yes ripley indeed talent perhaps kind talent renaissance painter admire definitely talent either richard greenleaf freddie mile least marge could write talent may spar outcome befall former friend

I don't know if it's the script that was written for him or what, but his performance just comes off as so...unwatchable. It's like he's trying to do a third-rate channeling of Tom Hardy (who by the way would have been fantastic in this role, in my opinion).

1	"'Grey's Anatomy' started off with a bang. Unforgettably witty lines, strong acting, and clever writing mark the first season as the show at its best. The characters are realistic and even the most shallow of the bunch eventually grow on the viewer. Patrick Dempsey in particular shines through as the charming Dr. ""McDreamy"". Notable performances are also delivered by Chandra Wilson, T.R. Knight, and Sandra Oh, although the rest of the cast generally holds their own as well. The cast does well taking us through the potentially dramatic (and highly fantasized) ups and downs of life as a medical professional.It could be argued that just as important as the humor and drama is the show's soundtrack. We're treated to a variety of largely independent artists that otherwise wouldn't find the ears of a mainstream audience. The songs are carefully selected based not only on whether or not they're good songs, but whether or not they actually fit the scenes they're in. And it shows. Poor song choices can easily ruin a scene and, luckily, 'Grey's Anatomy' has yet to do so.Unfortunately, the following seasons have not lived up to the expectations set by the first season. The second season was still good, although the show quickly began to lose its novelty about halfway through. The third season was a complete disaster, marked by poor writing choices. 'Grey's Anatomy' essentially became a younger, hipper version of 'General Hospital'. Although the acting and music remained strong, no amount of wit and charm could save the show from its own destructive, overly unrealistic writing. We can only suspend our disbelief for so long before seemingly random declarations of love and an unhealthy number of bombs and major accidents will begin to wear on us.The fourth season seems to have breathed a bit of new life into a dying series, bringing back some of the magic of the first season. However, it might not be enough to salvage the mess of the third season and the latter part of the second.Regardless, if you're looking for mindless enjoyment, you can't go wrong with 'Grey's Anatomy'."	grey anatomy start bang unforgettably witty line strong act clever write mark first season show good character realistic even shallow bunch eventually grow viewer patrick dempsey particular shin charm dr mcdreamy notable performance also deliver chandra wilson r knight sandra oh although rest cast generally hold well cast well take we potentially dramatic highly fantasize up down life medical professional could argue important humor drama show soundtrack treat variety largely independent artist otherwise find ear mainstream audience song carefully select base whether good song whether actually fit scene show poor song choice easily ruin scene luckily grey anatomy yet unfortunately follow season live expectation set first season second season still good although show quickly begin lose novelty halfway third season complete disaster mark poor write choice grey anatomy essentially become young hipper version general hospital although act music remain strong amount wit charm could save show destructive overly unrealistic write suspend disbelief long seemingly random declaration love unhealthy number bomb major accident begin wear we fourth season seem breathe bite new life die series bring back magic first season however might enough salvage mess third season latter part second regardless look mindless enjoyment go wrong grey anatomy
2	As adaptations go, this month (March 24) has been a real winner. Firstly Dune Part 2, blockbustering it's way beyond all expectation whilst maintaining the essence of the book, and now 3 Body - potentially a disaster - succeeding against the odds.To compress the concepts, relocate much of the action, and condense the character range into a dynamic, watchable and comprehensible series really is quite a feat.Numerous changes (but nothing essential) to the OG Chinese hard scifi thrills have worked; all round fine acting seamlessly merges drama and science for any casual audience to engage.Of course, book fiends will have contentions - there's a few missing things I'd like to have seen myself regards the science expo - but overall it's credit where credit's due in pulling off a startlingly fine 8 episodes that cover the first book, and leave a buzz for what's to come.I watched the 30 episode, faithful, Chinese language adaptation by Tencent last year and can recommend it as well for a more measured, detailed beat by beat telling of the first book. A good comparison for this Netflix exercise.So I sincerely hope Netflix go ahead with the rest of the trilogy because it'll be quite a challenge to translate the futuristic, epoch-spanning events into relatable episodic TV.God knows we need some quality among the streaming service dross. After this pretty scintillating start to an 'unfilmable' literal epic, I'm looking forward to Season 2 immensely. Hurry up and announce it.	adaptation go month march real winner firstly dune part blockbustere way beyond expectation whilst maintain essence book body potentially disaster succeed odd compress concept relocate much action condense character range dynamic watchable comprehensible series really quite feat numerous change nothing essential og chinese hard scifi thrill work round fine act seamlessly merge drama science casual audience engage course book fiend contention miss thing like see regard science expo overall credit credit due pull startlingly fine episode cover first book leave buzz come watch episode faithful chinese language adaptation tencent last year recommend well measure detail beat beat tell first book good comparison netflix exercise sincerely hope netflix go ahead rest trilogy quite challenge translate futuristic epoch span event relatable episodic tv god know need quality among stream service dross pretty scintillate start unfilmable literal epic look forward season immensely hurry announce
2	My thoughts from the first two episodes: This is a lavish production that's well worth seeing. But I strongly recommend reading the book and watching the original 1980 series. The casting for Father Sebastian, Father Alvito, Father Dell'Aqua and Captain Ferreira was better in the 1980 series. The current Rodrigues is well cast, but can't compare to John Rhys-Davies. Blackthorn is good but I notice his voice often sounds like Richard Burton 😊 The current version sort of glosses over the true depth of Yabu's perversion. I expect the current version will have more more time to be faithful to the novel since it is expected to over 10 hours compared to the original's 9 hours, but I wonder how many more plot changes we will see in coming episodes, e.g., the Captain General of the Erasmus didn't commit suicide, he died ashore of his illness; the tempest in which the galley taking Blackthorn to Osaka is virutally eliminated and the rescue of Rodriguez is overly simplified which is a shame since it is so central to the development of their friendship. Blackthorn's time in prison is also glossed over, again unfortunate since that is when he learns so much about the culture and language from the Friar. But, 8 more episodes to come. It will be an interesting ride :)	thought first two episode lavish production well worth see strongly recommend read book watch original series cast father sebastian father alvito father dell aqua captain ferreira well series current rodrigue well cast compare john rhys davy blackthorn good notice voice often sound like richard burton current version sort glos true depth yabu perversion expect current version time faithful novel since expect hour compare original hour wonder many plot change see come episode e g captain general erasmus commit suicide die ashore illness tempest galley take blackthorn osaka virutally eliminate rescue rodriguez overly simplify shame since central development friendship blackthorn time prison also glos unfortunate since learn much culture language friar episode come interest ride
1	"When I began watching Grey's Anatomy I was single, dating and connected with the first round of characters that the show offered its audience. We were along for the journey with these young Doctors as they began their professional careers as well as their personal struggles with friendship and love. Fourteen seasons later, Grey's Anatomy has become a completely different show as we the audience has also changed. I am now married with children and at a similar time-line as some of the current cast members. It is for this reason that I am no longer a devoted fan. Having seen every episode since its pilot, I have finally questioned why I am still tuning in every week to watch the continuing adventures of Meredith Grey and her circle of friends and fellow doctors. Simple, it is no longer the same show I began to watch 14 seasons ago. Most of the character of the original show have left if not been killed off. The hospital has been set on fire, blown up, and taken hostage multiple times. We have seen love, lost, passion, promise, joy and sadness from multiple story lines throughout its run. Grey's Anatomy has reinvented itself so many times that we have seen its central figure (Meredith Grey) change for good and bad. From the single girl, the devoted daughter, the young doctor, the passionate girl friend, the on again off again good / bad friend, the angry daughter living in her Mom' shadow, the newly-wed, young mother, widower, lost adult and now, for lack of anything else, a supporting character to the show that graces her name. For this reason and the loss of so many of its prior cast members, I have found myself question time and time again when Grey's Anatomy ""jumped the shark."" Grey's Anatomy by default has inherited the generational audience of fans from such shows as St. Elsewhere, Chicago Hope and ER. The hospital drama has a home with Grey's Anatomy. When the show began, it was a home to a young cast of young professionals that were in multiple ""sexual"" relationships as they juggled their careers and side stories. Also, the show has taken a life of its own by juggling a much more diverse cast then it set out originally. With good and bad results, the solid fact remains that the current show does not reflect anything that the original show set out to be 14 seasons ago. While the show has created a multitude of amazing stories and moments for its audience to enjoy, I have lost that love and feeling many years ago. Now, I fear that after many years of hoping, wishing and praying, the show will not return to what it once was. It has tried several times to revive its cast to showcase this but has failed. Even during its second and third wind of new medical arrivals, only a handful have made the cut to the current cast while the large majority have disappeared if not written off the show. However, I am not angry at the overall show. Grey' Anatomy has (had) produced many good characters and stories back in the day. Thank you for the good times, which were many many seasons ago. Now, audience members have to make a tough decision. With that said, the show has struggled for an identity while holding onto several different aspects for a show.

2	I love greys anatomy and it's one of my favorite shows, but please don't try to lengthen it more or you are going to ruin it. All the characters are either leaving or dying so please only make an amazing finale so everyone remember how good the first seasons were.	love grey anatomy one favorite show please try lengthen go ruin character either leave die please make amaze finale everyone remember good first season
1	"I enjoyed about the first three or four shows, after that the series degenerated into romantic tragedy which is something I didn't expect. The first part of the series really sets you up for something great, but the finale is one of the worst finales I have seen since Ragnarok.The acting was pretty good except for the actress who played ""Auggie"". I found her performance to be canned and flat at best. The other actors covered for her most of the time so it's not too much of an issue.I guess if I could sum up anything is that this is not a Science Fiction TV show. It's more a romantic drama which, towards the end, really pours on the schmaltz and sentiment.The whole ""Wallfacers"" thing is completely incomprehensible and not flushed out at all. But at that point in the show it's a lost cause anyway.I probably will not tune in to Season 2 because I really don't care what happens to the characters."	enjoy first three four show series degenerate romantic tragedy something expect first part series really set something great finale one bad finale see since ragnarok act pretty good except actress play auggie find performance can flat good actor cover time much issue guess could sum anything science fiction tv show romantic drama towards end really pour schmaltz sentiment whole wallfacer thing completely incomprehensible flush point show lose cause anyway probably tune season really care happen character
2	Well I've binged the first four episodes,and requiring sleep,so finish tomorrow, so far...The cast a few members from GOT,plus next generation actors,same script writers,so I reckon curiosity dragged viewers in.May investigate the books,one of the actors who is prominent so far was in another hard science sci-fi movie UFO Alex Sharp..... very thoughtful clever movie,low budget but gripping.Benedict Wong playing a mid character spook with his homegrown Lancashire drawl Liam Cunningham usual salty language,lot of Anglo-Saxon expletives from most of the characters,so reminiscent of GOT flavour.I do like the 1960's historical references to the cultural revolution in China,and the effect of martial law by the military upon the general population.However whoever's in power in history,profit is always on the agenda,all the human aspects of plagiarism,deceit, and misuse of power.An exercise in futuristic virtual game play is now in use but really an alien recruitment ploy to get earthling followers and acolytes.Episode 5 is the big reveal,hard science required to solve the riddles The Alien visitors somehow manipulate the internet,and reveal their existence to the world at large, using communication hi tech software, light years ahead of Earth There is great spectacular cgi in this episode,gruesome,and cutting edge.... They will arrive in 400 years........ News clips with our present world leaders shown ...a cheap trick.World leaders then decide to fund the science for new technology.And invest in future science and engineering But as usual the problem will be someone else's future to solve The general population are frightened into conformity The big finale ,the engineering and science fall over, borrowed heavily from1960's actual science projects ,using nuclear blast propulsion in outer space Fast space travel not quite there yetI suppose it's popular enough for a second season...?..	well binge first four episode require sleep finish tomorrow far cast member get plus next generation actor script writer reckon curiosity drag viewer may investigate book one actor prominent far another hard science sci fi movie ufo alex sharp thoughtful clever movie low budget grip benedict wong play mid character spook homegrown lancashire drawl liam cunningham usual salty language lot anglo saxon expletive character reminiscent get flavour like historical reference cultural revolution china effect martial law military upon general population however whoever power history profit always agenda human aspect plagiarism deceit misuse power exercise futuristic virtual game play use really alien recruitment ploy get earthle follower acolyte episode big reveal hard science require solve riddle alien visitor somehow manipulate internet reveal existence world large use communication hi tech software light year ahead earth great spectacular cgi episode gruesome cut edge arrive year news clip present world leader show cheap trick world leader decide fund science new technology invest future science engineer usual problem someone else future solve general population frighten conformity big finale engineer science fall borrow heavily actual science project use nuclear blast propulsion outer space fast space travel quite yeti suppose popular enough second season
0	I Fellout of my couch because i had fallen asleep in episode three. Was it because it was boring? Was it because it was insipid? Was it because it was so contrived? Was it because all the actors were bland, not only unbelievable but unrelatable? I am convinced it was of all the above.Pro: Looks bright and colorful.Cons: CG is smeared on some of the creatures and looks almost as bad as the Scorpion King movie. Too plastic and silly moving. Especially the mutated bear. It looks awful.Walton Goggings is Walton no matter the role. Whether it be in The Shield, SOA, Fallout, He is always going to be Walton.The lead is silly, annoying and unbelievableThe music is atrocious. At first it is novel and cute but by the middle of episode one the Yankovich style covers get really old really fast. The rest of the old re-hashed songs of the 40s and 50s just get mind numbingly trite.The writing in very lazy. We have to go here to see this but first have to do this and see that before we can actually do anything. Just terribly lazy.The rest of the cast is exactly what we Hollywood has been directed to feed us.... No substance or relatable traits.Easy pass on this one.	fellout couch fall asleep episode three bore insipid contrive actor bland unbelievable unrelatable convince pro look bright colorful con cg smear creature look almost bad scorpion king movie plastic silly move especially mutate bear look awful walton gogging walton matter role whether shield soa fallout always go walton lead silly annoy unbelievablethe music atrocious first novel cute middle episode one yankovich style cover get really old really fast rest old hash song get mind numbingly trite write lazy go see first see actually anything terribly lazy rest cast exactly hollywood direct fee we substance relatable trait easy pass one
2	For me, a very well constructed and conducted series.Beautiful shots and interesting (alternative to the famous Shougun from 1980) plot conducting.I would rate the whole thing 10 however there is a 'but' - the main character or rather the character created by Cosmo Jarvis.Flat acting, all emotions in 3 sets of faces, dialogues as if read from a prompter (those in English). From episode to episode it gets worse and worse because ... all the same alle the time regardless of the emotion of a scene. Too bad!I'm very sorry Mr. CJ, but unfortunately ... in the whole series he is the weakest part of the show.Nevertheless, I recommend and encourage you to watch.I, certainly longing for good acting, and I am going back to Shogun with Richard Chamberlain.	well construct conduct series beautiful shot interest alternative famous shougun plot conduct would rate whole thing however main character rather character create cosmo jarvis flat act emotion set face dialogue read prompter english episode episode get worse bad alle time regardless emotion scene bad sorry mr cj unfortunately whole series weak part show nevertheless recommend encourage watch certainly long good act go back shogun richard chamberlain

1	Only one episode out and this show teases with realistic plot line, romance from the get-go, and of Course Nathan Fillion, who in my book can do no wrong. It's refreshing to have him back in the network line-up. My only criticism so far is actor Eric Winter in the role of Training Officer Tim Bradford. His Christopher Walken alter-ego got tired within the first 25 minutes. Hope it goes away in future episodes. I have not seen his other work so don't know if he is always like this. Reminds me of how tiresome Christian Slater has always been with his channeling Jack Nicholson. But I will put up with a lot of irritation to be able to spend an hour a week with Nathan Fillion. So glad he's back!!	one episode show tease realistic plot line romance get go course nathan fillion book wrong refresh back network line criticism far actor eric winter role train officer tim bradford christopher walken alter ego get tire within first minute hope go away future episode see work know always like remind tiresome christian slater always channel jack nicholson put lot irritation able spend hour week nathan fillion glad back
1	I was interesting in seeing how a terrific screen writer.would take a terrific book and convert it into a mini series. There is obviously a huge difference between screen writing and series writing. This show does not make the transition. While Ripley and friends make deep interesting characters Steve Zallian miscast the series or rather chose to use uncharismatic performances which leads to dull show. Fillers include lots of foot action on beach to villa stairs, letter writing, sharp unnecessary camera angle and to top it black and white which takes away from contrasts of hell in a NYC hotel room and heaven in the Italian town. Zallian did a good job with IN THE NIGHT a number of years ago however that show was almost scene for scene a remake of a British show. The added foot issues that Tuturro faced did not engage us. Without a series to pace him here Zallian fails at pacing. The characters are quite morose and really not that interesting unfortunately. Sorry to see a great story go to such waste. Sorry Steve.	interest see terrific screen writer would take terrific book convert mini series obviously huge difference screen write series write show make transition ripley friend make deep interest character steve zallian miscast series rather choose use uncharismatic performance lead dull show filler include lot foot action beach villa stairs letter write sharp unnecessary camera angle top black white take away contrast hell nyc hotel room heaven italian town zallian good job night number year ago however show almost scene scene remake british show add foot issue tuturro face engage we without series pace zallian fail pace character quite morose really interest unfortunately sorry see great story go waste sorry steve
2	I am very skeptical about eastern films but this principle is soon to be altered after seeing Shogun. I believe this latest historically inspired genre brings more elating and electrifying feelings behind the screens. It starts by enjoying the captivating sound mix and background score which together ripples the film's frequency to scintilate a purposeful masterpiece. The historical essence portrayed perfectly by precise costumes and well prepared landscapes drive the desire to travel back in time. Perphaps it is the motionary Osaka that wakes the joy of wanting to belong in the past. I see this film to be well written, acted and produced to meet the needs of historical drama lovers just like myself, and I can boldly put on record here that this is the best Japanese themed movie ever made on screen. There is no hiding the fact that Shogun is a must watch piece if you call yourself a movie lover!	skeptical eastern film principle soon alter see shogun believe late historically inspire genre bring elate electrify feel behind screen start enjoy captivate sound mix background score together ripple film frequency scintilate purposeful masterpiece historical essence portray perfectly precise costume well prepare landscape drive desire travel back time perphaps motionary osaka wake joy want belong past see film well write act produce meet need historical drama lover like boldly put record good japanese theme movie ever make screen hide fact shogun must watch piece call movie lover

2	I didn't know what to make of this mini-series from the previews. It seemed underwhelming. And Robert Downey Jr. Looked all the bit of a caricature.However, realizing Park Chan-wook was involved, heavily gave me all the faith needed to fully invest. His work on the original Old Boy, Sympathy for Mr Vengence and Thirst brought Korean Cinema into its golden age, two decades ago.The Sympathizer itself has the hallmarks of a Chan-wook film. The absurd, yet believable and charming characters. The constant sense of dread and a plot that feels like it can punish someone you are starting to care for, very quickly.Excited to see where the series goes and feeling confident it's going to be good with its source material being a Pulitzer Prize winner.	know make mini series preview seem underwhelme robert downey jr look bite caricature however realize park chan wook involve heavily give faith need fully invest work original old boy sympathy mr vengence thirst bring korean cinema golden age two decade ago sympathizer hallmarks chan wook film absurd yet believable charm character constant sense dread plot feel like punish someone start care quickly excite see series go feel confident go good source material pulitzer prize winner

1	"Overhyped show. So much potential wasted here. Bad lead European cast. Sets are OK, costumes are credible, sitting in chairs or cross legged is NOT credible for Japanese during 750 AD. Japanese male cast is better. Mariko actress is OK , but better actress, script, & no modern agenda would've improved this series greatly.Some reviewers claim this is next GOT. Def NO. GOT had well known Brit actors/ actresses & unknowns in 1st ep. GOT was global hit bc it's FANTASY with dragons, magic, based on European history. Plus Old HBO had most creative producers, & diverse cast bc they FIT character & could ACT- no political agenda. GOT would never be made now.Here, the lead Englishman male does Tom Hardy ""Mad Max Fury Road"" impression at times. He's not charismatic nor believable. NO prisoner SCREAMS out temper tantrum continually at LEADER of one's captors, esp after witnessing beheadings of natives from samurai swordsmen, & how Japanese ppl act in reverence when in presence of same samurai.Here, the Japanese male lead cast is better but too much importance is placed on Mariko & esp her Catholic beliefs. All Daughters must honor their father's by unquestionable obedience - a duty that remains in modern Japan.The 1980s show was such a huge hit bc of Richard Chamberlain, good script with author's input, realism of male dominance & correct male chauvinism in Japan that also existed GLOBALLY in 750 AD. Yet, the 1980s hit show insulted every American Japanese person I knew. I read the book too- enjoyable fictional tale of Japan from white westernized male view.In real history, Japan distrusted all European missionaries / foreigners, incl Christian religion. These Europeans believed daily bathing caused lethal flue, were riddled with body lice & diseases unknown to Japanese. Europeans were kept on a guarded special island and killed if they left it without escorted permission.Here, I've seen both new released eps. It's average for THIS era. Shame lead ""Englishman"" & Catholic priest are lame. The subtitles are fast a few times & do not bother me. But knowing so much about Japan from close friends, having read bestselling book, studied Japan's history, & remembering original TV massive hit with Chamberlain, causes this series to be a disappointment bc so much potential was discarded. A good story already exists.Thus, Watchable, but not really memorable like the original series nor book."	overhype show much potential waste bad lead european cast set ok costume credible sit chair cross legge credible japanese ad japanese male cast well mariko actress ok well actress script modern agenda would improve series greatly reviewer claim next get def get well know brit actor actress unknown st ep get global hit bc fantasy dragon magic base european history plus old hbo creative producer diverse cast bc fit character could act political agenda get would never make lead englishman male tom hardy mad max fury road impression time charismatic believable prisoner scream temper tantrum continually leader one captor esp witness behead native samurai swordsmen japanese ppl act reverence presence samurai japanese male lead cast well much importance place mariko esp catholic belief daughter must honor father unquestionable obedience duty remain modern japan show huge hit bc richard chamberlain good script author input realism male dominance correct male chauvinism japan also exist globally ad yet hit show insult every american japanese person know read book enjoyable fictional tale japan white westernize male view real history japan distrust european missionary foreigner incl christian religion europeans believe daily bath cause lethal flue riddle body lice disease unknown japanese europeans keep guard special island kill leave without escort permission see new release ep average era shame lead englishman catholic priest lame subtitle fast time bother know much japan close friend read bestselle book study japan history remember original tv massive hit chamberlain cause series disappointment bc much potential discard good story already exist thus watchable really memorable like original series book

What do you expect, of course there will be (a) season(s) less exciting than when it started. Loads of material, story lines to try out, new types of characters then. You should give the writers and actors credit for still being able to keep the viewers attention to enjoy Grey's. I do, they have mine. I enjoy this show, it still makes me laugh, I look forward to see the next episode & what will happen next season. And above all, they didn't go into the negative, like ""Suits"". That's what I like. Sure, it is not always realistic when it comes to the life & work of real surgeons, but we knew that a long long time ago, but who cares. I don't think it was ever meant to be about that. Unfortunately most of the characters leaving the serie died, so they can't come back. I hope there will be some new characters next season to bring a bit of new life into this show that's been part of many peoples for many years."	sure click review date read recent review feel say something grey th move th season expect course season less excite start load material story line try new type character give writer actor credit still able keep viewer attention enjoy grey mine enjoy show still make laugh look forward see next episode happen next season go negative like suit like sure always realistic come life work real surgeon know long long time ago care think ever mean unfortunately character leave serie die come back hope new character next season bring bite new life show part many people many year
1	"I believe most changes made from the books by Cixin Liu are good ones for an adaptation like this. I do have gripes with the show. Casting choices. Mainly Eiza Gonzalez and the other scientist. I'm sorry, but Eiza is just a very unbelievable scientist. Her acting is very one dimensional... basically one emotion, anger and disappointment. At all times. Her angular and artificially sculpted face is a huge distraction for me. It's as if they decided to just ""put a young hot chick"" as the lead. It's ridiculous.I also feel the series does not feel as EPIC as it should. While reading the books, it just felt so epic and the stakes were so incredibly high. This does not feel that way, at least not yet. I believe with a little better use of exposition in the story, this could have been achieved. The books are educational, even if not on purpose. This series focuses more on the adventurous points of this tale, which is honestly are the less interesting aspects. The themes of the original story that Cixin Liu wrote are very scientific, philosophical, and complex. The Netflix series feels a bit dumbed down for a lazier audience.Still, I do find it to be somewhat entertaining. I can't help it because it's a cool story. It does feel a bit rushed though. The first season could have used 4 more episodes and brought in some things they omitted from the book to raise the stakes and make it feel more epic.If you're loving this, I'm happy for you! It's not bad. Maybe I would more if I hadn't have read the books. I highly recommend the books if you like this series, because so far I have to say they are the superior version of the story."	believe change make book cixin liu good one adaptation like grip show cast choice mainly eiza gonzalez scientist sorry eiza unbelievable scientist act one dimensional basically one emotion anger disappointment time angular artificially sculpt face huge distraction decide put young hot chick lead ridiculous also feel series feel epic read book feel epic stake incredibly high feel way least yet believe little well use exposition story could achieve book educational even purpose series focus adventurous point tale honestly less interest aspect theme original story cixin liu write scientific philosophical complex netflix series feel bite dumbe lazy audience still find somewhat entertain help cool story feel bite rush though first season could use episode bring thing omit book raise stake make feel epic love happy bad maybe would read book highly recommend book like series far say superior version story
1	Fallout is one of the best video game adaptations to exist, however, some of the acting and writing in the show takes you out of the feel of the show that it strives greatly to achieve. I felt the writing around Maximus's character was sub par compared to the rest of the show, his acting also felt very shoehorned. All this to say, the show is great and had perfect vibes one would expect from a Fallout adaptation. Ella Purnel was a huge standout and highlight of the show, her acting was great along with being the only character who felt like a real person, other than Walter Goggins most characters felt very one-dimensional and barely had a character at all, Ella Purnel and Walter Goggins made up for this however.	fallout one good video game adaptation exist however act write show take feel show strive greatly achieve feel write around maximus character sub par compare rest show act also feel shoehorn say show great perfect vibe one would expect fallout adaptation ella purnel huge standout highlight show act great along character feel like real person walter goggin character feel one dimensional barely character ella purnel walter goggin make however
2	The attention to details spread throughout from the game are greatly appreciated. The story was good, but for a fan of the game, seeing this world come to life was the real win. The world of Fallout is quirky and weird and the show captured that. This is meant to be true to that, not an adaptation to anything plausible beyond the world created in the games. For me that's a win.Memorable characters and tons of cameos tell you how beloved the franchise is. Lots of known actors are happy to play bit roles, just to be a part of this project. It's not for everyone, I'm sure, but if you liked the games and you want to see it come to life, you'll enjoy this. I know I did.	attention detail spread throughout game greatly appreciate story good fan game see world come life real win world fallout quirky weird show capture mean true adaptation anything plausible beyond world create game win memorable character ton cameo tell beloved franchise lot know actor happy play bite role part project everyone sure like game want see come life enjoy know

0	"A One-Star ReviewIn the realm of post-apocalyptic fiction, ""Fallout"" has long held a revered status, capturing the imaginations of gamers worldwide with its rich storytelling, immersive world-building, and morally complex narratives. So, when news broke of a television adaptation, anticipation ran high. However, the resulting series, while bearing the name ""Fallout,"" is a far cry from the beloved franchise it purports to represent.From the outset, ""Fallout"" fails to grasp the essence of its source material, opting instead for a shallow imitation that squanders its potential at every turn. The show's premise follows a group of survivors navigating the wasteland of a nuclear apocalypse, reminiscent of the game series' setting. However, any semblance of depth or nuance is swiftly abandoned in favor of uninspired clichés and derivative storytelling.One of the most glaring shortcomings of ""Fallout"" is its treatment of characters. Rather than crafting compelling personalities with genuine arcs and motivations, the series relies on tired stereotypes and cardboard cutouts. The protagonist, a rugged survivor with a heart of gold, embodies every tired trope of the genre without adding anything new or interesting. Supporting characters fare no better, serving as little more than plot devices to move the narrative forward without any real depth or development.Furthermore, ""Fallout"" squanders its potential for thought-provoking commentary on the human condition in the face of adversity. Instead of exploring complex themes of morality, survival, and the consequences of our actions, the series opts for cheap thrills and superficial conflict. Any attempts at social commentary feel half-hearted at best, overshadowed by the show's relentless focus on spectacle over substance.Visually, ""Fallout"" is a mixed bag, with inconsistent production values and lackluster special effects. While some scenes manage to evoke the desolate beauty of a world ravaged by nuclear war, others feel cheap and poorly executed, betraying the show's limited budget and lack of creative vision. Moreover, the decision to rely heavily on CGI for its more ambitious sequences only serves to highlight the series' technical shortcomings, resulting in jarring moments of disconnect for the audience.Narratively, ""Fallout"" suffers from pacing issues and a lack of direction, meandering aimlessly from one plot point to the next without ever building meaningful tension or momentum. Subplots are introduced and promptly abandoned, characters disappear without explanation, and the overall story arc feels disjointed and unsatisfying. By the time the season finale rolls around, it's hard to shake the feeling that ""Fallout"" has squandered its potential for a truly engaging narrative in favor of shallow spectacle and empty action.Ultimately, ""Fallout"" is a disappointment on every level, failing to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise it seeks to emulate. From its one-dimensional characters to its lackluster storytelling and subpar production values, the series falls short of even the most modest expectations. Fans of the games will find little to love here, while newcomers will likely be left scratching their heads at the hype surrounding this lackluster adaptation.In conclusion, ""Fallout"" is a prime example of how not to adapt a beloved property for the small screen. Lacking in creativity, depth, and originality, the series is a disservice to fans of the franchise and a missed opportunity for meaningful storytelling. With its derivative plot, cardboard characters, and lackluster production values, ""Fallout"" is best avoided by all but the most die-hard enthusiasts of post-apocalyptic fiction. In a crowded landscape of television offerings, this one-star disappointment is best left to fade into obscurity."	one star reviewin realm post apocalyptic fiction fallout long hold revere status capture imagination gamer worldwide rich storytelle immersive world build morally complex narrative news break television adaptation anticipation run high however result series bear name fallout far cry beloved franchise purport represent outset fallout fail grasp essence source material opt instead shallow imitation squander potential every turn show premise follow group survivor navigate wasteland nuclear apocalypse reminiscent game series set however semblance depth nuance swiftly abandon favor uninspired clich derivative storytelle one glare shortcoming fallout treatment character rather craft compel personalities genuine arc motivation series rely tire stereotype cardboard cutout protagonist rugged survivor heart gold embody every tire trope genre without add anything new interest support character fare well serve little plot device move narrative forward without real depth development furthermore fallout squander potential think provoke commentary human condition face adversity instead explore complex theme morality survival consequence action series opt cheap thrill superficial conflict attempt social commentary feel half hearted good overshadow show relentless focus spectacle substance visually fallout mix bag inconsistent production value lackluster special effect scene manage evoke desolate beauty world ravage nuclear war other feel cheap poorly execute betray show limit budget lack creative vision moreover decision rely heavily cgi ambitious sequence serve highlight series technical shortcoming result jar moment disconnect audience narratively fallout suffer pace issue lack direction meand aimlessly one plot point next without ever build meaningful tension momentum subplot introduce promptly abandon character disappear without explanation overall story arc feel disjoint unsatisfying time season finale roll around hard shake feel fallout squander potential truly engage narrative favor shallow spectacle empty action ultimately fallout disappointment every level fail capture essence beloved video game franchise seek emulate one dimensional character lackluster storytelle subpar production value series fall short even modest expectation fan game find little love newcomer likely leave scratch head hype surround lackluster adaptation conclusion fallout prime example adapt beloved property small screen lack creativity depth originality series disservice fan franchise miss opportunity meaningful storytelle derivative plot cardboard character lackluster production value fallout good avoid die hard enthusiast post apocalyptic fiction crowd landscape television offer one star disappointment good leave fade obscurity

2	Being an enormous fan of the 1999 film, I was dubious about this. However, I adore it. So slow but completely mesmerising, I can't take my eyes off it.I loved Eliot Sumner's 'Freddie Miles' who was such a contrast to the brash portrayal by Philip Seymour Hoffman (whose version I also loved) and Andrew Scott is wonderful as the almost personality free Ripley.The only slight downside for me were the portrayals of Marge and Dickie, who fell short for me of the film versions. Whilst I appreciate this is a very different take on the story, Jude Law's version of Dickie Greenleaf as a cocky, spoiled, arrogant but wholly charismatic and attractive rich boy was much better in my opinion. I'm coming round to Dakota Fanning's Marge!Beautifully shot in stunning locations, this version of the story has been done very, very well. I love it.	enormous fan film dubious however adore slow completely mesmerise take eye love eliot sumner freddie miles contrast brash portrayal philip seymour hoffman whose version also love andrew scott wonderful almost personality free ripley slight downside portrayal marge dickie fall short film version whilst appreciate different take story jude law version dickie greenleaf cocky spoil arrogant wholly charismatic attractive rich boy much well opinion come round dakota fan marge beautifully shoot stun location version story do well love

1	"TL;DR Once one of the best TV shows in history with the ending so bad that I can't recommend anyone to watch it and invest their time in it.It's hard to even go online these days and google ""Game of Thrones"" without bumping into articles or even memes about how the show declined in quality with every season. And unfortunately, it is all true.While the directors D&D had to adapt the books, this show was a piece of art. Amazing visuals, great acting, stunning soundtrack, smart dialogue, a true modern day TV wonder which leaves you in awe and makes you appreciate the whole cast and crew. After 4 seasons, when they had to come up with the original content since they ran out of books to adapt, the show started to fall off. Rushed pacing, less impressive dialogue, but the plot was still interesting and production was getting even better. Season 7 was a bit of a mess, yet still at moments enjoyable. Unfortunately it was only a taste of what was coming with season 8.Season 8 is where it all went downhill. Pacing so rushed that almost each episode could be a season of its own, all the logic previously shown, all the character developments, foreshadowing of plots, tension buildups, absolutely everything that they built for 8 years has been thrown out of the window for the sake of some visually impressive but rushed mindless spectacle, culminating in the worst and most illogical ending I ever saw in any TV show, including infamous endings of Lost and Dexter. Season 8 is the reason why I rate this 5 instead of at least 9. Season 8 is the reason why I see no point in ever rewatching this series as I sometimes do with some of my favourite shows. Season 8 is the reason I could never recommend this show to someone who hasn't watched it, because I can't tell someone to invest their time into something that ends so poorly. Season 8 should for ever go down in history as an example for young generations of directors, to show that no matter how good of a show you make, bad decisions can ruin years of hard work of everybody on that set. And those people are the ones I am the most sad about."	tl dr one good tv show history end bad recommend anyone watch invest time hard even go online day google game throne without bump article even meme show decline quality every season unfortunately true director adapt book show piece art amaze visual great act stun soundtrack smart dialogue true modern day tv wonder leave awe make appreciate whole cast crew season come original content since run book adapt show start fall rush pace less impressive dialogue plot still interest production get even well season bite mess yet still moment enjoyable unfortunately taste come season season go downhill pace rush almost episode could season logic previously show character development foreshadow plot tension buildup absolutely everything build year throw window sake visually impressive rush mindless spectacle culminate bad illogical end ever see tv show include infamous end lose dexter season reason rate instead least season reason see point ever rewatche series sometimes favourite show season reason could never recommend show someone watch tell someone invest time something end poorly season ever go history example young generation director show matter good show make bad decision ruin year hard work everybody set people one sad
1	Finally after all these years, it's over, and despite the bad taste in your mouth, you can say that this series is unique.GoT started an incredible movement that we have never seen before, millions of fans obsessed about every detail and moment in every episode, and with a good justification. The series is amazing, full of complex and intriguing characters, with extremely fantastic and iconic moments difficult to expect, a certain magical realism gives it a different flavor between all the series and plunges us into a fantasy world dark and amazing, unmatched in its level of rawness and fantastic narrative.However, the series has ended, passing through fantastic moments, I must also say that much declined, despite the effort and great emotion that caused, the end of the series, a series that for years was strengthened based on his loyal fans and narrative fantasy, has ended, and was disappointing.To make it clear, this series is worth seeing completely, despite its later failures, the first 6 seasons are absolutely incredible, its seventh season feels a little more mixed but still enjoyable ... the problem is the eighth, which was supposed to be a wonderful ending to a wonderful series, I end up being just an over-exploitation of ideas argued on the basis of ''unexpected''. They tried to give surprises to the viewers, but ended up being unpleasant surprises without sense, without logical reason or at least chained to the decisions and motivations of past characters. Even the protagonists admitted this roughly.But despite this, GoT left a big mark in the history of television, with spectacular moments and full of intricate action. Had it not been for the great disappointment of its last season, this series would be remembered as a milestone, a glorious finale to a deserving series, but this only ended up being an ''end'' and that's it. Well, a bad ending actually.Even so, enjoy it, the first seasons are pure fantasy gold, you will love every second.	finally year despite bad taste mouth say series unique get start incredible movement never see million fan obsess every detail moment every episode good justification series amaze full complex intrigue character extremely fantastic iconic moment difficult expect certain magical realism give different flavor series plunge we fantasy world dark amaze unmatched level rawness fantastic narrative however series end pass fantastic moment must also say much decline despite effort great emotion cause end series series year strengthen base loyal fan narrative fantasy end disappoint make clear series worth see completely despite later failure first season absolutely incredible seventh season feel little mix still enjoyable problem eighth suppose wonderful end wonderful series end exploitation idea argue basis unexpected try give surprise viewer end unpleasant surprise without sense without logical reason least chain decision motivation past character even protagonist admit roughly despite get leave big mark history television spectacular moment full intricate action great disappointment last season series would remember milestone glorious finale deserve series end end well bad end actually even enjoy first season pure fantasy gold love every second
2	Have played all the associated game titles, starting 30 years ago, and outright love the concept of human greed, moral dilemmas, satire, gore, etc. To my joy, the TV series is 95% true to the games, incl. Character progression, stores and NPCs, factions, companions, environments, details and soundtrack - excellent and above expectations. ...extra credits for re-creating Red Rocket.The big difference compared to the games, is that the TV series is of high production quality ...maybe Bethesda will pick up a few pointers?The TV series isn't following a specific game title but seem to somewhat mix from each, which I find perfectly fine. Similarly, flashbacks are used in a good way for story and character build-up. The pace of the story ought to leave plenty of room for additional seasons.	play associate game title start year ago outright love concept human greed moral dilemma satire gore etc joy tv series true game incl character progression store npc faction companion environment detail soundtrack excellent expectation extra credit create red rocket big difference compare game tv series high production quality maybe bethesda pick pointer tv series follow specific game title seem somewhat mix find perfectly fine similarly flashback use good way story character build pace story ought leave plenty room additional season
0	Couldn't get past the first half of the first episode. Firstly, the physics is just complete garbage, not believable at all if you have an undergrad level knowledge of sub-atomic physics (which I can only assume the original author does not).Secondly, if all the particle accelerators in the world suddenly started showing bonkers results they would absolutely not be closing any of them down. It just makes no sense - the single most significant set of scientific readings ever recorded, and they shut down the science? It would be all anyone was taking about, everywhere, because we'd all be expecting the universe to come to a catastrophic end at any moment.I don't mind a bit of poetic licence in my Sci-fi. Not everything has to be consistent with contemporary science, and not everyone has to behave as we'd expect, but this is just bad writing.	get past first half first episode firstly physics complete garbage believable undergrad level knowledge sub atomic physics assume original author secondly particle accelerator world suddenly start show bonker result would absolutely close make sense single significant set scientific read ever record shut science would anyone take everywhere expect universe come catastrophic end moment mind bite poetic licence sci fi everything consistent contemporary science everyone behave expect bad write
2	Loved the first 6 seasons, season 7 was good but i truly wish i hadn't seen the last season. Everything was rushed, most things made no sense, bad character development and it left me with a bad taste. In episode 3 of season 8 there was not enough lighting, the way the night king went down was really frustating especially after his true intentions were never shown.i miss I really hope for a miracle to happen from HBO to remake the last season. Dan and david are the real villains in this show.	love first season season good truly wish see last season everything rush thing make sense bad character development leave bad taste episode season enough light way night king go really frustate especially true intention never show miss really hope miracle happen hbo remake last season dan david real villain show

0	"Very lacklustre writing after that, just repeating storylines. Apparently people make life changing decisions on a whim, depending on who they are in ""love"" with that week.Random characters appear and disappear to fill in gaps, but with little backstory or interactions. I actually feel sorry for the actors having to read some of this dialogue, although it must be easy to learn their lines as they were from an earlier episode.The first five seasons are just ""ok"". If you are expecting something enthralling like Code Black or ER I would go and re-watch those instead. This just gets worse and worse after time."	lacklustre write repeat storyline apparently people make life change decision whim depend love week random character appear disappear fill gap little backstory interaction actually feel sorry actor read dialogue although must easy learn line early episode first five season ok expect something enthral like code black er would go watch instead get worse bad time

1	With a great book(s) behind this and already existing Chinese version, you would expect higher quality of the series.But no, few miscasts make many scenes painful to watch and completely break the immersion into the story.Eiza González playing Auggie Salazar, one of the main characters, is a terrible actress; her wooden performance can be used in D production easily, but not here. Emotional range of a plank with two possible expressions - worried and afraid, and nothing in between is difficult to place into any serious conversation. Every scene with her is painful to watch and fast forwarding turned out to be a solution for this.Another actor, Jovan Adepo, playing Saul Durand, is permanently out of place, and role of his character is not clear, although he is billed as a top actor of the series. Supposedly smartest scientist alive at 31, Saul is not more than a useles friendly buddy with a vocabulary of a middle schooler and permanent filler between the scenes. Could do without the character altogether.Series in general have great potential and story is building up permanently, it's a good sci-fi.Sorry for the rant, but casting director should have been fired.	great book behind already exist chinese version would expect high quality series miscast make many scene painful watch completely break immersion story eiza gonz lez play auggie salazar one main character terrible actress wooden performance use production easily emotional range plank two possible expression worry afraid nothing difficult place serious conversation every scene painful watch fast forward turn solution another actor jovan adepo play saul durand permanently place role character clear although bill top actor series supposedly smart scientist alive saul usele friendly buddy vocabulary middle schooler permanent filler scene could without character altogether series general great potential story build permanently good sci fi sorry rant cast director fire

0	I, like many others, started watching this with my gf. I actually loved it and continued watching it religiously even after that relationship ended.The show has gone up and down throughout the years, but it's always come around in the end... That was true up until a couple years ago. The show used to be nuanced, focusing on the story and using a soft touch to help push a moral narrative. Well that's gone.It is now so unbelievably preachy and completely lacks any sense of self awareness. I live perfectly in the middle of the political and social landscape. I always support people's personal choices yet this feels so gross and heavy handed. It's almost as if they decided to remove the fourth wall and turn it into a pulpit.No one wants to watch a fictional cable drama that constantly brings up extremely controversial political and societal topics. We used these shows to escape the current unrest, not to be preached at about it.They are treating their audience as if they are idiots, and (somehow) believe that their writing will enlightened them. It's hard to imagine how they got to this level of arrogance and grandiosity, it's truly hard to fathom.	like many other start watch gf actually love continue watch religiously even relationship end show go throughout year always come around end true couple year ago show use nuance focus story use soft touch help push moral narrative well go unbelievably preachy completely lack sense self awareness live perfectly middle political social landscape always support people personal choice yet feel gross heavy hand almost decide remove fourth wall turn pulpit one want watch fictional cable drama constantly bring extremely controversial political societal topic use show escape current unrest preach treat audience idiot somehow believe write enlighten hard imagine get level arrogance grandiosity truly hard fathom

2	I would really like to rate higher than an 8, but my biggest complaint is that they didn't do enough to bring non gamers up to speed. As a fan of the game franchise I really liked the show. My wife who's never played was totally lost.The best solution they could still do is add in a short video, maybe in the animated pip boy style that educates the viewer on the wasteland. Approach it with the concept of someone that knew nothing about the series.For the show itself, I really liked it. The cgi looks pretty good. The acting has been excellent. So far (about halfway through) the writing has been just as good as the games. I would honestly give this a 10/10 IF they could find a way to bring in viewers that know nothing about the franchise without getting them completely confused as to what's going on.	would really like rate high big complaint enough bring non gamer speed fan game franchise really like show wife never play totally lose good solution could still add short video maybe animate pip boy style educate viewer wasteland approach concept someone know nothing series show really like cgi look pretty good act excellent far halfway write good game would honestly give could find way bring viewer know nothing franchise without get completely confuse go

If this is how doctors conducted themselves on the job, they would expect to be fired &/or lose their licenses. The characters are shallow and unbelievable.

1	I have never read the source material so I have no insights on how it compares to the novel or even the other adaptation. I have tried to watch this series with a completely open mind and no expectations. With that said, I actually enjoyed the first 5 episodes of this series and would give them 7.5/10. I watched a lot of episodes in one weekend. However, the show starts to lose steam and struggle after the fifth episode.This series has had some issues from the beginning but I was willing to overlook them to see where the compelling story was headed. Some of the plot points and concepts are very interesting but the execution in showcasing them can often fall short. Sometimes scenes are great, other times there are glaring issues. The problem is that many of these issues are amplified 10x in episode 6 and beyond.After the big revelation, the episodes mostly become a melodrama about uninteresting characters. Many of them don't seem to actually care about the events that just unfolded or the main plot line. They are too busy being involved in their own personal problems rather than putting all of that aside to focus on what is most important. The main scientist friends group drama is mind numbingly boring to watch at times.Jin and Auggie can be arrogant and obnoxious. This is extremely off putting as most of their esteem seems completely unearned. These characters are not believable as accomplished scientists. There are millions of scientists and other intelligent people that apparently can't keep up with an alcoholic that never does any work or a physicist that has nothing going for her other than a boyfriend out of her league.This supposedly brilliant duo of elite scientists does their level best to show you how naive or immature they are. They make disparaging remarks against Raj and Wade while acting like moody teenagers. Raj and Wade are both intelligent, cogent and exude competence. Wade carries his scenes so well and is a pleasure to watch. Wade is clearly focused on what is important and is actually trying to win a war of survival.Meanwhile, the 2 most brilliant women are seemingly irreplaceable but can't decide if their values line up with the men enough to help save humanity from extinction. Auggie is beyond insufferable and Jin is mostly bland. Thankfully, there are some great characters and plot points to work with. I hope they trim the worst elements as they have the recipe here for a great series.	never read source material insight compare novel even adaptation try watch series completely open mind expectation say actually enjoy first episode series would give watch lot episode one weekend however show start lose steam struggle fifth episode series issue begin will overlook see compel story head plot point concept interest execution showcasing often fall short sometimes scene great time glare issue problem many issue amplify x episode beyond big revelation episode mostly become melodrama uninteresting character many seem actually care event unfold main plot line busy involve personal problem rather put aside focus important main scientist friend group drama mind numbingly bear watch time jin auggie arrogant obnoxious extremely put esteem seem completely unearned character believable accomplish scientist million scientist intelligent people apparently keep alcoholic never work physicist nothing go boyfriend league supposedly brilliant duo elite scientist level good show naive immature make disparage remark raj wade act like moody teenager raj wade intelligent cogent exude competence wade carry scene well pleasure watch wade clearly focus important actually try win war survival meanwhile brilliant woman seemingly irreplaceable decide value line man enough help save humanity extinction auggie beyond insufferable jin mostly bland thankfully great character plot point work hope trim bad element recipe great series

0	"So, I recently watched ""The Rookie"", and I have to say that it's a decent show. The production quality is good, and the cast is solid. Nathan Fillion's performance as John Nolan is particularly impressive, and the show's action scenes and suspenseful moments are well-executed.However, I did notice that the show has a lot of political messaging, especially when it comes to law enforcement. Some episodes highlight issues like police brutality and systemic racism within law enforcement, which are important issues to address. But at times, I felt like the show was too heavy-handed in its approach and lacked a balanced perspective.Additionally, some viewers have criticized the show for having an anti-police bias, which I can understand. While it's important to highlight the flaws within law enforcement, I think it's equally important to show the positive aspects of police work as well.Overall, I'd say that ""The Rookie"" is worth checking out if you enjoy police procedural dramas. However, if you're looking for a show that doesn't have a political agenda, this might not be the best choice for you."	recently watch rookie say decent show production quality good cast solid nathan fillion performance john nolan particularly impressive show action scene suspenseful moment well execute however notice show lot political message especially come law enforcement episode highlight issue like police brutality systemic racism within law enforcement important issue address time feel like show heavy hand approach lack balance perspective additionally viewer criticize show anti police bias understand important highlight flaw within law enforcement think equally important show positive aspect police work well overall say rookie worth check enjoy police procedural drama however look show political agenda might good choice
1	First, in terms of medical accuracy this show is not really relevant, but if this show is supposed to be good because of the characters, unfortunately this excuse runs flat later as it was always pretty weak.The first seasons' cast functioned okay together because each character was at least interesting, and worked by far as the best part of the show when it started. The second season was decent too, adding to the new dynamics established previously in new ways. Sadly as time goes on any new or interesting characters that capture any attention die off or leave the show for some reason.Because of the volatility of how characters get switched in and out due to actor contracts, staying invested in the show over a long period of time fails to draw me in because there's a strong chance that in a season or two they could just disappear if I liked them.Also unfortunately, the show's best characters Christina Yang, Mark Sloan, and Lexie Gray as well as many others are no longer part of the main cast. It seems only four or so characters from the original cast are still part of the show. The worst part of the show is that it really had some compelling drama in the sense that characters who'd been around since the beginning of the show were struggling, even if they were very mundane, unrealistic, tension-less, and cliche problems, but now it doesn't matter anymore because:These characters acted more like bratty teenagers instead of medical professionals as time went on, except for Doctor Webb who luckily is still around but is not enough to save the show.I'm still not fully caught up, but it seems now the writing, on top of being un-engaging and derivative of other better and more accurate medical shows like it was from the start, now has daily politics included.Overall: a failing grade, 5/10. In the beginning, the show was popcorn melodrama with some actual medicine here and there but that soon faded as it was just barely getting by by the skin of it's mediocre teeth. The soap drama was at least fun in a stupidly corny Adam West Batman way before, now it's just unending and hopeless as characters are switched in and out like an RPG depending on the season.	first term medical accuracy show really relevant show suppose good character unfortunately excuse run flat later always pretty weak first season cast function okay together character least interest work far good part show start second season decent add new dynamic establish previously new way sadly time go new interest character capture attention die leave show reason volatility character get switch due actor contract stay invest show long period time fail draw strong chance season two could disappear like also unfortunately show good character christina yang mark sloan lexie gray well many other long part main cast seem four character original cast still part show bad part show really compel drama sense character around since begin show struggle even mundane unrealistic tension less cliche problem matter anymore character act like bratty teenager instead medical professional time go except doctor webb luckily still around enough save show still fully catch seem write top un engage derivative well accurate medical show like start daily politic include overall fail grade begin show popcorn melodrama actual medicine soon fade barely get skin mediocre tooth soap drama least fun stupidly corny adam west batman way unende hopeless character switch like rpg depend season

I guess it ended okay, the chick went to jail again & he didn't have to deal with her again which is good.

1	I'm a big fan of all the Patricia Highsmith's Ripley books and own all of them. Also, The Talented Mr. Ripley is still one of my favorite movies.So imagine my glee when I found this series on Netflix. Couldn't wait to see this new series but so far I'm disappointed. I don't mind it being shot in black and white. I don't mind the series starting in 1961 when the early Tom Ridley took place starting in early- mid 50's.It's borderline ridiculous to have an actor who's easily in his late.40's playing a 20 something Tom. Still,Both the book and original movie are wonderful! . This series so far is just meh.	big fan patricia highsmith ripley book also talente mr ripley still one favorite movie imagine glee find series netflix wait see new series far disappoint mind shoot black white mind series start early tom ridley take place start early mid borderline ridiculous actor easily late play something tom still book original movie wonderful series far meh
1	"While I don't believe this series ever quite reached the heights of certain other medical dramas, its first several seasons were genuinely compelling and contained some truly heartfelt moments. Many of its characters and their respective storylines were enjoyable to watch, even if the writing left something to be desired on occasion. It was originally worthy of 7/10.Viewers should be aware, however, that this show rarely depicts medical proceedures accurately, and emphasis skews keenly toward the drama. For most of us, this was forgivable, at least until the majority of our favourite characters were either killed off or dismissed. Many of these instances could have been handled better. Nonetheless, I persisted.Then, characters and plotlines began to lean so far left they were practically having a stroke. Undertones were always there, but I took them merely as portrating different lifestyles, as there was enough sanity to keep things in perspective. Unfortunately, the balance shifted over time, until I was left either sighing or cringing at every episode.I bowed out at, ""Check your white privilege."""	believe series ever quite reach height certain medical drama first several season genuinely compel contain truly heartfelt moment many character respective storyline enjoyable watch even write leave something desire occasion originally worthy viewer aware however show rarely depict medical proceedure accurately emphasis skew keenly toward drama we forgivable least majority favourite character either kill dismiss many instance could handle well nonetheless persist character plotline begin lean far leave practically stroke undertone always take merely portrate different lifestyle enough sanity keep thing perspective unfortunately balance shift time leave either sigh cringe every episode bow check white privilege
1	I never played the game before but the first few episodes are a bit corny. I guess that's the point to make it seem like everything was all peaches and cream in the vault while real life was happening on the surface. Lucy is annoying and is green to everything lol which is expected since she has had a shelter life. Her life kind of reminds me of religion and Lucy is the preachers daughter. I'm a big fan of the ghoul for surviving this long and he's a bad ass gun slinger. Now the iron brotherhood with the foolishness of having a squire running and carrying weapons for a heavily armored knight is just asinine. This part just rubs me the wrong way actually but that's my takeaway from the first 3 episodes.	never play game first episode bite corny guess point make seem like everything peach cream vault real life happen surface lucy annoy green everything lol expect since shelter life life kind remind religion lucy preacher daughter big fan ghoul survive long bad ass gun slinger iron brotherhood foolishness squire run carry weapon heavily armor knight asinine part rub wrong way actually takeaway first episode
1	I have played most of the fallout games and really like the series. When I first heard about this I wasn't too sure how to feel about it. The film industry is famous for not keeping true to the source material or inserting their own agenda into the films.With that being said, I found the show to be better than expected but there are some areas I found lacking.Quality on production is great. However, there are several scenes throught the season where the film locations look just like other locations in different episodes. Also, many of the scenes make the wasteland feel small in comparison to the open world game.I also felt like the dialogue was weak in areas. Another annoyance was seeing characters both background and main characters both make terrible choices. Choices that are so bad they would have to intentionally make the bad choice because doing anything else would have been better. I dont want to give any spoilers but you will notice when you watch if you havent alreadyIt seems like several scenes that occurred only did so to drive story which didnt feel needed as the story was simple and straight forwardOverall if your a fan of the series or post apocalyptic genre fan or just looking for something light you may get enjoyment out of it. If your looking for a series more engaging with a better script and sensibility then you may want to look elsewhere.	play fallout game really like series first hear sure feel film industry famous keep true source material insert agenda film say find show well expect area find lack quality production great however several scene throught season film location look like location different episode also many scene make wasteland feel small comparison open world game also feel like dialogue weak area another annoyance see character background main character make terrible choice choice bad would intentionally make bad choice anything else would well do not want give spoiler notice watch have not alreadyit seem like several scene occur drive story do not feel need story simple straight forwardoverall fan series post apocalyptic genre fan look something light may get enjoyment look series engage well script sensibility may want look elsewhere
2	What a stylish series. I just loved the use of classic noir styled direction in black & white filmography. It was edge-of-my-seat thrills but set at a very moderate pace. This is such a clever reincarnation of Mr Tom Ripley and beautifully acted by the very talented Andrew Scott, a brilliant choice. Every character in this series was wonderfully drawn, even the minor players were carefully placed - including the animals! The use of artwork and art references throughout just added so many layers to the storyline. In this time of instant gratification and rushing to the end - I found this so satisfying and refreshing. I'm a big fan of this series. Bellissimo.	stylish series love use classic noir style direction black white filmography edge seat thrill set moderate pace clever reincarnation mr tom ripley beautifully act talented andrew scott brilliant choice every character series wonderfully draw even minor player carefully place include animal use artwork art reference throughout add many layer storyline time instant gratification rush end find satisfy refresh big fan series bellissimo
0	For those who have read the book, the movie should be extraordinarily stupid. The action is largely respected, the characters do not respect the book's pattern. None of the characters respects the original description. Compared to the book, the movie is dull and boring. Compared to the 1980 screening, the present film seems lacking in vision, creating the impression of a low-budget film. The musket regiment was transformed into a cannon regiment. The weather in the film is always gloomy, even snow appears in some sequences, unlike the book where the weather is presented as clear and warm.The scene of the earthquake seems to be from another story. In the book died 140 samurai, in the film several thousand dead samurai are mentioned.The relationship between Anjin-san and Mariko-san is dry and lacking in involvement, unlike the original. The actor who plays Anjin-san doesn't even think he's read the book. The lines are dry and soulless. It seems that the screenwriter himself is included in the category of those who would not have read the book, the lines and sequences being represented as if he had heard the story from someone else and tried to improvise.	read book movie extraordinarily stupid action largely respect character respect book pattern none character respect original description compare book movie dull bore compare screen present film seem lack vision create impression low budget film musket regiment transform cannon regiment weather film always gloomy even snow appear sequence unlike book weather present clear warm scene earthquake seem another story book die samurai film several thousand dead samurai mention relationship anjin san mariko san dry lack involvement unlike original actor play anjin san even think read book line dry soulless seem screenwriter include category would read book line sequence represent hear story someone else try improvise
0	I wanted to like this show because Colin Farrell is an excellent actor and I love detective/noir films. Ferrel is good in this show but ALL, and I mean ALL, the other actors are terrible. There's not one supporting actor that gives a believable performance....except the dog. The dog shows a lot of appropriate emotions without over acting. I would definitely watch another show with this fabulous dog. His acting skills are comparable to Snoop from Anatomy of a Fall. They're both good boys!Back to the other supporting actors: I'm not sure if they're trying to be campy but they come off as cheesy sitcom actors from the 90s.I've seen the first two episodes but I'm not sure I'll watch the 3rd once it's released.	want like show colin farrell excellent actor love detective noir film ferrel good show mean actor terrible one support actor give believable performance except dog dog show lot appropriate emotion without act would definitely watch another show fabulous dog act skill comparable snoop anatomy fall good boy back support actor sure try campy come cheesy sitcom actor see first two episode sure watch rd release

It sure looks like a mid-life crisis.They are very good at creating annoying characters and leaving story lines mid way though. I went through most of the episodes to see if it gets any better. Not every story is as bad, but most of them are trash. According to them it only takes one ""lucky"", un-experienced, impulsive cop to solve all the cases. I think Nathan made it even harder to like it.I am not sure why it has this much good reviews.

Well developed characters, with depth and personality, excellent story/suspense/drama balance and great photography and cinematic effects. An excellent and diverse cast adds even more quality to the series. I highly recommend to anyone who loves sci-fi to watch this series with an open mind and be prepared to be surprised. It's not the classic flying ships and laser fights sci-fi series, it's something much better than that. Can't wait to see Season 2.	never read book mean watch series without bias say far good sci fi series see looong time well develop character depth personality excellent story suspense drama balance great photography cinematic effect excellent diverse cast add even quality series highly recommend anyone love sci fi watch series open mind prepare surprise classic fly ship laser fight sci fi series something much well wait see season
2	For some reason , I have never been a big fan of your lead actor . I can only put it down to his role in Sherlock , where , I now have to confess , I thought he was misscast and also too young to portray Sherlocks Arch Enemy but there is no doubt that he has remarkable presence . I wasn't terribly interested in yet another TV studio lacking any originality ripping of Movies ( as an Oldie ) but I have to confess that this is up there with the occasional unexpected gem in a field of dearth. At first I thought the black and white was being somewhat pretentious , given the genre has become somewhat over used ... but the CINEMATOGRAPHY was exquisite and worthy of any awards anywhere .

1	Despite its aesthetic allure, the series fails to captivate, leaving me yawning and on the brink of sleep through the initial trio of episodes. The addition of more female characters, a boost in action sequences, and a decrease in the prominence of fighting would undeniably enrich the viewing journey. I doubt I'll continue watching as the risk of nodding off looms large.While I understand it's an adaptation of a book, I fondly recall the 80s version, which managed to keep me engaged throughout. Thus, it seems entirely feasible for this adaptation to achieve a similar feat without missing out.	despite aesthetic allure series fail captivate leave yawn brink sleep initial trio episode addition female character boost action sequence decrease prominence fight would undeniably enrich view journey doubt continue watch risk nod loom large understand adaptation book fondly recall version manage keep engage throughout thus seem entirely feasible adaptation achieve similar feat without miss

0	"What's the deal with Grey's Anatomy? Why are the surgical ""interns"" not surgical ""residents"" after three years of training? Is this some kind of nightmare time-space loop that they're trapped in where they have to be subservient interns for the rest of their lives? Oh, and why is Dr. Bailey, the senior resident, not an attending already?Furthermore, why does this great Seattle hospital only have one neurosurgeon, one cardiothoracic surgeon, one OB/Gyn (who is somehow under the surgery department, not in her own department), one plastic surgeon (after being without any for the first two seasons), and, uh, that's about it. There are no internists, no oncologists, no gastroenterologists, no cardiologists, no psychiatrists, no pediatricians, etc....I think they're trying to freeze the soap opera element in time, to keep the show running as long as possible. Ridiculous. They should follow ""ER's"" lead and just let the interns/ resident's move through the program as they gradually introduce new cast members and get rid of old ones. The lack of realism in this show, plus everyone screwing everyone else, makes it more like ""General Hospital"" and less like ""ER"", ""House"" or even ""Scrubs.""

0	"I stayed up late last night to finish the Netflix adaptation of The Three-Body Problem. The writers straightened out some minor plot bugs from the original novel, and the visuals were done well, but it still gave me a feeling of being as flat as cardboard.I thought about why, and suddenly realized that in the original novel there were many seemingly scattered plots that actually revolved around the singular event of the First Contact and its impact on people. Things like the motivations behind the Red Bank base, the betrayal of Bai Mulin, Yang Weining's death, the life in the northeastern village, the chant ""Buddha bless the Lord"", the different factions in ETO, etc. But this adaptation cut out all of those elements and added some cheap emotional subplots instead, making the first contact feel like meh, which completely defuses the power the original book."	stay late last night finish netflix adaptation three body problem writer straighten minor plot bug original novel visual do well still give feel flat cardboard think suddenly realize original novel many seemingly scatter plot actually revolve around singular event first contact impact people thing like motivation behind red bank base betrayal bai mulin yang weining death life northeastern village chant buddha bless lord different faction eto etc adaptation cut element add cheap emotional subplot instead make first contact feel like meh completely defuse power original book

1	First of all, I haven't read the books, so my review will be about what I watched.That being said, the show tells us a story about humanity, how we interact, what we feel, the good, the bad, and how that can make us unique.I think the plot is amazing, there's no doubt about it, the effort to create an atmosphere of intrigue is notable, it catches you, I had no idea what was happening the first episodes and I think that was crucial, I loved that. However, when things start to make sense and It leaves you nothing to imagine it is weird, I dont know, what I love the most of a fiction sometimes is how nothing is clear, here they tell you everything, literally.Secondly, I think there were a lot of protagonists, they werent so bad, but too many stories that didnt have much to do with the plot (stop making fat people the funny ones)All in all, it was fun, it starts very good, then its not so good, then again good and then desapointing. If you love sci-fi, highly recommended, if not, watch something else.	first read book review watch say show tell we story humanity interact feel good bad make we unique think plot amaze doubt effort create atmosphere intrigue notable catch idea happen first episode think crucial love however thing start make sense leave nothing imagine weird do not know love fiction sometimes nothing clear tell everything literally secondly think lot protagonist be not bad many story do not much plot stop make fat people funny one fun start good good good desapointing love sci fi highly recommend watch something else

Acting is pretty good.However, I've been tempted to remove a star from my 7/10 rating since Jenna Dewan started as a series regular. Her Botox/plastic surgery face is so distracting!

1	Firstly, I've read the Remembrance of Earth's Past series by Liu Cixin and it one of my favourites. It's everything good Sci-fi should be.That being said, I don't mind a rewrite for a series. There are numerous fan fiction stories, one of which made it as the unofficial 4th book in the series.But what I find strange is that there are huge scenes that are following the book closely and the the others are dangerously close to trash.The main characters are not believable as top scientists. Some of it had to do with poor casting, a lot with the idiotic dialogue. These are top minds of the world and they speak like edgy 20 yos. They don't gratuitously swear.Apart from that, we also see the, now classic, strong female character trope (that replaces the man main character). That's fine, it doesn't matter, the story is much larger. But all the male characters are pathetic, useless, clumsy idiots that constantly need assistance. I whish Hollywood BS would have just stood this one out. This story not a good place for moral preaching.The CGI is sometimes amazing, sometimes cheap. The story is the same.I wish we could have had a slower story, with a smaller cast, more science and less teenage drama.	firstly read remembrance earth past series liu cixin one favourite everything good sci fi say mind rewrite series numerous fan fiction story one make unofficial th book series find strange huge scene follow book closely other dangerously close trash main character believable top scientist poor cast lot idiotic dialogue top mind world speak like edgy yos gratuitously swear apart also see classic strong female character trope replace man main character fine matter story much large male character pathetic useless clumsy idiot constantly need assistance whish hollywood bs would stand one story good place moral preach cgi sometimes amaze sometimes cheap story wish could slow story small cast science less teenage drama

After watching GOT one thing I have to say that I've not become a huge fan of it. This Series doesn't pleased me but I've to say and acknowledge that S01-S06 was a treat to its die hard fans because of the outstanding story telling, great plot and premise, Brilliant Writting and Pleasing Set Pieces but talking about the remaining two Seasons, S07 was Average with some flaws which is totally ignorable which makes all the 7 seasons worth watching this Series. But the S08 was a terrible Nightmare to the Loyal, Die hard fans of GOT because of the poor writing although Set Pieces and all the things are quite good but from the beginning of GOT it's story was it's backbone and it stood stand tall just because of it's Story. And the Writers and the Directors have totally ruined this epic series just because of a poor S08. I think HBO should Reboot it's S08 and give us a fresh S08 so that it can have a future so that GOT fans can vouch for it's next seasons maybe. I don't think that after delivering a worst S08 it has a future. I've lot to say about it but I would not get into it deeply I leave it to the Fate.	start watch series quite late want watch prequel series could understand background house dragons story link successor watch get one thing say become huge fan series please say acknowledge treat die hard fan outstanding story tell great plot premise brilliant writting please set piece talk remain two season average flaw totally ignorable make season worth watch series terrible nightmare loyal die hard fan get poor write although set piece thing quite good begin get story backbone stand stand tall story writer director totally ruin epic series poor think hbo reboot give we fresh future get fan vouch next season maybe think deliver bad future lot say would get deeply leave fate
0	Season 1 and 2 were entertaining. Although the rookies get into over the top situations in every episode, every episode there is a shootout and they outplay the detectives.The third season was only about social justice, discrimination against minorities, female power, the 'old white man' as a problem, etc.This agenda is constantly pushed down your throat.Third season is hard to watch. That's sad, because I really liked the first two seasons, even though it was always a bit over the top. But it was funny and entertaining. I think I will stop watching after season 3, because season 4 seems to be even worse.4/10, because of the first two seasons.	season entertain although rookie get top situation every episode every episode shootout outplay detective third season social justice discrimination minority female power old white man problem etc agenda constantly push throat third season hard watch sad really like first two season even though always bite top funny entertain think stop watch season season seem even bad first two season

The episode showing the ship going through the Panama Canal was excellent and so exciting. After this episode the series took a turn for the worse with grandiose plans being just too unrealistic. Having watched this long I wanted to see it through but it was all downhill from here. By the end of episode 6, I was bored by the dreary development of personal relationships. A very unsatisfactory ending resulted in my rating of 4.

2	Been looking forward to this show since first hearing of it, and with a title like The 3 Body Problem - relating to cosmology - the hook was in. So far I'm not disappointed, and thankfully no real attempt at shoehorned or overt DEI which is an instant joy killer for me. I'd say that if you're not the patient sort or not interested in science then this first episode could be a bit of a chore, however I loved everything about episode 1 and seeing some of the cast from GoT. On reflection, episode 1 was reminiscent of Sense8 - another incredible show - which also had a slow yet complicated opener. I'm about to start episode 2 and will alter my review after completing the show if necessary.	look forward show since first hear title like body problem relate cosmology hook far disappoint thankfully real attempt shoehorn overt dei instant joy killer say patient sort interest science first episode could bite chore however love everything episode see cast get reflection episode reminiscent sense another incredible show also slow yet complicate opener start episode alter review complete show necessary
0	This was such a disappointment. Main characters are off-type and too old for the roles. The Ripley actor looks like a psychopath 24/7; there's no element of charm there, so tough to buy-in that he's getting away with anything or getting anything over anybody. The scenes are brutally slow and cumbersome - which to me means they didn't have enough content for the promised episodes. I don't mind the 'artsy' way they filmed this - though it seems a shame not to share the beauty Italy has to offer by shooting this with some color. I'm a Fanning fan - but this did her zero justice. She's very robotic and nuanced to death. The character Dickie was basically portrayed as being afraid of his own shadow, - which doesn't suit the story line at all. The whole thing was a colossal fail IMO.	disappointment main character type old role ripley actor look like psychopath element charm tough buy get away anything get anything anybody scene brutally slow cumbersome mean enough content promise episode mind artsy way film though seem shame share beauty italy offer shoot color fan fan zero justice robotic nuance death character dickie basically portray afraid shadow suit story line whole thing colossal fail imo

1	I really loved this show when I first watched it. I loved the intern concept and all of the hooking up. I loved the Derek Meredith story line. I liked the rare surgeries and the competitiveness of intern program. I liked the hooking up and the comedy.I hated when season two started and they made it seem like Derek cheated but it was Addison that cheated.The series really lost it for me several seasons in when Jackson and April fought every episode about their unborn baby. It was just too much. I don't watch reality shows because of the drama and don't like when shows aren't fun anymore.I hate shows when patients die all the time and they write scripts to purposely make people cry.I don't like how they kill everyone off, just write them out so people can have closure and have good memories of the characters and people could have hope they come back.How they killed Derek off was so stupid and I think it didn't do his character justice. He got in a car accident and they should have just let him die there but they wanted to push it out for drama sake. He was the best neurosurgeon in the country. And he was brought to a hospital in the middle of nowhere where the doctor that treated him was still learning, and didn't know she was doing. They mentioned that a CT scan could have saved him. I was so upset. And then his sister comes on the show and she is also a neurosurgeon. Like seriously!?I would stop watching the and my mom would tell me the new season was good so I would try again same thing, too much bad drama. The season when Meredith is about to lose her license for insurance fraud is a big plot hole. She and the other doctors who got the settlement from when people died in the plan crash bought the hospital . She could have done the treatments pro bono instead of committing insurance fraud. And they let her keep practicing because of testimony that she is a good doctor is so far fetched. They did pro bono surgeries all the time on the show.Wish someone would write a fun show without all the sad stories of people dying. Life is hard enough. TV should be juicy and fun.	really love show first watch love intern concept hook love derek meredith story line like rare surgery competitiveness intern program like hook comedy hat season two start make seem like derek cheat addison cheat series really lose several season jackson april fight every episode unborn baby much watch reality show drama like show fun anymore hate show patient die time write script purposely make people cry like kill everyone write people closure good memory character people could hope come back kill derek stupid think character justice get car accident let die want push drama sake good neurosurgeon country bring hospital middle nowhere doctor treat still learn know mention ct scan could save upset sister come show also neurosurgeon like seriously would stop watch mom would tell new season good would try thing much bad drama season meredith lose license insurance fraud big plot hole doctor get settlement people die plan crash buy hospital could do treatment pro bono instead commit insurance fraud let keep practice testimony good doctor far fetch pro bono surgery time show wish someone would write fun show without sad story people die life hard enough tv juicy fun
0	"1. COLORS: Poor choice of colors and too many blurry out of focus misty background scenes. Even the indoor scenes were terrible. For some reason inside is a misty mess and background totally out of focus. Very unrealistic lighting and colors and very distracting.2. MUSIC: Just didn't go with the scenes. It was ........ I don't know what it was.3. SUBTITLES: Too many, too fast and too many unfamiliar names. My wife and I could not watch it together because both of us had to rewind at different times just to try and figure out what was going on. If you watch the actor's expressions you miss the subtitles and rewind, rewind, rewind.4. COMMERCIALS: I was going to join Hulu so I wouldn't have to watch commercials. Fortunately, I decided to watch it on FX first to see how I liked it. I won't be joining Hulu or for that matter I have no desire to watch another episode. Yes, too many distractions.5. ACTING: We were spoiled by Richard Chamberlain and John Rhys-Davies (actors in the 1980 much better version). Current actors don't even come close. Shame 6. STORY: I love the story, it is amazing. Unfortunately, there are too many distractions to enjoy the story.7. SCENERY: I lived and traveled all over Japan for three years. I don't know where this was filmed but for sure IT WAS NOT IN JAPAN......AT LEAST MOST OF IT. Maybe that is why a lot of the outdoor scenes were misty/hazy and out of focus.8. RATINGS: IMDB currently gives it a 9.3. It's only been out three days. Take a guess who gave it all those high ratings!

1	I was really really looking forward to seeing this NEW Shogun.It's got an amazing cast and a budget that anyone would die for but having watched this series up to episode 6 I'm maddeningly disappointed.The scenes skip from place to place making it difficult to follow the story line whereas in the original series/film the storyline was easier and made sense.I do like that there are subtitles in this series as there were none in the original BUT that was because Richard Chamberlain 'Pilot John Blackthorne' in the original series was made to learn Japanese making it closer to the original book (plus of course the author was on set helping with the script).I'm enjoying the series but anyone who's watched the original will be disappointed as I am given the writers of this series obviously haven't bothered to watch the original to see how the storyline works which is a shame.I look forward to seeing where this series goes and whether it can improve because in my mind the storyline is very difficult to follow unless you've watched the original or read the book by James Clavell written in 1975.	really really look forward see new shogun get amaze cast budget anyone would die watch series episode maddeningly disappoint scene skip place place make difficult follow story line whereas original series film storyline easier make sense like subtitle series none original richard chamberlain pilot john blackthorne original series make learn japanese make close original book plus course author set help script enjoy series anyone watch original disappoint give writer series obviously bother watch original see storyline work shame look forward see series go whether improve mind storyline difficult follow unless watch original read book jam clavell write
1	"First of all, i watched the 1st season, then i read all the books till season 2 came out and then i just watched the show since no new book (waiting for the 6th) came out.This was one of my favorite shows of all time, largely because the source material is great and this is not one of those Hollywood stories. People don't have ""plot armor"", main characters die and u get surprised when fan favorites get killed because the plot just makes more sense that way.A death is meaningful, GRRM always said that a good story has to do that. Another great aspect are fledged out characters who are not just black and white. For example Jaymie Lannister, first people think he is such a douche, but as the story progresses you see his inner motivation and that he is above all else a human being with a motivation like the rest of us (things i do for love)I was hopeful they would continue this show after the ran out of source material because some of the scenes which diverted from the book were really awesome (e.g. Arya and Tywin scenes in Harrenhal, in the books they don't meet but Arya interacts with R. Bolton at Harrenhal) - so i thought D&D could do good dialogue and some original writing.But boy ..... was i wrongI still enjoyed season 6 allthough some people already said it was showing that they ran out of book material, yes they did simplify a large chunk of the story but all in all, it was good writing and the scaling and logic of the universe still made sense aswell as the actions of the characters.But then season 7 came and they through logic out of the window, and i don't mean that in the sense that this is fantasy, but the ""logic of the universe"" was crushed. It felt like time travel and stupid decision making the whole season long. Season 8 so far turned this up a notch and made me cringe like every 5 minutes.What a sad ending for such a great start."	first watch st season read book till season come watch show since new book wait th come one favorite show time largely source material great one hollywood story people plot armor main character die u get surprise fan favorite get kill plot make sense way death meaningful grrm always say good story another great aspect fledge character black white example jaymie lannister first people think douche story progress see inner motivation else human motivation like rest we thing love hopeful would continue show run source material scene divert book really awesome e g arya tywin scenes harrenhal book meet arya interact r bolton harrenhal think could good dialogue original write boy wrongi still enjoy season allthough people already say show run book material yes simplify large chunk story good write scale logic universe still make sense aswell action character season come logic window mean sense fantasy logic universe crush feel like time travel stupid decision make whole season long season far turn notch make cringe like every minute sad end great start
1	I had no issues recommending this series to anyone. And most thanked me for introducing the series to them. But after the ending... What's the point when it's not any longer a whole story. It used to be a multilayered story that you'd get engrossed in. But after season 8... Alot of the build up meant nothing... So watching 1-7 seasons seems like a waste of time.	issue recommend series anyone thank introduce series end point long whole story use multilayere story get engross season alot build mean nothing watch season seem like waste time

1	I was cautiously anticipating this show after hearing that the showrunners of game of thrones were making a Sci Fi show based off a book/series of books and I'm pleased to say I think this show is actually very good.The acting is great across the board and has a plot that gets you hooked very quickly, even with the first few episodes being slower than the later ones. Some of my favourite parts of the show take place in China in the 60s and 70s with a particular highlight being the closing montage of episode 2.There are definitely some moments of dodgy CGI however I never found it to be too distracting or a deal breaker because of how well they execute many crazy concepts on screen, especially in episode 5.The show never goes too in depth on science that would go over most people's head's which i imagine can be a good or bad thing depending on your taste and/or knowledge of the source material in which I have none.Overall I would recommend this show to fans of Sci Fi and a good mystery. This proves that the showrunners, David and Dan, are at their best figuring out adaptations as opposed to writing their own material, thankfully the source material has been completed unlike a song of ice and fire and there is also a third showrunner on board hopefully keeping things on track. Future seasons of this show are looking promising.	cautiously anticipate show hear showrunner game throne make sci fi show base book series book please say think show actually good act great across board plot get hook quickly even first episode slow later one favourite part show take place china particular highlight close montage episode definitely moment dodgy cgi however never find distract deal breaker well execute many crazy concept screen especially episode show never go depth science would go people head imagine good bad thing depend taste knowledge source material none overall would recommend show fan sci fi good mystery prove showrunner david dan good figure adaptation oppose write material thankfully source material complete unlike song ice fire also third showrunner board hopefully keep thing track future season show look promise
2	Ripley: A new take on Ripley is rendered in monochrome giving it a sinister tinge of Noir. Largely faithful to Patricia Highsmith's creation it does however make tings clear from the outset that Tom Ripley (Andrew Scott) is no innocent abroad as we see him dragging a body down a stairs observed by a cat, Luigio, who inadvertently (?) becomes Tom's accomplice. Fade to six months earlier in New York where Tom is running low level scams, living in a tenement. He is mistaken for a friend of the absent Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) and is hired by Dickie's wealthy father to convince him to return home from Italy. Tom travels to Arani, outside of Naples where he visits Dickie, pretending to have met him previously. He enters the life of Greenleaf and his girlfriend Marge Sherwood (Dakota Fanning), both are aspiring artistes with little talent, Dickie a painter, Marge a writer, they do however possess the means to play out comfortable lifestyles. Marge is suspicious of Tom, thinking that he is a parasite, she is also jealous of his bromance with Dickie. A friend of Dickie, Freddie Miles (Eliot Sumner) also questions Ripley's motives. In the 1999 film The Talented Mr. Ripley, Tom was more motivated by wanting to fit in and his resulting violence was driven by jealousy. Here Ripley is more of a conman from the outset and while he does value Dickie's friendship he has always had his eye on Greenleaf's remittance cheques. His violence thus is more cold and calculating rather than impulsive or opportunistic. He always is prepared for violence though when there's a risk of his plans going awry. Scott is impressive as the sociopathic Ripley who is not a pathological liar, every untruth advances his agenda. Good performances from Flynn and Fanning but Sumner doesn't convince as Miles, a role in which Philip Seymour Hoffman excelled in the 1999 film. John Malkovich who played Ripley in Ripley's Game (2002) has a cameo as an art critic. The series was created, written and directed by Steven Zaillian. Eight episodes on Netflix. 9/10.	ripley new take ripley render monochrome give sinister tinge noir largely faithful patricia highsmith creation however make te clear outset tom ripley andrew scott innocent abroad see drag body stair observe cat luigio inadvertently become tom accomplice fade six month early new york tom run low level scam live tenement mistake friend absent dickie greenleaf johnny flynn hire dickie wealthy father convince return home italy tom travel arani outside naples visit dickie pretend meet previously enter life greenleaf girlfriend marge sherwood dakota fan aspire artiste little talent dickie painter marge writer however possess mean play comfortable lifestyle marge suspicious tom think parasite also jealous bromance dickie friend dickie freddie miles eliot sumner also question ripley motive film talente mr ripley tom motivate want fit result violence drive jealousy ripley conman outset value dickie friendship always eye greenleaf remittance cheque violence thus cold calculate rather impulsive opportunistic always prepare violence though risk plan go awry scott impressive sociopathic ripley pathological liar every untruth advance agenda good performances flynn fan sumner convince mile role philip seymour hoffman excel film john malkovich play ripley ripley game cameo art critic series create write direct steven zaillian eight episode netflix

Framing is annoying in most scenes.Past this the writing is unbearable, really feels like and AI adapted the book to tv or something.Why are all the main characters so annoying and surprisingly boring. They're supposed to be genuis scientists but come off as immature losers. The only interesting character with some personality aside fron being boring was killed off way too soon.Overall just a boring waste of time. Basically the usual Netflix garbage.	even finish way drag theshow also shoot infuriate manner wayyy many shot apparent reason frame annoy scene past write unbearable really feel like ai adapt book tv something main character annoy surprisingly bore suppose genuis scientist come immature loser interest character personality aside fron bore kill way soon overall bore waste time basically usual netflix garbage
1	"I really enjoyed this series. I've never played the games but I felt this was really good in establishing the world of Fallout and they made everything easy to understand. The acting across the board is really well done and the actors were all really well cast.My primary complaint about the series is two things: The first being there isn't a whole lot of character development. Our main characters Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul largely end the season on the dame footing where they began. The second being the insular characters are honestly more interesting than the main characters. The doctor is an interesting character whom we just abruptly lose. The radio DJ obsessed with string instruments is one and done. The tonic salesman/doctor ""scientist"" guy pops up and just as quickly disappears. These characters are just here to show how strange this world is, but honestly, they're so good that I found myself wanting more on them and less of the main characters."	really enjoy series never play game feel really good establish world fallout make everything easy understand act across board really well do actor really well cast primary complaint series two thing first whole lot character development main character lucy maximus ghoul largely end season dame foot begin second insular character honestly interest main character doctor interest character abruptly lose radio dj obsess string instrument one do tonic salesman doctor scientist guy pop quickly disappear character show strange world honestly good find want less main character
1	I used to watch this show around a year ago and recently came back to it since I heard there was a new season going on.These new seasons were not like what I expected, seasons 1-12 are what I believe is the golden hour of this show and they just need to stop milking it.There were plenty of parts in the show where it was a perfect time to end it but they just keep on adding unnecessary plots, interns, etc.With a show that has been going on since 2005 you'd expect the new seasons would be good since audiences keep wanting more episodes but it just keeps on repeating the same storylines since season 1. If you are planning to watch this show, basically all it consists are a big important surgery goes wrong/well, couple is introduced and either breaks up or gets married, and a big character leaves the show. It's all repetitive plots that shouldn't last 400 episodes.	use watch show around year ago recently come back since hear new season go new season like expect season believe golden hour show need stop milk plenty part show perfect time end keep add unnecessary plot intern etc show go since expect new season would good since audience keep want episode keep repeat storyline since season plan watch show basically consist big important surgery go wrong well couple introduce either break get marry big character leave show repetitive plot last episode
0	Final season would look like it was rushed, character development goes down the drain of few main characters. Somehow they stop following their own traits, for e.g Varys does everything in his hand to preserve the realm, seeing his character from past 7 season one can never think he just dies by giving hisaelf up like that. Same goes for Jaime Lannister, he was redeeming himself over the seasons and now he won't get his page in book of brothers filled with good stuff about him. Biggest disappointment was there was no background of Night King even in Season 8.	final season would look like rush character development go drain main character somehow stop follow trait e g vary everything hand preserve realm see character past season one never think die give hisaelf like go jaime lannister redeem season get page book brother fill good stuff big disappointment background night king even season
2	As an unashamed Nathan Fillion fan, I didnt hesitate to watch the first two episodes of this, while some of it is cliched, it still held my attention for the first two episodes and hopefully it will continue.Most of the characters are likeable and there is good is chemistry between some of them and a bit of drama thrown in to keep everyone interested. I loved Nathan Fillion in Castle and look forward to watching this show to see how it pans out.Hopefully it keeps to the high standard it has started with.	unashamed nathan fillion fan do not hesitate watch first two episode cliche still hold attention first two episode hopefully continue character likeable good chemistry bite drama throw keep everyone interest love nathan fillion castle look forward watch show see pan hopefully keep high standard start
1	"Spoilers ahead!I don't know about you, but I like it when a series makes sense.And here's the thing, up until ep4 I think, right before the Villain's Macguffins start being explained, the series was pretty good. Solid entertainment. Really. But then the device by which the Aliens have been proving humanity are revealed and explained, the series just couldn't hold its good senses.We're talking about 2 super Ai computers that can fold to the size of a proton, and unfolded for just one of them to cover the entire planet. They can meddle with people's maind and make them see things. They can interrupt any electronic circuit, including autonomous cars, toasters, plain, watch, cellphone. You name it. They can make us see and hear whatever they want (they also made their earthling followers build a virtual reality set that hacks directly into the brain), but for some mysterious reason, they can't know what we're thinking.And so, the plot is as follows: These aliens will be arriving in 400 years, and so their plan is to mess with all of our scientific experiments so we don't get that advanced so that when they come, they will just conquer us easy peasy. We, brave humans, finally find out about their masterfull plan, get into action, dismantle the human network they've formed over the past 30 years here on earth... and so, they reveal themselves by making appear humongous creepy eyes in the sky.But we're fighters! And so we fight. We figure a way of kind of kick some dirt into the aliens plans by building a base on the moon. We organize and all. We're awesome. But here's the thing, with such powerful aliens devices here on earth at the aliens disposal, they could easily, waaaay easily plunder us into the most deep of the dark ages until they arrive. Before we knew abouot them, it made sense for them to walk in the shadows, now that the jig is up, it makes no sense to hold back. Just fry all of our electronics. Fry every promising human's brain. Make us see and hear things until we lose our minds, and then after 400 years, when you finally arrive at earth, you'll encounter no resistance. The endAnd that's the problem with creating such a powerful Macguffin. You can't write your way out of it.

1	I stopped watching The Rookie after I finished season 3 and just decided to get to it again. From what I remember, the show was pretty serious... Especially in season 1, which was the most realistic and grounded season. Season 2 got a little out there but had more action. And season 3 tried to balance some stuff out. (This was when real-life issues bled in the show more, and they had to do a little social commentary. I honestly thought the show handled the topics well enough.) I got back to watching The Rookie partly because I just watched the first two episodes of The Rookie: Feds and that was so campy-corny-bad. And what do you know, season 4 and 5 are exactly like The Rookie: Feds. The plotlines are so outlandish! It also started to have a whole lot more romance too, like wtf. It felt like an 80s soap opera. Actually, everything about The Rookie feels 80s, except for season 3, but still. Man, I guess it's still good to watch for some people? If you like crazy and GoT.Season 1 was an 8 for me. Season 2 and 3 were a 7. The new ones stay at 6. The direction of the show is not consistent at all, plus they have notable cast members leaving every season. The show is probably gonna get worse every new season until it's just so insane, you can't even comprehend it anymore. This is literally just a soap opera for Nathan Fillion fans. Honestly, might have accidentally sold myself on this show.	stop watch rookie finish season decide get remember show pretty serious especially season realistic ground season season get little action season try balance stuff real life issue bleed show little social commentary honestly think show handle topic well enough get back watch rookie partly watch first two episode rookie feds campy corny bad know season exactly like rookie feds plotline outlandish also start whole lot romance like wtf feel like soap opera actually everything rookie feel except season still man guess still good watch people like crazy get season season new one stay direction show consistent plus notable cast member leave every season show probably go to get bad every new season insane even comprehend anymore literally soap opera nathan fillion fan honestly might accidentally sell show
1	"On the plus side, the production was top notch with nice costumes and CGI.However, the crux of this series can be summed up with that old favorite phrase from the Seinfeld TV series, ""Yadda Yadda Yadda, Blah Blah Blah"". Not only is the dialog dull, inane, and mostly pointless; it goes on forever and ever, without taking you anywhere (admittedly it is occasionally interrupted by some interesting action sequences). By the tenth episode I was glad that it had ended.Other drawbacks are:The character of Blackthorne. I don't know if it was the actor, director, or script, but this character was dull, boorish, and obnoxious (and he always had this confused, dumb look on his face). This is not something you want in a protagonist.Mariko's character was uninteresting and boring. I did not even feel sad when she met her demise; my reaction was more ""Oh well"" (shrug)."	plus side production top notch nice costume cgi however crux series sum old favorite phrase seinfeld tv series yadda yadda yadda blah blah blah dialog dull inane mostly pointless go forever ever without take anywhere admittedly occasionally interrupt interest action sequence tenth episode glad end drawback character blackthorne know actor director script character dull boorish obnoxious always confuse dumb look face something want protagonist mariko character uninteresting bore even feel sad meet demise reaction oh well shrug

The story was exactly like the spaceship for the final solution: accelerating after each episode but some wrong happens and the spaceship lost his direction to nowhere. Could be a slower storytelling with a better settlement. Will watch the 2nd season and rope that the series come back to another direction.Netflix put some of the dark palette of black mirror but I think the series need more colors, something different of the traditional formula and algorithmic of Netflix.The show runners could have more courage, trust in the story and be confident to run each episode with a lower velocity to give us time to absorb the content.

It's so bad it's shameful. Cardboard conversations, acting so dull it killed any interest I had and I forced myself to see through the edit of predictable scenes that is the first episode. If it wasnt for the sex and violence I would've thought that this was aimed at children. Fallout is cheesy and fun, this is like a sitcom with laugh track. Everything is so over explained, obvious, the cringe I get from thinking that someone put thought (barely), effort and money into this hurts me after a while of watching. Such a waste. 20 minutes of bad slow mo fight scene with cute music is not doing it for me anymore, not after seeing it for the 300th time. Nolan listed cliches in this series. And also, the main character, who did the casting? Someones intern nephew? I find it hard to believe that someone so bad at acting is the star of this show when there are so many talented people out there.	take vast imaginative world fallout take whatever billion dollar budget practically actor actress want come bad shameful cardboard conversation act dull kill interest force see edit predictable scene first episode be not sex violence would think aim child fallout cheesy fun like sitcom laugh track everything explain obvious cringe get think someone put think barely effort money hurt watch waste minute bad slow mo fight scene cute music anymore see th time nolan list cliche series also main character cast someone intern nephew find hard believe someone bad act star show many talented people
1	The real star of the show is the production design, which is spot on perfect and looks just like the game - it is what's holding the whole thing together. Walton Goggins is another stand out as the Ghoul; he is the real protagonist if you ask me. The other 2 main characters aren't really that engaging and feel more tacked on to get the plot moving, especially Maximus, who only seems to be there to justify having the Brotherhood in there at all.They try to cram so many things into these 8 episodes that it's hard to get attached to anything other than the guy who is present in nearly all of it. The writing is okay at best and veers into Marvel-esque dialogue at worst. The direction is mostly quite flat and boring, but the story picks up towards the end with a few reveals that will have an interesting effect on the next game should they remember it 15 years down the road.All in all, it's not bad but there's a lot of wasted potential. I'm still interested to see where they take it with the second season, which is bound to be greenlit.	real star show production design spot perfect look like game hold whole thing together walton goggin another stand ghoul real protagonist ask main character really engage feel tack get plot move especially maximus seem justify brotherhood try cram many thing episode hard get attach anything guy present nearly write okay good veer marvel esque dialogue bad direction mostly quite flat bore story pick towards end reveal interest effect next game remember year road bad lot waste potential still interest see take second season bind greenlit

Splitting the main character(s) of the books up into a diverse UK-ish circle of friends (with partly bad actors and partly unlikable characters) is turning the exceptional and credible story-line of the books into a cheap implausible soap opera.What remains is in the end simply riding on the massive wave of the excellent books. Anytime the producers decide to go off-track of the original story with their own ""ideas"", the show declines massively.In short: The (tragically known) producers did it again.

2	Not sure where all these 10's are coming from, Shogun is excellent television for sure, but the obvious heavy handed CGI takes me right out of the narrative a lot of time, and it's a shame. But such is big budget scifi and historical pieces these days. I don't remember seeing the previous iteration on television back in the 80's I think, but this one's got all the right ingredients, and I'm also not sure how faithful it is to the original source material. Seems like it's a blockbuster breakout hit which can only be a positive, but I'd rather see more practical sets and less CGI is all I'm saying.	sure come shogun excellent television sure obvious heavy hand cgi take right narrative lot time shame big budget scifi historical piece day remember see previous iteration television back think one get right ingredient also sure faithful original source material seem like blockbuster breakout hit positive rather see practical set less cgi say

But the show really hasn't been good since Lexi and Mark died. During these unpredictable times, I really long for the warmth and friendship of the original gang. When the characters had spunk and ambition. And even though the storylines were often dark, the writers managed to lighten the mood with personal relationships and banter. The show has now adopted some sort of moral theme. When will writers realize that what make the characters and storylines so relatable, is the imperfections. That's why network TV is failing and foreign streaming shows are taking over. I haven't watched since mid-way though the Covid season.

0	As the title said. This is the worse adaption ever. It doesn't even stay true to the source material. At no point in this series did the main character clip into the ground and fall out of the map. There was also a severe lack of Macho Man Randy Savage and Thomas the Tank Engine deathclaws in this series. How can you be authentic to Fallout without delivering the classic Bethesda jank that makes Fallout great in the first place? Bethesda's philosophy is nowhere to be seen in this entire series. When one thinks Bethesda, one thinks of a half baked unfinished product, and that is fine. You know why? Because the fans will fix it anyway. It just works.	title say bad adaption ever even stay true source material point series main character clip grind fall map also severe lack macho man randy savage thomas tank engine deathclaw series authentic fallout without deliver classic bethesda jank make fallout great first place bethesda philosophy nowhere see entire series one think bethesda one think half bake unfinished product fine know fan fix anyway work
2	This epic drama series starts out slow and unassuming, but this storyline gets more and more intense, slowly but steadily towards the riveting, visceral, intense and dramatic end. So have some patience at the start, your patience will be rewarded...The good: the actors (and characters) in this story are really impressive (unlike many other tv series) and even the supporting actors are good (which is a rarity), with great actor's chemistry between the leading actors. What incredible delight to watch!More good: this storyline is really intrigueing, although it starts out quite slow and unassuming, this story spirals into a feast of honor and survival, with the most wicked and dramatic and heroic plot turns that leaves me behind breathing for some relief...Even more good: this series looks and sounds the part. With beautiful costumes and sets and eyedropping gorgeous photography. What beauty.This is the sort of quality one only usually gets to see in masterfully made feature movie classics.Beware: you might be misled by the trailer, which shows lots of action sequences, but besides several stylish, yet quite bloody, short samourai fighting scenes, this movie is firstmost (for some 80%) an ACTOR's movie with TERRIFIC dialogues and lots of suspenseful INTRIGUES. Probably best suited for an audience who appreciates the finer period acting dramas is my (lucky) guess...One of the very few tv series that make me watch the end credits of EVERY episode till the very last credit line and the last piece of soundsore. What blissful mastery!Bravo!	epic drama series start slow unassuming storyline get intense slowly steadily towards rivet visceral intense dramatic end patience start patience reward good actor character story really impressive unlike many tv series even support actor good rarity great actor chemistry lead actor incredible delight watch good storyline really intrigue although start quite slow unassume story spiral feast honor survival wicke dramatic heroic plot turn leave behind breathe relief even good series look sound part beautiful costume set eyedroppe gorgeous photography beauty sort quality one usually get see masterfully make feature movie classic beware might mislead trailer show lot action sequence besides several stylish yet quite bloody short samourai fight scene movie firstmost actor movie terrific dialogue lot suspenseful intrigue probably good suit audience appreciate finer period act drama lucky guess one tv series make watch end credit every episode till last credit line last piece soundsore blissful mastery bravo
1	On the lookout for a proper realistic cop series, stumbled on this.Characters showed promise but as the series unfolds everything boils down to 'love', loneliness, stupidity.Unseemly conduct by hardened police officers, who Are more interested in falling in love or getting over troubled childhood or dealing with normal life issues.The prisoners are smarter, drug dealers are better at strategic planning.Women officers trying to act macho or simpering or plain juvenile.Sometimes I wonder if they churn out series without any understanding of what the audience is looking out for.Token LGBTQ characters, with weak characters are we so gullible?	lookout proper realistic cop series stumble character show promise series unfold everything boil love loneliness stupidity unseemly conduct harden police officer interest fall love get trouble childhood deal normal life issue prisoner smart drug dealer well strategic plan woman officer try act macho simper plain juvenile sometimes wonder churn series without understand audience look token lgbtq character weak character gullible

Everyone around Grey has performed well but she doesn't know how to act. Everyone is sleeping around with everyone. Many characters don't work only gossip and stupid drama. Very less medical talks. Unwanted twists and turns.Could have been much better with this star cast. Many unwanted scenarios, ghosts, forced LGBT.Many situations just dragged a bit too long.This is more personal than professional drama.Weakest link is Meridith grey.

But it does provide the viewer one thing at least - time. Time to get to know the main characters, their history and culture, time to think, time to form ideas and criticism, time to breathe.When the american production decided to ""slim it down"" to 8 (eight!!) episodes, it took away that time.What remained is reminiscent of the dessicated bodies of the Trisolarans, when chaotic times hit them.The americans try to re-hydrate the dry storyline with the only tactics they know - comic-relief characters, love interests, lively banter, commercialization, gratuitous violence. Some say they have ""dumbed it down"" for the american audience, but I believe they are just robbing those who are open to explore different types of storytelling than the ones they are force-fed every day.I enjoyed the Chinese series, despite its shortcomings.

1	"...is that TWO of the 5 Bodies can't stay awake through ""3 Body Problem"".The show has some potential, but it keeps getting way too bogged down in the personal dramas surrounding the younger characters; spending entire episodes crying on a beach or in a bar.Three saving graces are. Liam Cunningham (""Davos"" from Game of Thrones""), Rosalind Chao (""Keiko O'Brien"" from ""Star Trek!"") and. Benedict Wong (""Wong"" from the MCU). They are able to ground this series and seem to be the three characters who keep the pace moving forward. Nothing is wasted when they are on screen. Sadly, there was a 4th actor, John Bradley (another GoT alum, ""Samwell Tarly""), but they killed off his character early on.Now that, two episodes out from the season finale, the pace has slowed to a glaciers pace, we're just rolling our eyes hoping to just get through it."	two body stay awake body problem show potential keep get way bogge personal drama surround young character spend entire episode cry beach bar three save grace liam cunningham davos game throne rosalind chao keiko brien star trek benedict wong wong mcu able grind series seem three character keep pace move forward nothing waste screen sadly th actor john bradley another get alum samwell tarly kill character early two episode season finale pace slow glacier pace roll eye hop get
1	For those that have never played the game, the basic premise is that the protagonist starts in an underground fallout shelter called a vault, and through various circumstances is forced to the surface in a struggle to survive.This show gets that part right, but it's via a poorly written story that has no coherent thought process behind it. Sure, there's a general plot that is followed in each episode. Unfortunately, the writers don't seem to want to actually tell a good story, they just want to set up individual scenes that are loosely tied together... and don't even get me started on the plethora of plot holes and inconsistencies.On a positive note, the show does a good enough job of capturing the look and feel of the Fallout world. However, it does not seem to populate that world with all of the enemies and monsters that you would find in the game. It gives you a few ghouls and radroaches here and there, but the actual Fallout world is teeming with these, as well as an abundance of other nasties to be dealt with.Overall, I was very disappointed with this because, as the title says, I expected greatness and I got mediocrity.	never play game basic premise protagonist start underground fallout shelter call vault various circumstance force surface struggle survive show get part right via poorly write story coherent think process behind sure general plot follow episode unfortunately writer seem want actually tell good story want set individual scene loosely tie together even get start plethora plot hole inconsistency positive note show good enough job capture look feel fallout world however seem populate world enemy monster would find game give ghoul radroache actual fallout world teem well abundance nastie deal overall disappoint title say expect greatness get mediocrity
0	The show starts with potential, then falls off a cliff rapidly, which is subsequently sent down a long, long hill. Actors do a good job with their material, however, most come off very unlikable. The action is serviceable, however it has apparent, obvious nitpicks that you could dissect. Logic of both action and downtime feels very floaty and seems wildly inconsistent scene to scene. Dialogue is passable however seems intent on out of place comedy. Instead of a comedy, it would have serviced better as a thoughtful tale instead of trying to appeal to an out of touch funny wonderland. It's connection to the games seems to be an unfortunate attachment that forces it to an awkward compromise, though it should have been disconnected for both fans and non-fans alike so it could spread wings better. Even for non-fans, there's glaring issues with it's continuity and logic, complete with unremarkable inconsistent problems with the overall story.	show start potential fall cliff rapidly subsequently send long long hill actor good job material however come unlikable action serviceable however apparent obvious nitpick could dissect logic action downtime feel floaty seem wildly inconsistent scene scene dialogue passable however seem intent place comedy instead comedy would service well thoughtful tale instead try appeal touch funny wonderland connection game seem unfortunate attachment force awkward compromise though disconnect fan non fan alike could spread wing well even non fan glare issue continuity logic complete unremarkable inconsistent problem overall story
2	This captures so much that I expected from a Fallout show. The set design, costumes, make-up, storylines, NPC's all bring this show to life. So engaging, wonderful twists and turns, and it felt like you were behind the wheel, taking in the choices and seeing how our heroine Lucy decided to lead her path. It was incredible to watch a show that had to have been the cost of a full length cinematic film. The sheer amount of details they weaved told the story so well, but left a ton of Easter eggs for the die hard gamers to enjoy. Rock solid casting from the main characters to the one-offs. I had a blast watching it, and I cannot wait for another season.	capture much expect fallout show set design costume make storyline npc bring show life engage wonderful twist turn feel like behind wheel take choice see heroine lucy decide lead path incredible watch show cost full length cinematic film sheer amount detail weave tell story well leave ton easter egg die hard gamer enjoy rock solid cast main character one off blast watch wait another season
0	Game of Thrones used to be a show about how the petty squabbles of humanity were a threat to it's very existence. The fight for the throne has always been about personal distractions being placed over what we all know was the real danger: the white walkers. Winter came, as we were promised from the very first scene of the very first episode. And what was the point? So the Night King could die via Deus Ex Machin-Aria and we can spend the last three episodes watching the remaining characters (you know, the plot armor army) deal with a drunk pregnant lady and a generic crazy guy. The episode was pretty enough, when you could see anything. Strategy was so bad they honestly all deserved to die for how freaking disorganized everyone was. Music was the one saving grace, and Theon and Lyanna were both satisfying deaths, at least.

1	Really nails the games! The costume is spot on, in that it also embraces being over the top in that fallout/rockstar humor. It is cool seeing the games like this and the guy who plays the ghoul he is just a perfect creep and crack up. Im really sorry if he is a great person in real life cause I believe every sleazy thing this guy does.Why the meager rating? The plain Jane boring writing. No chara yer development forever. It seems they chose to make the characters just like atrociously stupid and it's honestly hard to watch. They just do the dumbest things to b le in distress constantly. I don't know why that is necessary considering that they are living in a nuclear wasteland! The story is delivered at a snails pace. We are shoveled endless gore for gores sake. I think that is a mistake. We have had few years of relentlessly realistic gore in high budget works produced by Netflix and all that apple exclusive stuff. I'm tired of it. It's overused and how distracts and detracts from the story. It once sold how extreme something was now it's like tattoos. More than half of people have them on their face and they look like a bunch of sheep following the herd. It's no longer rebellious and edgy! All those girls grew up, didn't leave the trailer, had kids and took them to get these tattoos on their 12th bday lmao. Anyways back to the review because it seems I have not made the dear and all inclusive six hundred American English characters limit! I must be mistaken right?The show is entertaining, especially, if you like the games. I couldn't finish them and this slow delivers on interesting story so slowly after it starts with a bang. Like I thought it was going to go right in and now I'm like a baby along with the girl because she is just so naive that none of these experiences are changing her? And nobody can talk, like a superhero movie all is just fists to drive the bad writing, and then some deus ex machina to further save bad writing. Everybody is very convenient in the path they wonder after the last CGI attack lol.	really nail game costume spot also embrace top fallout rockstar humor cool see game like guy play ghoul perfect creep crack I m really sorry great person real life cause believe every sleazy thing guy meager rat plain jane bore write chara yer development forever seem choose make character like atrociously stupid honestly hard watch dumb thing b le distress constantly know necessary consider live nuclear wasteland story deliver snail pace shovel endless gore gore sake think mistake year relentlessly realistic gore high budget work produce netflix apple exclusive stuff tire overuse distract detract story sell extreme something like tattoo half people face look like bunch sheep follow herd long rebellious edgy girl grow leave trailer kid take get tattoo th bday lmao anyways back review seem make dear inclusive six hundred american english character limit must mistake right show entertain especially like game finish slow deliver interest story slowly start bang like think go go right like baby along girl naive none experience change nobody talk like superhero movie fist drive bad write deus ex machina save bad write everybody convenient path wonder last cgi attack lol
0	I must be going insane because I literally cannot fathom how this show has gotten anything over 5/10 by any reputable critic.The first episode was somewhat engaging, but towards the end and pretty much everything after that began to feel like I was watching an amateur theatre youth group's attempt at a video game parody. The acting is absolutely atrocious from pretty much every character. The plot is uninteresting, the CGI is terrible and the pacing is all over the place.I really hope some people with brains start watching this so the reviews start to match its actual quality, because I wasted 2 hours of my life on this thanks to the ratings it received.As a long-time fan of the Fallout series, I'm really disappointed that they couldn't find more than one competent actor for the show.	must go insane literally fathom show get anything reputable critic first episode somewhat engage towards end pretty much everything begin feel like watch amateur theatre youth group attempt video game parody act absolutely atrocious pretty much every character plot unintereste cgi terrible pace place really hope people brain start watch review start match actual quality waste hour life thank rat receive long time fan fallout series really disappoint find one competent actor show
2	There are only two programs I won't miss on TV, and Grey's is one of them.Why? Because I watch TV to escape from the real world! Since the pilot, I've been hooked - the characters are engaging, and I find them quite true-to-life in that there are times when I love them, and times when I don't. Even George bugs me occasionally (the boy's a born doormat), and Bailey is a DIVA. The plots aren't too heavy, the acting's great, and I enjoy the soundtrack.I agree with some of the comments, especially about the title character being far too introspective and prone to fits of existential moping, but you can't have everything! I watch the show religiously because it takes me away from where I am, and I can lose myself in their lives for an hour. I cheered when Izzie FINALLY got it on with Alex, I shouted at the TV last night when George kissed Meredith -seriously, it will end in heartbreak - and the whole Burke and Cristina relationship is wonderfully played. Yes, if I was injured, I wouldn't want to go to their hospital to get fixed, they'd probably be in a cupboard having sex, but as TV it's first rate.	two program miss tv grey one watch tv escape real world since pilot hook character engage find quite true life time love time even george bug occasionally boy bear doormat bailey diva plot heavy act great enjoy soundtrack agree comment especially title character far introspective prone fit existential mop everything watch show religiously take away lose live hour cheer izzie finally get alex shout tv last night george kiss meredith seriously end heartbreak whole burke cristina relationship wonderfully play yes injure want go hospital get fix probably cupboard sex tv first rate
1	After the departure of Sandra Oh of the series, Grey's lost its quality. It's a bad series, nothing interesting happens. I love Ellen and the rest of the cast, but they must finish the show, it does not make sense anymore. 9 only for seasons 1 to 10.	departure sandra oh series grey lose quality bad series nothing interest happen love ellen rest cast must finish show make sense anymore season

Nolan is emotionally not suited to be a cop in LA, maybe in a small rural town where everybody is nice.	tv series ok mostly fiction episode dramatize particular episode nolan kill criminal self defense nolan emotionally suit cop la maybe small rural town everybody nice

1	This series has been exceptional through its first six seasons. I used to recommend the show to people that haven't watched it. Now after season 8, I steer people away from watching the show.Anyone will love the first six seasons, but it isn't worth the heartbreak you will experience after watching the final two seasons. You spend all this time talking about the show, the characters, the subplots, speculating the ending. But what you get is bad dialogues, plot holes, unsatisfactory story, an epic battle that you literally can't see, some complicated characters becoming bots, some heroes just fading into the background, some heroes turning villains unnecessarily and of course the worst possible ending.Don't believe the critics and people that say they liked the ending. What they are encouraging is mediocrity. If I have to say few things that keep the final two seasons above water, they are, the music, the production sets and the actors.Netflix executives that hired David & Dan for $250 million, really? You spent that much money on mediocrity?I don't recommend anyone watch this series because the payoff isn't worth it.	series exceptional first six season use recommend show people watch season steer people away watch show anyone love first six season worth heartbreak experience watch final two season spend time talk show character subplot speculate end get bad dialogue plot hole unsatisfactory story epic battle literally see complicate character become bot hero fade background hero turn villain unnecessarily course worst possible end believe critic people say like end encourage mediocrity say thing keep final two season water music production set actor netflix executive hire david dan million really spend much money mediocrity recommend anyone watch series payoff worth
1	"I was really looking forward to this series, being a fan of the books and the '99 film. I tried very hard while watching to not compare it to that film, and had to keep reminding myself to not do so. Almost an exercise in futility considering how superior that film is to this. Even if I hadn't ever seen the film, I'd still feel the same about this series. So I let a day go by before writing my review but I still haven't changed my opinion. This series does follow the book more closely than the last film did.Unlike what other reviews have said, I didn't mind the black and white. Other than it makes an incredibly vibrant country like Italy look drab. Even in winter, which is the season it's set in, Italy is full of life. According to the series there's only about ten people who live in whole country because you don't really see anyone other than these characters. The cinematography is beautiful and definitely the best thing about this series. But I have to think if it had been in color it might have helped this slow and downright dull series pack a little punch. It gives Italy and its gorgeous coast, cities and life the bland flavor of what a post war eastern block communist country is depicted in other films. There is also a very strong art house vein, with far too many and too long shots of stairs, alleys and streets.Dakota Fanning who I really like, and was excited to see in something new was the best in this film of the three main characters. And this was far from her best work, though the last episodes she does give a little more. She's not bad at all, but there's no emotion. She has no chemistry with the actor who plays Dickey, who in turn has no chemistry with the actor who plays Tom. The acting overall isn't bad it's just not giving much of anything. I've also seen complaints about Freddie being played by a woman or non binary (I've read both in the review and I'm not sure which is correct nomenclature for the actor, I'll just say she) but frankly she gives the best performance because she has some feeling. Not just flat affects and performance like the rest. The best scenes are with the police inspector, which have a little tension but could have really had more. The inspector is my favorite character of all of them, he at least gives some performance. They try to have a cat and mouse conflict but it just doesn't quite happen. Leaving me with no care of who dies or not and if anyone is caught or not.Dickey and Tom are supposed to have real chemistry that leads Tom to believe that Dickie has feelings for him. Tom is supposed to be a master at impersonating people to con people. None of these are believably pulled off in this or even attempted. There are even unexplained plot holes that demand you have some knowledge of the book or you'd be totally lost. That's if you even make it far because it is very slow. Slow isn't a dealbreaker for me if there's pay off and this lacks much. When a murder scene is boring then there is a problem.I can only guess that the European art house style is what they were purposefully trying to portray. The dry dialogue even in what should be emotional moments, black and white with too long shots of stairs for no reason, exaggerated ""I'm bored"" style of acting. Which doesn't help when the plot and acting is plugging along monotonously. It does pick up in the last two episodes. Sometimes a film tries too hard to be avant-gard and it just doesn't work. Had it been a 90-180 min movie it would've been better but a series needs to keep you captivated to want to watch not just to see if something happens. Anyone who rated this over a 6 has either not seen the '99 movie or trying to seem like a high brow art film buff, but they're way off. So I was disappointed, and will go watch the Talented Mr Ripely to cleanse my brain and give it the gorgeous Italian feel and burning tension it's screaming for."	really look forward series fan book film try hard watch compare film keep remind almost exercise futility consider superior film even ever see film still feel series let day go write review still change opinion series follow book closely last film unlike review say mind black white make incredibly vibrant country like italy look drab even winter season set italy full life accord series ten people live whole country really see anyone character cinematography beautiful definitely good thing series think color might help slow downright dull series pack little punch give italy gorgeous coast cities life bland flavor post war eastern block communist country depict film also strong art house vein far many long shot stairs alley street dakota fan really like excite see something new good film three main character far good work though last episode give little bad emotion chemistry actor play dickey turn chemistry actor play tom act overall bad give much anything also see complaint freddie play woman non binary read review sure correct nomenclature actor say frankly give good performance feel flat affect performance like rest good scene police inspector little tension could really inspector favorite character least give performance try cat mouse conflict quite happen leave care die anyone catch dickey tom suppose real chemistry lead tom believe dickie feel tom suppose master impersonate people con people none believably pull even attempt even unexplained plot hole demand knowledge book totally lose even make far slow slow dealbreaker pay lack much murder scene bore problem guess european art house style purposefully try portray dry dialogue even emotional moment black white long shot stair reason exaggerate bore style act help plot act plug along monotonously pick last two episode sometimes film try hard avant gard work min movie would well series need keep captivate want watch see something happen anyone rat either see movie try seem like high brow art film buff way disappoint go watch talente mr ripely cleanse brain give gorgeous italian feel burn tension scream
2	"Very good show.ABC is the best company currently broadcasting. No one is better.Funny how the self-declared ""Christian values"" station is the only one aside from its partner in wedded bliss, ABC Family, that produces shows centered around WOMEN and dedicated to the growth of all. Props to this show for being real about trying to explore grief and PTSD.I really hate Christina and Owen. I'm kind of surprised that anybody likes them together. He seems to be using her, and their 'I'll be with you even when you're an asshole because I feel sorry for you' mutually codependent caretaking thing is irritating.Every single woman on this show seems involved with a man who is her boss or is ranked higher than she is at her workplace. This is not healthy behavior, nor it is something y'all ought to be encouraging.Little Grey and Mark Sloan dating is a little bit disturbing--there is such a thing as too much of an age difference to be able to work things out. I'm not sure if y'all are trying to be sexist or just inadvertently going there, but c'mon. Three supersmart women are dating older, more highly ranked men? Eew.Things not dealt with satisfyingly on the show however include--Meredith's Mom's death, Addison's departure and the how and why of it, Rebecca's life and disappearance from the show, Mark's feelings for Addison, Meredith's suicidality: fact or fiction, and George's death.The list is growing.Y'all--substituting briefly adrenaline-pumping events is not sufficient replacement for actually watching characters grasp and deal with new events in their lives and painful goodbyes.That used to be what made this drama great, was its capacity to witness the human element of drama as a slow but steady process. The show used to be better at dealing with real pain, not pain obviously manufactured to attract viewers to the season finale.When people stop watching your show, work on making it better, don't insert bizarre random dramatic events in hopes of attracting former viewers scared of watching their favorite characters die.That is LOW, and may get you what you want for a short while, but it will also ensure you go to the dark and scary place...which is fitting, because the writers appear unwilling and unable to deal with anything remotely dark OR scary since Izzy's tumor, if not before.My personal thoughts, but c'mon. Y'all are better than this. By y'all I mean the writers, actors and actresses you are wonderful as ever. Writers, get your mojo back. These folks deserve scripts that kick ass, not linger incessantly on stuff no one really cares about anyway while cutting out all the truly good stuff.Make it a feminist show again, not merely a show about women."	good show abc good company currently broadcast one well funny self declare christian value station one aside partner we d bliss abc family produce show center around woman dedicate growth prop show real try explore grief ptsd really hate christina owen kind surprise anybody like together seem use even asshole feel sorry mutually codependent caretake thing irritate every single woman show seem involve man boss rank high workplace healthy behavior something ought encourage little grey mark sloan date little bite disturb thing much age difference able work thing sure try sexist inadvertently go c mon three supersmart woman date old highly rank man eew thing deal satisfyingly show however include meredith mom death addison departure rebecca life disappearance show mark feel addison meredith suicidality fact fiction george death list grow substitute briefly adrenaline pump event sufficient replacement actually watch character grasp deal new event live painful goodbye use make drama great capacity witness human element drama slow steady process show use well deal real pain pain obviously manufacture attract viewer season finale people stop watch show work make well insert bizarre random dramatic event hop attract former viewer scar watch favorite character die low may get want short also ensure go dark scary place fit writer appear unwilling unable deal anything remotely dark scary since izzy tumor personal thought c mon well mean writer actor actress wonderful ever writer get mojo back folk deserve script kick ass linger incessantly stuff one really care anyway cut truly good stuff make feminist show merely show woman
0	"If you're inclined to race and gender swap to appease certain brain dead audiences, at least attempt to write, direct and cast actors who can carry the part of their professions. This formula driven adaption of Liu Cixin trilogy is almost laughable how bad the characters are. For example, Eiza González who plays Auggie Salazar acts and behaves more like a depressed office receptionist than a ""brilliant' scientist. Jovan Adepo who plays the brilliant Saul Durand speaks and acts more like a 10th grade burned out chemistry teacher who part times as a assistant coach than a brilliant scientist. The writing and direction has that a CW vibe . This show would be a perfect pairing on the CW after Nancy Drew or Riverdale."	incline race gender swap appease certain brain dead audience least attempt write direct cast actor carry part profession formula drive adaption liu cixin trilogy almost laughable bad character example eiza gonz lez play auggie salazar act behave like depress office receptionist brilliant scientist jovan adepo play brilliant saul durand speak act like th grade burn chemistry teacher part time assistant coach brilliant scientist write direction cw vibe show would perfect pair cw nancy draw riverdale
2	If you are going to remake a classic mini series , this is the was to do it. I won't go into the plot of the series but just to say I am so far very impressed at how these first 2 episodes have panned out. The original 1980's series was very impressive for its time and Is worth checking out if you haven't seen it.But this remake has so far proved to be superior in scope and attention to detail and script. The acting and characterisation is sublime.Obviously a lot of research has gone into the production and the casting of the main characters. I would recommend anyone interested in this period of history to check it out.	go remake classic mini series go plot series say far impress first episode pan original series impressive time worth check see remake far prove superior scope attention detail script act characterisation sublime obviously lot research go production cast main character would recommend anyone interest period history check
